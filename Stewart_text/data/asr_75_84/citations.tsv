Analysis of their argument using service sector data defining the tertiary more narrowly than their data fails to provide confirmation. Respecification of their analysis to fit an alternate interpretation of their theoretical argument also fails to find the service sector playing a role in generating inequality, and even indicates it may reduce inequality. However, portions of their argument are used to suggest that inequality may play a role in increasing service sector size in less developed countries. This idea is examined using panel regression techniques, and receives empirical confirmation.

McDill	American Sociological Review	41	6	1976-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 963-980	American Sociological Association	fla		A multivariate "school process" model is evaluated to explore the antecedents and consequences of curriculum enrollment. Selected characteristics of peer associates, measures of academic achievement and three subjective outcome variables--educational plans, self-conceptions of academic competence and intellectual orientations--are considered. The analysis, based on questionnaire and testing data for a sample of high school seniors, identifies academic ability and status origins as important determinants of curriculum placement. Curriculum enrollment and other school process variables, including characteristics of peer associates and academic performance, contribute uniquely to the explanation of subjective orientations and serve as important mediators of background influnce. Evidence is provided for the substantial importance of curriculum enrollment for both cognitive an noncognitive outcomes of schooling, as well as, by implication, for retention in school.

Alwin, Arland Thornton	American Sociological Review	49	6	1984-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 784-802	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper explores the potential role of family socioeconomic factors in school achievement outcomes at two separate periods in the lifecourse-early in childhood and during late adolescence. Using data from an 18-year longitudinal study of families and their children which provides measures of parental socioeconomic characteristics across this entire period, we examine several issues related to the influence of early and late family factors on achievement outcomes assessed during the period of the completion of secondary schooling. We examine the extent to which differing conclusions are reached through the use of parental socioeconomic variables assessed during these two periods, and we explore the question of the relative impact of these two sets of influences. Our results indicate that, in part due to the intertemporal consistency of some socioeconomic variables, most relationships are quite similar using either the early or later variables. While these patterns make it very difficult in some instances to ascertain the relative effects of early and late socioeconomic factors, our analytic results point to a potentially stronger role of early socioeconomic factors in cognitive development and school learning. In a single instance-the case of family size-we find independent effects on school achievement from both early and late socioeconomic experiences.

This paper tests the Keynesian notion that the degree of direct government involvement in the economy should reduce income inequality through such means as full employment and the facilitation of economic growth. A regression analysis of data from 32 nations indicates that the degree of direct government involvement in the economy is the single most important factor associated with low income inequality. This relationship is independent of both the level of economic development and the rate of economic growth.

In this paper, attempts are made to relate the rate of growth of public secondary and tertiary school enrollments to changes in occupational opportunities. Models of public secondary expansion are estimated for two periods, 1922 to 1951 and 1952 to 1979, but models of tertiary enrollment expansion could be estimated only for the later period. The findings suggest, in part, that students use schooling as a means of preparation for anticipated future occupations. Additionally, however, enrollments were affected by the current demand for the labor of school-age workers, suggesting that schools may "warehouse" otherwise unoccupied individuals, but only during periods in which the level of schooling in question was discretionary. This dynamic has little to do with the utility of schooling as a means of preparation for adult occupational roles.

Kritz	American Sociological Review	47	6	1982-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 810-818	American Sociological Association	fla		Using a sequential-events model, the relationship between female employment and fertility during a five-year interval in the 1970s is analyzed among married women in urban areas of the Dominican Republic. Although significant proportions of the variance of all interval events are explained, no relationship is observed between proximate employment and fertility. Some evidence, however, of an inverse long-term relationship is provided. Unlike findings in the United States and other countries, incompatibility between the roles of market and household worker appear minimal in the Dominican Republic. Evidence of significant recent changes in nuptiality among younger women suggests that changing employment conditions may have a stronger direct effect on fertility at an earlier stage of the life cycle.

Preston	American Sociological Review	47	2	1982-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 253-264	American Sociological Association	fla		Simple relations between life cycle and population measures are developed by reference to steady-state models in which age schedules of fertility, mortality, and attributes are fixed. Comparison among steady-state models having different mortality and fertility conditions permits a demonstration of the differential influence of demographic conditions on populations and life cycles. In general, fertility differences affect populations but not life cycles, whereas mortality differences affect life cycles but not (to an important extent) populations. The size of effects is shown to depend upon differences between the mean age of the stationary population and the mean age of persons with the attribute in the stationary population. The most interesting class of models pertains to situations in which population characteristics are constrained and force alterations in life cycles in response to demographic change.

Kalleberg	American Sociological Review	42	1	1977-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 124-143	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper attempts to develop a theory of job satisfaction which incorporates differences in work values and perceived job characteristics as key explanatory variables. It empirically examines the relationship between job satisfaction and the work values and job rewards associated with six dimensions of work--intrinsic, convenience, financial, relations with co-workers, career opportunities and resource adequacy. It is found that work values have independent effects on job satisfaction. The extent to which workers are able to obtain perceived job rewards is conceptualized to be a function of their degree of control over their employment situations. The paper also seeks to develop a framework which links the variation in the job satisfactions of workers to the factors that influence the degree of their control over the attainment of job rewards in American society. The analyses in this paper are based on data from the 1972-73 Quality of Employment Survey.

Bielby	American Sociological Review	49	2	1984-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 234-247	American Sociological Association	fla		This article integrates the concept of work commitment-the centrality of the work role as a source of intrinsic satisfaction-into the study of sex-role attitudes and women's employment. Limitations of previous attempts to operationalize work commitment are reviewed and a measurement model approach based on multiple indicators of a construct that is not directly observable is presented. Five hypotheses are derived and tested with a statistical model of the relationship between work commitment, early socialization, school experiences, family roles, and employment behavior. Applying the model to longitudinal data on female college graduates shows work commitment to be both stable over time and empirically distinct from sex-role attitudes. In this population, intermittency of employment was not a consequence of unstable work commitments, and subjective investments in the work role remained stable at the same time these women adjusted their employment behavior to accommodate the demands of child rearing. These findings suggest the viability of studying work commitment in more recent cohorts and in other populations.

Rossi	American Sociological Review	49	1	1984-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1-19	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper reviews demographic trends in longevity and the sex ratio, marriage and fertility, and household composition for the illumination they provide to an understanding of parenting in individual lives and to the social ambiance surrounding childbearing and -rearing in contemporary society. Second, the paper reviews gender differences in parenting as reflected in recent research on solo fathering and mothering, nontraditional family arrangements, and egalitarian marriages that show significant paternal involvement in childrearing. Third, the paper assesses the adequacy of current social explanations of gender differences in parenting, and demonstrates the relevance of an expanded explanatory model that draws upon bio-evolutionary theory and the neurosciences.

Vaughn	American Sociological Review	46	4	1981-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 393-405	American Sociological Association	fla		For a class of social actions such as seeking a job, the socioeconomic standings of the contact (social resources) an individual uses will probably be very important in achieving a desired result. Drawing upon data from a sample of working males aged 21-64 in the metropolitan area of Albany-Troy-Schenectady, New York, we found that the job seeker's personal resources (initially his family background, but more importantly later his educational and occupational achievements) as well as his use of weak ties affect his ability to reach a contact of high status. The contact's status, in turn, has a strong and direct effect on the prestige of the attained job. As job experience increases, a person relies more on constructed rather than ascribed relations and the strong tie between his contact and the hiring firm becomes increasingly important.

Choldin, Claudine Hanson, Robert Bohrer	American Sociological Review	45	6	1980-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 972-983	American Sociological Association	fla		Contrary to conventional urban theory, recent studies have found "suburban persistence" in social status, over time. This concept is challenged here, in an examination of change in relative status of places. Three simple indexes of relative status are introduced and analyzed over time in a cohort analysis. It is shown that status typically rises for about two decades after a suburb is built and then it declines. Thus, like city areas, suburbs follow the neighborhood life cycle. Earlier studies which found suburban persistence are criticized for using panel designs in combination with correlational statistics, which were unable to detect the kind of change occurring in metropolitan areas.

Bucuvalas	American Sociological Review	45	2	1980-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 302-313	American Sociological Association	fla		In an effort to contribute to an empirically based "sociology of knowledge application," this paper explores the frames of reference that decision-makers employ in assessing the usefulness of social science research for their work. Analysis of responses of 155 decision-makers in mental health fields to 50 actual research reports reveals five frames of reference: relevance of research topic, research quality, conformity of results with expectations, orientation to action, and challenge to existing policy. All frames are positively associated with perceived likelihood of using a study. Two significant interactions among the frames suggest that, in essence, decision-makers apply a "truth test" and a "utility test" in screening social science research. They judge truth on two bases: research quality and/or conformity with prior knowledge and expectations. They also assess utility on alternaive bases: feasible direction for action and/or challenge to current policy. The ways in which they apply research conclusions to their work is a broader, more diffuse, and wider-ranging process than many earlier investigators have recognized.

Empirical support for this charge and material for constructing an alternate model have been offered in recent revisionist studies of the Civil Rights Movement. This alternate model emphasizes the importance of deliberate planning and pre-existing social structures in the development and growth of bus boycotts and sit-ins between 1955 and 1965. Reexamination of the Civil Rights Movement in Tallahassee, Florida, shows it to be a case which does not fit the alternate model in important respects. It is concluded that while organization and planning are key variables, social movement theory must take into account spontaneity and emergence, and the transformation of pre-existing structures.

During that time Jews have drifted away from the Orthodox religious affiliations which the earlier studies (Snyder, 1958; 1978) found to be important in maintaining low alcohol problem rates, and yet these rates remain low. Data from a detailed study of Jews in an American community suggest a revised explanation that focuses upon four protective social processes: (1) association of alcohol abuse with non-Jews; (2) integration of moderate drinking norms, practices and symbolism during childhood by means of religious and secular ritual; (3) restriction of most adult primary relationships to other moderate drinkers; and (4) a repertoire of techniques to avoid excess drinking under social pressure. The results are discussed from the perspective of informal social controls.

Cohen	American Sociological Review	41	4	1976-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 630-637	American Sociological Association	fla		The process of developing an adequate measure of segregation occupied the literature for over a decade and culminated in the widespread use of the Index of Dissimilarity. The inadequacies of this index, although identified by the Duncans (1955), remain with us and largely have come to be ignored. This research further explores the difficulties pertaining to limitations in the use and interpretation of the Index of Dissimilarity, demonstrates some of the systematic biases resulting from these inadequacies and provides a mathematical refinement which overcomes some of the major problems inherent in the use of this index.

A reassessment of the theoretical considerations involved indicates that Parsons' preoccupation with the potentiality for status competition and conflict between working spouses has led to a distorted view of the problem of status consistency within the family. The argument presented here is that, if the wife is to work, it is important that her occupation reflect favorably on the family's socioeconomic position and this need for status maintenance, if not improvement, offsets the presumed need for her occupation not to be status threatening. In addition, it is suggested that Parsons overestimated the amount of disruptive competition which would necessarily occur if both the husband and wife worked. Some empirical evidence is presented to support this alternative view of women's socioeconomic role in the family.

Kluegel	American Sociological Review	43	3	1978-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 285-301	American Sociological Association	fla		Recent studies have shown an improvement in the socioeconomic circumstances of black Americans. Yet a substantial difference remains, raising the question of what accounts for this difference. In this paper we examine the role of job authority (position in the authority hierarchies of organizations) as a source of this persistent discrepancy. Based on the comparison of samples of white (n = 1,088) and black men (n = 625) we find that: (1) the average job authority of black men is markedly lower than that of white men; (2) this discrepancy has its source in a number of factors including organizational characteristics, education, occupational position, and direct within-occupation exclusion from authority; (3) black men receive a lower income return to authority than do whites, with the discrepancy in income return being especially pronounced at higher occupational status levels; and (4) the exclusion from authority is costly; on the average across occupations it accounts for approximately one-third of the total black-white income gap.

Phillips	American Sociological Review	48	4	1983-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 560-568	American Sociological Association	fla		The impact of mass media violence on aggression has almost always been studied in the laboratory; this paper examines the effect of mass media violence in the real world. The paper presents the first systematic evidence indicating that a type of mass media violence triggers a brief, sharp increase in U.S. homicides. Immediately after heavyweight championship prize fights, 1973-1978, U.S. homicides increased by 12.46 percent. The increase is greatest after heavily publicized prize fights. The findings persist after one corrects for secular trends, seasonal, and other extraneous variables. Four alternative explanations for the findings are tested. The evidence suggests that heavyweight prize fights stimulate fatal, aggressive behavior in some Americans.

Roos	American Sociological Review	48	6	1983-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 852-864	American Sociological Association	fla		Employing data from 12 industrial societies, the present paper investigates differences in the labor force behavior, occupational distribution, and attainment patterns of ever and never married women. The analysis tests one explanation for occupational sex segregation-dual career theory, which attributes women's concentration in low-paying employment to gender differences in marital and childrearing responsibilities. The results for the twelve countries offer some support for the assertion that never married women are more similar to men than ever married women, but not in all respects related to their occupational behavior. Although marital responsibilities affect the extent to which women work and the kinds of jobs in which they are employed, these differences for the most part do not translate into differences in occupational prestige or wage rate. Thus, women's economic disadvantage, relative to men, cannot be attributed solely, or even in large measure, to gender differences in marital responsibilities. Never married women, who have no immediate marital responsibilities, do not fare much better than married women in their occupational attainment.

Gray Swicegood	American Sociological Review	49	3	1984-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 359-372	American Sociological Association	fla		Prior work on the determinants of the first-birth process can be divided into three approaches: (1) time-series analysis focusing on description and determinants of trends; (2) cross-sectional studies examining childlessness or adolescent fertility; and (3) life-course studies dealing with the timing of fertility relative to other events. Drawing on these traditions, our conceptual framework places the first-birth process within, respectively, an aggregate-time dimension indicated by period or cohort, an individual-time dimension indicated by the respondent's age, and a social-structural dimension indicated by the respondent's ascribed and achieved characteristics. By pooling six fertility surveys spanning the 1955-1976 period, and examining conditional birth probabilities, our analysis incorporates each of these dimensions. Each dimension is important. Aggregate time exerts powerful and pervasive effects. Socio-structural variables have nonproportional effects-that is, their effects vary with individual time. The effects of the social-structural variables tend not to interact with the aggregate-time dimension. Finally, predictive power generally declines with individual time.

It does not differentiate itself into newsworthy events for reporting and publication. News is a product of reality-making activities and not simply reality-describing ones. A critical sociological task is to examine newsworkers' transformations of the everyday world into published or broadcasted events-as-stories (Molotch and Lester, 1974; Tuchman, 1972; 1973a; 1973b; 1976; Glascow University News Group, 1972; Cohen, 1972; Cohen and Young, 1973). This paper details one core aspect of this process, the routines newsworkers use to identify and display the newsworthy character of occurrences and events. Historically, newsworthiness has been viewed as a property of events in an external social order. Relying on primary and secondary data collected in several news organizations, an alternative conceptualization, consistent with basic tenets of ethnomethodology, is provided in this paper. Here, newsworthiness is an actively generated feature of events.

In the resulting partial-service vacuum, blacks invented numbers gambling. Numbers-gambling banks became sources of capital and a major savings device of urban black communities. In conjunction with the usury industry, numbers banks framed an alternative institutional system for the savings-investment cycle in the slum. Numbers banking illustrates the conjoint contribution of institutional and cultural causes in analysis of poverty.

Craig Jenkins, Charles Perrow	American Sociological Review	42	2	1977-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 249-268	American Sociological Association	fla		Drawing on the perspective developed in recent work by Oberschall (1973), Tilly (1975) and Gamson (1975), we analyze the political process centered around farm worker insurgencies. Comparing the experience of two challenges, we argue that the factors favored in the classical social movement literature fail to account for either the rise or outcome of insurgency. Instead, the important variables pertain to social resources-in our case, sponsorship by established organizations. Farm workers themselves are powerless; as an excluded group, their demands tend to be systematically ignored. But powerlessness may be overridden if the national political elite is neutralized and members of the polity contribute resources and attack insurgent targets. To test the argument, entries in the New York Times Annual Index are content coded and statistically analyzed, demonstrating how the political environment surrounding insurgent efforts alternatively contains them or makes them successful.

Tickamyer	American Sociological Review	43	4	1978-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 541-557	American Sociological Association	fla		Studies of female labor force participation and fertility have established a negative relationship between the two; however, there has been much debate over the direction and causes of this relationship. In this paper, two causal models of the actual fertility and work behavior of a national sample of married women, aged 30 in 1970, are examined using the two-stage least-squares technique to disentangle reciprocal effects. Included are a two-variable feedback loop incorporating only fertility and labor force participation and a three-variable model which adds sex role attitudes to the endogenous variables. Most of the work-fertility relationship can be accounted for by controlling background variables such as education and marital duration. A negative effect from fertility to labor force participation remains, however. Adding sex role attitudes to the model as a potential source and consequence of fertility and work behavior slightly reduces the size of this effect.

Mullins, Paul Sites	American Sociological Review	49	5	1984-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 672-685	American Sociological Association	fla		Stratification literature documents the importance of social inheritance in attaining elite status and recognizes that resources for status attainment vary with social group and historical era. This study focuses on resources historically specific to the black experience in examining the social inheritance of stratification in the black community. Using a random sample of eminent blacks and data on female and male lineages, contemporary eminent blacks were found to be predominantly the descendants of families characterized by antebellum freedom, lighter skin, urban residence and higher education and occupational attainment. Mothers were important in the transmission of achievement values, often making a critical difference. Importance of family was demonstrated by the educational attainment of siblings.

Hewitt	American Sociological Review	41	5	1976-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 838-849	American Sociological Association	fla		Structural and interactionist theory share a parallel set of weaknesses in their ability to account adequately for the relationship between culture and action. Structural theory takes socialization as the major link between culture and conduct and thus generates an overdetermined and unrealistically rigid view of action. Interactionist theory, because of its focus on the improvisational and emergent character of action, finds it difficult to account for the massive fact that patterns of belief and action persist over time. The concept of aligning actions provides a bridge between structural and interactionist perspectives, lending the former a more satisfactory view of the formation of conduct and the latter a means of explaining persistence.

Gortmaker	American Sociological Review	44	2	1979-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 280-297	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper examines the theoretical and empirical relationship of income poverty to infant mortality differentials in the comtemporary United States. Using national data gathered in 1964-65, this study estimates the relative impact of a variety of biological, social, and economic factors upon the risk of infant death. Methods for the analysis of multidimensional contingency tables permit the combination of birth and death data, and coefficient estimates from these models provide estimates of the relative risks of infant death observed in various subpopulations. Within the white population of legitimate births in 1964-65, coefficient estimates indicate that poverty is associated with relative risks of neonatal and postneonatal mortality 1.5 times greater than that experienced by infants not born in poverty, independent of a variety of maternal and familial characteristics and the birth weight of the infant. Hospital care during the neonatal period, however, appears to attenuate this increased risk for some high risk infants. The estimated direct effects of poverty upon infant mortality are larger than the effects of poverty mediated by the birth weight of the infant. The persistence of poverty and the continuing unequal distribution of health care resources to pregnant women and young mothers in the United States imply the reproduction of these differentials to the present day. Increasing access to health services and increased help to families through income supports and employment programs are indicated as possible policy actions to reduce these differentials.

Ragin, Shelley Coverman, Mark Hayward	American Sociological Review	47	2	1982-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 238-252	American Sociological Association	fla		While there have been many studies of the frequency of strikes, only a few researchers (e.g., Snyder and Kelly, 1976) have studied strike outcomes. This topic has been ignored partly because the dominant perspective in the study of industrial conflict, the resource mobilization perspective, treats strikes as acts that contribute primarily to workers' long-term political interests. We argue that strikes are at least as much acts of economic instrumentalism as they are political acts and that the resource mobilization perspective should address strike outcomes. In this study of the relationship between resource expenditure and strike outcomes, we pay special attention to the way change in the status of a "contender" (Tilly, 1978) affects the relationship between resource expenditure and outcome. Our analysis of the outcomes of 753 major labor disputes in Britain over the 1902 to 1938 period shows that labor's change from challenger to member status improved its returns to collective action.

Consistent with the interactionist method, attention is given to the relationships and actions that constitute the worlds of this social structure. The alcoholic beverage and the drinker-consumer relationship is a central focus of attention from level to level within the tiers of the industry. Special attention is given to criminogenic activities within and among the five tiers of this industry. The historical context and social interactions from which these activities arise are given emphasis. Finally, a tentative schema is suggested for analyzing criminogenic activities within the American liquor industry and, perhaps, within other industries as well.

The analysis differs from those previously published in comparing all groups with white men, including changes in attitudes in the analysis, and dealing in detail with enforcement of the laws. The model developed in the article works well when used to examine increases in nonwhite income, but does not deal satisfactorily with the incomes of white women. The findings indicate that there are important differences between race and sex discrimination which will have to be taken into account in theories of labor market discrimination.

Four theoretical perspectives are drawn upon to set forth alternative predictions of the relationship between unintended and intended births for upwardly and downwardly mobile couples. The results of regression analyses of 1970 National Fertility Survey data lend support to Easterlin's relative economic status hypothesis, which advances the expectation of a positive relationship between direction of mobility and fertility, although this pattern is observed only for unintended births. The implications of this finding for certain theories of fertility, as well as for the inconclusive nature of previous research into the mobility-fertility relationship, are discussed.

Bridges	American Sociological Review	45	1	1980-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 58-75	American Sociological Association	fla		The postulate that women are overrepresented in marginal industries is examined by formulating six hypotheses which relate aspects of industry marginality to female employment. Data from Population and Business Censuses and other published sources are used to evaluate these hypotheses empirically for detailed industries in both the goods-producing and the service sections of the economy. The relationship between industry differences in male/female employment and occupational segregation by sex is taken into account with direct standardization techniques. The results show that women are underrepresented in capital-intensive industries but that their industrial distribution is not strongly associated with a wide range of marginality characteristics. Furthermore, some types of industries (such as durable-goods manufacturing) employ fewer than expected numbers of women, even when the average marginality of industries in those groups is taken into account.

Garnier	American Sociological Review	41	3	1976-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 498-511	American Sociological Association	fla		Using a set of national-sample data on occupational status change in a cross-section of 17 countries, we examined the hypothesized relationship between "level of industrialization" (measured by per capita energy consumption) and the circulatory rate of occupational mobility (defined in terms of the nonmanual-manual-farm classification). Results of the analysis indicated that cross-sectional variations in the rate of circulatory mobility per se were unrelated to the energy-consumption measure. Insofar as the rate of observed mobility covaried with energy consumption, it was because of historical features of the structure of production in the several countries--specifically, the extent to which productivity involved a large labor-intensive agricultural sector during the time of the fathers and the extent to which the structure of production (as represented in the distribution of occupational ranks) changed during the interval of the father-son comparisons.

Hauser	American Sociological Review	40	1	1975-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 37-47	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper is about the logic of interpreting recursive causal theories in sociology. We review the distinction between associations and effects and discuss the decomposition of effects into direct and indirect components. We then describe a general method for decomposing effects into their components by the systematic application of ordinary least squares regression. The method involves successive computation of reduced-form equations, beginning with an equation containing only exogenous variables, then computing equations which add intervening variables in sequence from cause to effect. This generates all the information required to decompose effects into their various direct and indirect parts. This method is a substitute for the often more cumbersome computation of indirect effects from the structural coefficients (direct effects) of the causal model. Finally, we present a way of summarizing this information in tabular form and illustrate the procedures using an empirical example.

First, an argument is made that the quantitative analysis of individual-level data that characterizes much of what is new in the recent sociohistorical literature is not only a methodology for conducting empirical research but also embodies an implicit theory of social organization that is both quantitative and individual. The power of such a theory to explain social change is limited, however, not only by technical problems associated with measurement and sampling error in historical research but also by the absence of an explicit causal component in the model. An alternative perspective, based on Marx's materialist theory of history, and which, it is argued, overcomes these limitations, is then presented. Empirical findings from research on the family in nineteenth century Los Angeles and Duncan's discussion of structural equation models, are used to illustrate how different theories of social change might be empirically tested.

The present paper reports a study of the dynamics specific to one kind of negotiation, that of defining relational control. The data fit a model of a third-order Markov process, implying that the control direction of a given speech depends on the three speeches before it. A digraph of the transition probabilities from speeches at t, t+1, and t+2, to the speech at t+3 shows that interaction tends toward competitive symmetry (a series of speeches asserting control) or equivalent symmetry (a series of speeches which neither assert nor give up control). Assertive speeches lead to competitive symmetry, as do submissive speeches. In contrast, neutral speeches decrease the competitive quality of the interaction. The methodology and findings in the present work have implications for the emerging structural and interactionist approaches in micro-sociology.

Kamens	American Sociological Review	42	2	1977-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 208-219	American Sociological Association	fla		The purpose of this paper is to investigate the relationship between ideology and formal organizational structure in American higher education. To do so, we develop an argument predicated on the idea that colleges and universities affect individuals and the society by: (1) creating membership categories, e.g., "college graduate"; (2) legitimating the social rights and meanings attached to these groups; (3) ritually certifying individuals as members. These processes occur independently of any impact schools have on students. As a result, colleges must create and validate myths concerning the intrinsic qualities graduates possess that derive from the college experience. Organizational structures dramatize the symbolic redefinition of students and legitimate the idea that important changes actually have occurred during college attendance. The effects of given organizational arrangements are established by accepted educational theories and conventional wisdom. It is argued that organizational structure must conform to schools' self-presentation and their advertised effects on students. Schools whose structure and ideology do not match may be under pressure to change or suffer the fate of nonconformity. On the basis of these ideas, we develop a typology of symbolic definitions colleges construct about graduates and discuss how particular organizational features are used to legitimate different conceptions of "student." Data from comparative organizational studies are used to illustrate these arguments and to indicate substantive conditions that limit the applicability of this argument.

Muha	American Sociological Review	49	6	1984-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 751-769	American Sociological Association	fla		It has been commonly assumed that an advanced formal education bestows a more enlightened perspective that is less vulnerable to the narrow appeals of intergroup negativism. Other investigators have argued that education increases commitment to democratic norms, but only at a superficial level. We review the arguments from that debate and then subject them to empirical test with national survey data on the intergroup beliefs, feelings, predispositions for personal contact, and policy orientations of men toward women, of whites toward blacks, and of the nonpoor toward the poor. The results of that comprehensive analysis fail to support the view either that education produces liberation from intergroup negativism or that it produces a superficial democratic commitment. With that ascertained, we depart from the confines of past debate and propose a fresh approach that rests on different assumptions about the nature of both intergroup attitudes and educational institutions. We argue that dominant social groups routinely develop ideologies that legitimize and justify the status quo, and the well-educated members of these dominant groups are the most sophisticated practitioners of their group's ideology. We interpret our data from this perspective and suggest that the well educated are but one step ahead of their peers in developing a defense of their interests that rests on qualification, individualism, obfuscation, and symbolic concessions.

The relationship between each form of prejudice and protest is specified by the respondents' social status.

Five hypotheses are derived which predict relationships between individual earnings and periodic economic fluctuations, as measured by the unemployment rate, for workers in general and for workers in certain social structural locations, defined by education, economic sector, union membership, and race. Results from spectral analyses indicate that periodic economic fluctuations constrain earnings in general over the short term--that is six to seven months. The importance of social structural location is underscored by the finding that those in more advantaged structural locations have earnings patterns which are not related to changes in the unemployment rate, while those in less advantaged structural locations have earnings patterns which are strongly related to changes in the unemployment rate. Both black and white earnings patterns are related to periodic economic fluctuations.

To explain this we examined the black/white split labor market between World War I and the New Deal, showing how blacks were used to undermine white workers and their unions. The conflict was resolved with New Deal Labor legislation, protecting the unions and outlawing undercutting. This permitted a coalition to emerge between black and white workers. But in the long run the rising cost of labor drove capital to seek cheaper labor overseas, to make use of internal pockets of unprotected labor or to automate. All three processes hurt black industrial workers disproportionately, leaving a group of hardcore unemployed in the ghettos.

The replication also investigates the consequences of the type of target population.

Males, however, reveal significantly higher returns than females, even when salience and field procedures have been accounted for.

However, the work presented here suggests that deviance can be thought of as a product of the movement of moral boundaries in a social system, independent of the movement of the actors within that system. Our focus is upon the unresolved problems in the functional theory of social control and the labeling approach to deviance. Also, as an attempt to extend these two approaches, this research includes work on the definition of deviance. The main thrust of the work is to explain how it is that the definition and volume of deviance can change in a particular social system independent of the actions of the deviants within that system. The evidence from this study supports the contention that deviants, independent of their actions, will be more severely rejected and stigmatized following an external threat to their corporate social system.

(1952) in the same urban neighborhood twenty-five years later to test the dynamic hypothesized "loss of community" in urban life. Three indexes reflecting three dimensions of community were explored. "Local facility use" declined, "informal neighboring" showed no change, while "sense of community" increased. The latter two did not decline because the area has attracted residents who economically and ideologically "value" the changes which have occurred in the area and the resulting "ecological niche" which the area has come to occupy. It is middle-class, racially integrated and urban. Residents have consciously sought out this area because of these characteristics and have consciously attempted to create community in part through an active local community organization. Drawing upon Mannheim's distinction between utopia and ideology, the area is defined as a consciously created "ideological community."

This paper considers both theoretical and methodological implications of several common measures of inequality. The Gini index is found to satisfy the basic criteria of scale invariance and the principle of transfers, but two other measures--the coefficent of variation and Theil's measure--are usually preferable. While none of these measures is strictly appropriate for interval-level data, valid comparisons can be made in special circumstances. The social welfare function is considered as an alternative approach for developing measures of inequality, and methods of estimation, testing, and decomposition are presented.

This paper resolves these inconsistencies by clarifying some theoretical and methodological issues. Ecological theory hypothesizes an inverse relationship between ethnic segregation and socioeconomic status. We demonstrate that this hypothesis cannot be tested using the method of indirect standardization, but is appropriately examined using either direct standardization or cross-sectional correlation. Given these clarifications, previous research generally supports hypotheses derived from ecological theory and lends credence to a social class interpretation of ethnic segregation.

Feinberg	American Sociological Review	42	3	1977-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 505-521	American Sociological Association	fla		A simple model of crowds seeking consensus for action is posited. Individual crowd members seek support from a sample of crowd members; successful ones attempt to influence the crowd toward a particular course of action. Consensus is achieved with a sufficiently reduced variability of opinions in the crowd. Independent variables are the initial distribution of opinions, crowd suggestibility and the average position of individuals seeking to influence the crowd. Outcomes of interest are whether consensus is achieved within a given time limit, the rapidity with which consensus is achieved, and the extremity of the consensus position reached. Most of the simulated crowds reach consensus within a given time limit; rapidity and extremity of consensus are considerably affected by interaction among the manipulated variables. A partial mathematical description of the model suggests that the results are nontrivial.

We argue that models which exclude considerations of spatial processes are incomplete and that therefore parameter estimates for such models are misleading. We then develop a model which incorporates spatial autocorrelation, and reanalyze data from one well-known study of the effects of density on fertility using our model. The results show that, with one exception, the effects of density on fertility are trivial, a finding that is quite different from previous research. We conclude that spatial mechanisms are an important consideration in the modeling of social processes that involve geographically defined units.

Disesteem is also greater the more deviant acts one commits and the more disapproved these acts are. Further, performance and deviance may pay off (in esteem and disesteem) at different rates for people of different status. Here we test Goode's predictions in a well-bounded, well-connected subculture with a single central form of activity for which performance quality is clearly measurable. His esteem predictions, which are essential to much of his larger argument, are strongly supported. The results for disesteem lead us to modify his argument. We also investigate the possible role of network size and performance frequency as mechanisms for the translation of performance and deviance into esteem or disesteem.

Frey	American Sociological Review	49	6	1984-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 803-827	American Sociological Association	fla		Lifecourse (age-related) migration patterns played an important role in the racially selective suburbanization of metropolitan populations that took place in the immediate postwar decades. During this period, the members of successive white population cohorts chose suburban destinations just prior to the ages of greatest residential stability, and tended to remain in suburban locations for the remainder of the lifecourse. At the same time, members of black population cohorts were effectively barred from selecting suburban destinations at all ages of the lifecourse. Recent changes in family formation patterns and race relations have prompted expectations that lifecourse migration patterns will change in ways that should bring about a more racially balanced city-suburb redistribution process. This investigation adopts the demographer's cohort-component projection model to examine these expectations for six large SMSAs. White and black lifecourse migration patterns have become more alike in the post-1970 period; yet, significant racial disparities still exist. Recent lifecourse migration patterns do not imply an eventual metropolitan-wide integration of the races.

Two kinds of international economic dependence are studied: investment dependence, the penetration of a country by foreign capital and debt dependence, the dependence of a government on foreign credit. The dependent variables studied include three measures of aggregate economic development: gross national product per capita, kilowatt hours of electricity consumed and the percentage of the male labor force not employed in agriculture. In addition, two control variables are included in the analysis: domestic capital formation and the extent to which the national economy is specialized in mining. The research design employed is panel regression analysis, which utilizes data at two points in time (1950 and 1970). The results indicate that both types of international economic dependence have overall negative effects on aggregate economic development. A cross-sectional estimate of the dependence effects on income inequality produces positive, though not statistically significant effects. It is concluded that dependency theories predict the effects of inputs from advanced nations to less-developed ones better than neo-classical international economic theories or sociological modernization theories.

A method for choosing between the three interpretations with over-time correlations is presented and applied to data on hospitalization for schizophrenia.

Recent attempts to examine these issues within a world-systems context have employed secondary analysis of cross-national surveys of income inequality (Chase-Dunn, 1975; Rubinson, 1976; Bornschier et al., 1978; Weede, 1980; Stack, 1978). These efforts have had to rely upon aggregate data of sometimes dubious reliability and questionable theoretical appropriateness. The present research examines uneven development within a single state (Andhra Pradesh) in one underdeveloped nation (India). It studies 84 agrarian villages, using the rural community as the unit of analysis. The study attempts to generate valid data through the use of both archival methods and first-hand village-level surveys.

Concepts currently used in the study of political conflict suffer from serious theoretical and empirical deficiencies. We therefore introduce the concept of a collective actor, which we treat as an elementary analytic unit in the study of conflict structures in elite systems. We then develop a set of spatial models describing the alternative forms of oppositional structure that have received attention in the literature. Finally, we attempt to demonstrate the utility of our approach in a comparative analysis of two quite different community elite systems.

A comparison of blacks and Chinese in the vice industry, 1880-1940, confirms the guiding role of American society which rewarded ethnics' participation in prostitution but restricted legal earning opportunities. Nonetheless, divergent demographic and cultural characteristics of Chinese and blacks differentially affected the internal organization of each group's vice industry as well as the process of industrial succession. This finding supports a view of illegal enterprise as a synthesis of illegal work that consumers want to buy and what disadvantaged ethnics have to offer. In general, socio-cultural characteristics of provider subgroups define the manner in which they respond to consumer demand for illegal products and services.

In the theories of Parsons and Althusser action is linked to structure by a systems framework in which no theoretically relevant social action occurs outside the system. Both adapted natural science models to explanations of social phenomena by using analogies of the unconscious and of language. Because these theoretical conceptualizations do not enable one to specify the limits of structural effect, it is argued that they are "sociologically reductionist." Alternative conceptualizations are suggested which conceive of social structure as setting limits but not preselecting behavior and as enabling theoretically meaningful choice out of multiple and conflicting pressures on social action. It is then argued that this choice must be incorporated in our theories of the social in order for us to explain social change. Finally, questions are raised about several underlying assumptions which may lead sociologists to sociologically reductionist theories.

The effects of curriculum differentiation on academic achievements (both relative and absolute), educational goals, two behaviors relating to educational goals (application to and acceptance by a college), and social supports for educational attainment are considered. Precurriculum controls at the junior high level on these outcomes provide a stringent assessment of tracking effects not available in prior research. Socioeconomic characteristics of students influence curriculum enrollment in high school almost totally through their effects on achievements, goals, and encouragement during junior high school. Net of numerous pre-enrollment control variables, curriculum placement has important effects on educational outcomes in the junior and senior years; it serves both to mediate the effects of prior variables in the model and to contribute uniquely to the explanation of these outcomes. Curriculum assignments and consequences revealed in the analysis are interpreted in light of functional vs. conflict theories of educational stratification, and it is concluded that neither provides an entirely adequate explanation of such differentiation.

Although studies have consistently found that educational attainment has a delaying effect on entry into parenthood, there has been disagreement about the existence of a reciprocal effect of the timing of entry into parenthood on educational attainment. This paper attempts to resolve that disagreement by analyzing the relationship between women's educational attainment and the timing of entry into parenthood in a way that builds upon and goes beyond earlier studies. Considerable attention is focused on methodological issues bearing on the modeling and estimation of these effects. The analysis, based on data from a fifteen-year follow-up study of high school students originally surveyed in 1957-58 and resurveyed in 1973-74, indicates that the timing of entry into parenthood does have an effect on the educational attainment of women.

Specifically, we examine the effects of the number of rank categories (C) for rank-order variables on the product moment correlation (r) between stretched scales and an equal distance scoring system. The stretched scales are drawn from three types of distributions: (1) the uniform distribution (i.e., the one used by Labovitz), (2) the normal distribution, and (3) a skewed distribution (log-normal distribution). We find that the average correlation (r̄) between the equal distance scoring system and the stretched scale is quite high for both the uniform and normal distributions, and that r̄ increases with C only when C is greater than four or five. Thus, contrary to suggestions in the literature, r̄ is not a monotonic function of C. More importantly, for the skewed distribution, r̄ is a monotonically decreasing function of C and is substantially smaller than r̄'s based on uniform and normal distributions. The implications of these findings for the use of Pearson's r with rank-order values are discussed.

It is argued that the relationship between differentiation and coordination is stronger in profit than in nonprofit organizations. Results for samples of small short-stay general hospitals support the hypothesis, even when a number of other variables are controlled. It is concluded that the profit-nonprofit orientation of organizations may be an important contingency in the relationship between organizational variables and that more theoretical and empirical attention should be given to it.

It investigates how variations and interactions in the use of these coordination mechanisms and modes are explained by task uncertainty, interdependence and unit size. Nine hypotheses that relate these three determining factors to the use of the three coordination modes are developed in order to test some key propositions of Thompson (1967) and others on coordination at the work unit or departmental level of organization analysis. Research results from 197 work units within a large employment security agency largely support the hypotheses. The findings suggest that there are differences in degree and kind of influence of each determining factor on the mix of alternative coordination mechanisms used within organizational units.

Bielby	American Sociological Review	45	5	1980-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 737-765	American Sociological Association	fla		This essay examines the shift toward "structural" explanations in recent studies of inequality. After reviewing this body of research and some of its shortcomings, we examine its theoretical underpinnings, comparing "structuralist" perspectives on work organization derived from institutional economics and neo-Marxism to more orthodox accounts based on neoclassical and "industrialism" theories. This discussion suggests areas where the different perspectives overlap and diverge. We conclude that work arrangements within the firm and their trend are the focus of most "structural" perspectives on positional stratification; thus, empirical studies grounded at the organizational level are more likely to inform current debates about the "structure of work" than is the growing body of research about structural effects on individual attainment or covariation among industrial/occupational characteristics. Toward that end, an agenda for future research is outlined, focusing on three aspects of work organization: (a) the units which comprise the structure of work and the dimensions underlying economic segmentation; (b) the effects of sectoral differentiation on technical and administrative arrangements within firms; and (c) temporal changes in how enterprises organize production. We provide some illustrations of the kinds of empirical data and research hypotheses required to link research on segmentation and stratification more closely to studies of organizations.

Those cultural elements which characterize an interacting group are termed the idioculture of the group. This approach focuses on the content of small-group interaction, and suggests that the meanings of cultural items in a small group must be considered in order to comprehend their continued existence as communication. Five characteristics of cultural items affect which items will become part of a group culture. Cultural forms may be created and continue to be utilized in situations if they are known to members of the interacting group, usable in the course of group interaction, functional in supporting group goals and individual needs, appropriate in supporting the status hierarchy of the group, and triggered by events which occur in group interaction. These elements have impact only through the interpretations of group members of their situations. Support for this approach is drawn from a participant observation study of Little League baseball teams.

Lincoln	American Sociological Review	41	1	1976-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1-15	American Sociological Association	fla		Hawley's theory that the distribution of system power in the urban community is related to its capacity for mobilization on public issues is examined in the framework of a model specifying mobilization, the scope of municipal government, the MPO ratio and organizational dimensions of system power (employment concentration and absentee-ownership) as consequences of the city's functional role in an urban division of labor. The model treats mobilization as an unobserved variable mediating the effects of community structure on three policy variables: municipal government expenditures, urban renewal and poverty program funding. Coefficients estimated under the model suggest that, while the MPO ratio is strongly dependent on urban function and organizational structure, its direct effect on mobilization is stronger than effects produced by these factors. The model postulating mobilization is then compared with the results of separate regressions calculated for each policy variable. The data indicate that it constitutes a reasonably good fit to regression estimates where municipal expenditures and urban renewal success are dependent variables but not in the case of poverty funds. With regard to the latter, the organizational measures of system power prove more important than the MPO ratio. Furthermore, governmental scope is found to be a moderately important variable intervening between elements of community structure and policy consequences, but its influence is considerably less than that of other variables in the model. In conclusion, general support is claimed for an ecological approach which views urban public policy as the end result of a sequence of conditions originating with city size and economic function.

It is hypothesized that involvement in domestic activities negatively affects wages and is likely to be an important factor in explaining women's lower wages relative to men. Findings from OLS regression analyses of white, currently employed, currently married women and men indicate that domestic labor time significantly decreases both sexes' wages. In order to assess whether this relationship differs by class, the sex-specific earnings equations also are estimated within the working class and the non-working class. The negative effect of domestic labor time on both sexes' income persists in the within-class analyses. Working-class men are more vulnerable to the detrimental influence of domestic production. Unexpectedly, housework and child care time decreases non-working-class women's wages more so than working-class women's wages. It is noted that these findings should be interpreted with caution due to the cross-sectional nature of the data which precludes an unequivocal assessment of potential nonrecursivity in the linkages among key variables in the model. Overall, the findings imply that a more equitable distribution of work in the home is necessary before labor market inequalities between the sexes can be ameliorated.

Correlation coefficients suggest that both antiquity and wealth are important determinants of status, but the histories of the city companies suggest that organizational or political factors are also important. The investigation is not simply of historical curiosity; it suggests an alternative strategy for the study of occupational prestige in contemporary societies.

This theory is challenged, however, by evidence that urbanism is not associated with residents' having any fewer social ties or suffering higher psychological stress. An alternative theory contends that urbanism produces fear and distrust of "foreign" groups in the public sphere, but does not affect private social worlds. This new survey study supports the latter explanation by reconfirming earlier findings and showing that urbanism is not correlated with distrust of neighbors but is correlated with distrust of "other people" in the wider community.

The existing theoretical and empirical literature is reviewed in order to identify those factors believed to be associated with the deterrence of criminal behavior. Based on a sample of 174 undergraduate students at a small, private university, this study evaluates the additive and interaction effects of several independent variables, the degree of moral commitment to the legal norm, the perceived threat (certainty and severity) of punishment, and patterns of differential association on self-reported criminality. Employing a complex correlational analysis and a multivariate analysis of variance, the existence and magnitude of the relationships among the variables studied were found to be contingent on the level of analysis (individual versus offense), the level of perceived certainty of punishment, the level of conformity or commitment to the legal norm, the type of offense (e.g., offenses against the person) and sex role.

Partitioning mobility into relative (circulation) mobility and mean (structural) mobility reconciles some of the contrary predictions. Analysis of the Occupational Changes in a Generation Study data confirms that the relationship between total mobility and fertility is weak and not always significant. However, when total mobility is partitioned into relative mobility and mean mobility, the results suggest that fertility behavior is consistently negatively related to mean mobility and positively related to relative mobility.

Williams	American Sociological Review	49	1	1984-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 141-146	American Sociological Association	fla		We examine the hypotheses, derived from the dependency/world-system literature, that the degree of penetration of peripheral countries by foreign capital contributes to the formal exclusion of nonelite political participation and to the greater frequency with which governments actively repress opposition. Analysis of cross-national data from the 1960s and 1970s provides only weak support for the first hypothesis. Further, no direct effects of dependence on repression are found. However, political exclusion has a significant positive effect on our measure of government repression, and this leaves open the possibility that dependence increases the repressive activity of governments indirectly, through its effect on political exclusion. We discuss these results in light of Bollen's (1983) recent findings, and we point out an apparent paradox which future research must address.

Reanalyses of data from previous studies fail to produce consistent results even when major differences in samples, models, and methods are held constant. Differences in substantive interpretations implied by analyses in which different measurement models are specified and in which other methodological sources of regression-slope fluctuation are evident are also illustrated. Regression-slope differences across groups in models of attainment provide ambiguous evidence on which to base statements about differences in the attainment process.

Pitcher	American Sociological Review	42	2	1977-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 338-354	American Sociological Association	fla		This is an investigation of two models of arms races: Lewis F. Richardson's linear, additive, symmetric model and a curvilinear, asymmetric alternative based on the same interaction paradigm but with empirical equations from psychophysical experiments on perception as premises. Two hypotheses derived from each model are tested using data from seven arms races. In general, the data give stronger support to the curvilinear, asymmetric model which predicts the follower in the arms race will increase its armaments through time as an exponential function of the leader's armaments, and the leader will increase its armaments as a power function of the follower's efforts at the previous time period. The conclusions are based on the relative fit of the models to the seven sets of data, parsimony, reasonableness of the parameter estimates as adjudged by their signs and magnitudes, and predictions about the outcomes of the races--war or armed truce.

Four dimensions of worker-technology relations emphasized in previous research are analyzed: skill and variety, diversity, technical interdependence, and control over work pacing. We find pervasive gender differences in the forces affecting worker-machine relations: ascriptive characteristics and schooling are more decisive for women; and, because there is a more rigid differentiation among women's technical roles, occupational and job characteristics exert a greater influence on relations to machines and technology than is the case for male workers. Results indicate that individual attributes minimally affect workers' positions within the technical division of labor; factors governing the organization of jobs and firms are more decisive. The implications of these results for theoretical debates and future research concerning work and inequality are discussed.

None of these differences are found when adults from the growing community are compared to adults in the same three control communities, and none can be explained by sociodemographic background factors (including length of community residence). The study's ethnographic data strongly suggest that the reasons for the anomalous findings are predominantly social and cultural in nature and are not strongly affected by the types of economic and logistical factors that have been the focus of most analyses to date.

A study of the political evolution of the Greek Cypriot community after the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974 suggests three additional conditions: (1) political elites must be sufficiently unified to be able to arrive at a consensus on a policy to deal with the conflict; (2) there must be a minimal consensus among group members that this policy is capable of satisfactorily resolving the conflict; and (3) in societies with deep political divisions one side should not be able to blame the other(s) for the emergence of the threat.

We find variations between metropolitan regions in the direction and extent of change in inequality between suburbs. Inequality tended to increase in the 1960s in metropolitan regions with a highly fragmented local governmental structure and to decline in regions with fast-growing populations, especially those which experienced substantial suburbanization of employment.

Blau	American Sociological Review	47	1	1982-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 114-129	American Sociological Association	fla		The hypothesis tested is that variations in rates of urban criminal violence largely result from differences in racial inequality in socioeconomic conditions. Data on the 125 largest American metropolitan areas (SMSAs) are used to ascertain whether this hypothesis can account for three correlates of violent crime differently interpreted in the literature. Criminal violence is positively related to location in the South, which has been interpreted as the result of the Southern tradition of violence. It is positively related to the proportion of blacks in an SMSA, which has been interpreted as reflecting a subculture of violence in ghettos. And it is positively related to poverty, which has been interpreted as the emphasis on toughness and excitement in the culture of poverty. The analysis reveals that socioeconomic inequality between races, as well as economic inequality generally, increases rates of criminal violence, but once economic inequalities are controlled poverty no longer influences these rates, neither does Southern location, and the proportion of blacks in the population hardly does. These results imply that if there is a culture of violence, its roots are pronounced economic inequalities, especially if associated with ascribed position.

The view that Latin American fertility has not responded to increasing modernization because the Roman Catholic Church is a powerful pronatalist institution is tested with a historical model. Characteristics of Spanish rule before 1830 and 19th century immigration patterns are determinants of the level of modernization and Catholic institutional strength in 1900. Modernization reduces crude birth rates in 1910 and later years and also depresses illegitimate and marital fertility. A strong negative effect of Catholic strength on illegitimacy is counter-balanced by its strong positive impact on marital fertility.

Hauser	American Sociological Review	49	1	1984-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 19-38	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper reanalyzes 3-stratum intergenerational mobility classifications, assembled by Hazelrigg and Garnier for men in 16 countries in the 1960s and 1970s. Log-linear and log-multiplicative models are used to compare mobility regimes and to estimate effects of industrialization, educational enrollment, social democracy, and income inequality on immobility and other parameters of the mobility process. Several models of mobility fit the data equally well, so criteria of plausibility and parsimony are applied to choose one model of stratum-specific immobility and another model of vertical mobility with uniform immobility. We find substantial similarity in mobility and immobility across countries, but the exogenous variables do explain systematic differences among countries. Cross-national variations are complex because most of the exogenous variables have different effects on different parameters of the mobility regime. Relative to other factors, industrialization and education have weaker effects on mobility regimes than has usually been supposed.

It finds that there are people who move across sector and across sex-typicality boundaries, but that individuals' credentials and work histories have little power to explain this mobility. Moving into the competitive sector depresses chances for wage gains, while moving out of this sector brings gains. Moves between typically male and typically female occupations, on the other hand, do no affect relative wage outcomes.

We provide a specification of the components of the model as well as the linkages between components. This construction of the underlying model allows us to evaluate it systematically as a model, to consider and to evaluate each component and linkage separately. While we conclude that there are several important contributions to retain from the dual approach, including the insight that capital structure conditions labor market outcomes, we argue that it is inadequate for sustaining theoretical and empirical development. As a new starting point for the study of economic and labor market segmentation we suggest a resource perspective which retains insights from the dual approach but avoids its overly restrictive assumptions.

First, large differences in salary between minority/sex groups remain after occupational stream and a number of employment-related variables are controlled. Second, institutionalized discrimination explains only one-half of these salary differences. Finally, within the federal civil service, the pay structures of minority and nonminority women are more similar to each other than are the pay structures of any other two groups of employees.

Arguments from dependency and world system theory suggesting such a relationship are first derived. Next, a regression analysis of the relations of political democracy to world system positions and economic development is undertaken. Using partial regression plots, six countries that appear to be misclassified on the Snyder and Kick (1979) world system measure are identified. A reanalysis of the data with these cases reclassified demonstrates the negative influence of peripheral and semiperipheral positions on democracy for the full sample as well as random subsamples. Throughout the analysis economic development has a significant, positive effect on political democracy.

McGranahan	American Sociological Review	45	2	1980-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 313-324	American Sociological Association	fla		Drawing on the concepts of metropolitan spread and central place hierarchy, this paper develops a spatial model of income distribution in rural regions. Central to the model is the argument that proximity to growing metropolitan centers and community commercial centrality affect incomes differentially, in ways that depend on education, age, and proprietorship. It is argued that these differential effects are reflected in the distribution of income across and within communities, having implications for community stratification, structure, and, following Molotch (1976), the differentiation of interests in community growth.

Wayne Osgood	American Sociological Review	49	4	1984-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 526-540	American Sociological Association	fla		In most sociological treatments of crime and delinquency, genetic explanations are either ignored or ridiculed. While the belief that single genetic defects produce delinquent behavior is untenable, modern genetic theory is concerned with the influence of many genes on normal human behavioral variation. This analysis of genetic variation can be united with sociological theory. In particular, a twin study of the covariation between delinquent behavior and association with delinquent peers is used to demonstrate the value of a behavioral genetic analysis for developing social theory. The phenotypic correlation between self-reported "delinquency" and the "delinquency of friends" is apportioned to three theoretical sources: genetic variation; common environmental influences that affect family members equally; and specific environmental influences that affect each individual uniquely. Of the three component sources, genetic factors contributed most to the phenotypic covariation in this study. Although genetic factors are implicated, this result does not mean that delinquency is either a direct result of biological differences or that it is inevitable. Rather, it shows that causal sequences leading to delinquency are traceable to individual differences in genes, so any social causation entails either individual differences in reactions to social processes or differential social reactions to already differing individuals. Implications of behavioral genetic analyses of covariation for theories of delinquency are discussed.

According to previous research, economic development seems to have little impact, whereas state strength or dependency, and democracy are more useful predictors of income inequality. Here it is argued that much sociological research rests on misspecification of the relationship between economic development and income inequality, and therefore needs reanalysis rather than uncritical acceptance. A partial reanalysis of previous studies, avoiding specification error, first demonstrates a moderately strong curvilinear relationship between economic development and inequality; second, it casts considerable doubt on state strength or little dependency as equalizers of income; third, it reconfirms a cross-sectional correlation between democracy and less inequality, even after proper controls for economic development.

One is to discover the responses that individuals give spontaneously; the other is to avoid the bias that may result from suggesting responses to individuals. The first goal can be satisfied through careful pretesting, whereas the second requires that open questions be used in the final questionnaire. We examine both goals by means of experiments within large-scale sample surveys. A widely used closed question on Work Values is first compared with a parallel open question, and then the responses to the latter are used to reformulate the closed alternatives in new comparisons. More limited experiments on two other items also are discussed. In all cases there are large and reliable differences between question forms in univariate distributions, and in most cases important differences in bivariate relations also occur. An attempt is made to explain and reconcile both kinds of differences. The evidence suggests that if closed alternatives initially are constructed on the basis of sufficient open responses, then remaining open/closed differences may be due mainly to interviewing and coding problems with open questions, rather than to bias from closed questions.

Findings suggest that the modern corporation is not an autonomous unit as suggested by managerialism, that firms do not form flexible alliances which pursue mutual interests as implied by coalition theory, and that the interest groups of traditional finance capital theory do not characterize the interlock network of the 1960s. Instead, the system is dominated by a handful of interconnected major New York commercial banks and insurance companies which form the center of an integrated national network.

Glenn	American Sociological Review	41	3	1976-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 484-498	American Sociological Association	fla		A study of a U.S. national sample of females ages 25 through 40 reveals a moderate association of education, and a weaker association of physical attractiveness, with husbands' occupational prestige. Consistent with earlier findings reported by Elder, the contribution of education to females' status attainment through marriage seems to vary positively with level of origins and the contribution of attractiveness seems to vary inversely, except that the apparent effects for farmers' daughters resemble those for high-origin rather than low-origin females. The contribution of attractiveness seems almost nil for both farmers' daughters and high-origin females and does not seem to vary systematically by age. Among daughters of low-manual workers, education and attractiveness seem to interact, so that each enhances the utility of the other. It is concluded that the exchange involved in mate selection must be very complex and that the major exchange theories of mate selection probably underestimate the influence of highly variable needs, preferences and tastes.

The key assumption is unidimensionality, an assumption which underlies recent investigations into the convergent and discriminant validity of various modernity scales. I show that this assumption takes for granted what needs to be proven and, therefore, violates the null hypothesis axiom. Using data from a five nation study of individual modernity, I statistically examine this assumption and demonstrate its inappropriateness to modernity research. I close with an interpretation of patterns of modernity in the five nations. These patterns have been derived from factor solutions that meet statistical tests of dimensionality. The results suggest that existing modernity data should be reanalyzed.

The study focuses on the role of the postdoctoral fellowship, a career event that is thought to validate predoctoral performance and foster later professional success. Analyses of covariance show sex interactions for both the predoctoral determinants and the occupational consequences of the postdoctoral experience (award receipt and prestige), which persist when marital status is taken into account. Such sex-fellowship interactions fail to occur only for the impact of the fellowship on productivity, indicating a prestigious award-enhanced scientific output for both sexes. These results seriously question whether achievement norms govern status attainment for female scientists and whether science is, in fact, unique in its normative structure.

Alba	American Sociological Review	41	6	1976-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1030-1046	American Sociological Association	fla		The current resurgence of interest in white ethnicity largely has taken the form of asserting the continued vitality of ethnic communities. Current scholars, following Gordon's (1964) well-known distinction between acculturation and social or structural assimilation, acknowledge the great extent of acculturation but maintain that, nonetheless, social assimilation has not taken place. They claim, in other words, that primary relationships are generally between individuals of like ethnicity. This paper, using data about Catholic national-origin groups in the early 1960s, finds little support for these present assertions of ethnic vitality.

Estimates are made of the extent of overeducation and its distribution among different categories of workers, according to sex, race, age, and class background. The effects of overeducation are examined in four areas of worker attitudes: job satisfaction, political leftism, political alienation, and stratification ideology. Evidence is found of significant effects of overeducation on job satisfaction and several aspects of stratification ideology. The magnitude of these effects is small, however, and they are concentrated almost exclusively among very highly overeducated workers. No evidence is found of generalized political effects of overeducation, either in the form of increased political leftism or in the form of increased political alienation. These findings fail to support the common prediction of major political repercussions of overeducation and suggest the likelihood of alternative forms of adaptation among overeducated workers.

Milburn	American Sociological Review	46	5	1981-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 660-669	American Sociological Association	fla		Differences in attitude structure as a function of political involvement are examined using a structural equation procedure with latent variables. In addition, criticisms of an earlier Judd and Milburn (1980) paper are examined. Findings suggest that the less involved are less likely to express political attitudes and that when they do their expressions contain more residual variance or error. At the same time, the attitudes of both the involved and uninvolved show evidence of a single underlying ideology that is remarkably stable in all groups. In arriving at these conclusions, a number of points are made concerning the procedures to be followed in comparing latent variable models between groups.

Likewise, the influence of planning interventions on growth rates and community satisfaction is not known. The best predictor of antigrowth policies among Northern California city planning agencies is the percentage white collar population and not, as recent urban literature predicts, relative community status or social homogeneity. The hypothesis that associations between city planning practices and community variables are mediated through local activism is given support. However, growth rates are not influenced by growth controls or the social variables associated with antigrowth policies. Further, a survey of Northern California residents suggests that those living in growth control communities report less community satisfaction.

Dutton	American Sociological Review	43	3	1978-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 348-368	American Sociological Association	fla		The poor, especially children, continue to receive fewer health services relative to need than the affluent. Explanations have traditionally focused on cost constraints or on cultural differences. This paper provides empirical evidence that such explanations do not fully account for income trends in preventive and symptomatic use. A third explanation, based on inadequacies in delivery systems used by the poor, is required. Factors representing each explanation are added sequentially to a multivariate model in order to shed light on their role in the income-use relationships. Particularly instructive are changes in estimates when types of delivery systems are added, since system differences have been ignored in much previous research. The importance of factors promoting use among the poor, e.g., public assistance, is underestimated, while the role of individual characteristics, e.g., attitudes, is overestimated. Results suggest that neither financial access nor health education, without accompanying improvements in delivery systems, will eliminate income differentials in use.

Van Cleave, Diane Mitsch Bush	American Sociological Review	44	6	1979-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 948-967	American Sociological Association	fla		The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of the movement into early adolescence upon the self-esteem of children. Which children are most vulnerable to this role-transition and what is the effect of changes in school environment, pubertal development, and social behavior? With repeated survey interviews and nurses' measurements, 798 school children were followed from sixth into seventh grade in two different types of school systems. Findings indicate that, in seventh grade, white adolescent girls who have entered the new environment of junior high school appear to be at a disadvantage in comparison both to boys in general and to girls who do not have to change schools. Among the girls, the ones with lowest self-esteem appear to be those who have recently experienced multiple changes, that is, who have changed schools, have reached puberty, and who have also started to "date." Among boys, in contrast, early pubertal development is an advantage for self-esteem. These data thus demonstrate the way in which coping with a major role transition can be significantly affected by environmental context, level of biological development, and social behavior.

Smith	American Sociological Review	41	4	1976-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 691-705	American Sociological Association	fla		Hawley hypothesized that success in any collective action is greatest where community power is more highly concentrated. Other research results indicate that community program adoptions and outputs are more closely associated with a dispersion of community power. The resolution of these contradictory findings may depend, in part, on recognizing important differences between various programs. The present research utilizes Froman's distinction of areal and segmental policies to categorize four community programs--urban renewal, public housing, fluoridation and Hill-Burton hospital construction. Replicating Hawley's original analysis and extending it over time to these additional programs shows a differential pattern of association between our measure of power (the MPO ratio) and areal versus segmental programs. The findings shed some light on an important theoretical issue concerning the relationship between community power and policy outputs, and demonstrate the necessity of accounting for relevant policy distinctions in further research.

These two variables are related positively for both sexes, but because women marry earlier than men, the relationship is stronger for women. Analyzing data from a fifteen year follow-up study of the high school students studied by Coleman in The Adolescent Society (1961), this paper examines sex differences in the determinants of educational attainment and age at first marriage and in the relationship between these two variables. The results, based on estimation of a simultaneous-equation model, indicate that women's earlier age at marriage is an important factor limiting their educational attainment. Age at first marriage has no significant effect on the educational attainments of men but has a stronger effect on the educational attainments of women than any of the variables usually considered in male models of the educational attainment process. Educational attainment also exerts a stronger effect on the timing of marriage for women than men, although it has a significant effect for both sexes.

The purpose of this paper is to show that the cohesiveness and permeability of culture producing communities differ between artistic and scientific fields as well as across the specific disciplines constitutive of each field, and that these contrasts are not stable over time. Correspondingly, the same variability characterizes the role played by paradigms in the definition of creative norms, in the rhetorics that professionals use to justify these norms, in the socialization of new practitioners and in the occurrence of scientific or esthetic revolutions.

Campbell	American Sociological Review	41	6	1976-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 981-992	American Sociological Association	fla		While sociologists have been interested in the stratification process at ages when members of a cohort experience many changes, attention has been focused most on the beginnings of the socioeconomic career. Though many changes also occur later in life, relatively little attention has been given to them. In this paper, the effect of aging on the relation of status variables to income is analyzed through a comparison of status attainment models for a cohort before and after most of its members have retired. Data for the earlier period are from the 1962 OCG survey and, for the later period, are from the combined 1973, 1974 and 1975 NORC General Social Survey. The analysis shows little change in the pattern of effects. Within the restricted age range, age has trivial effects. Respondent's education, occupation and marital status have direct effects on income. Overall, the analysis suggests a great deal of continuity in the determinants of income. Despite the potentially disruptive effects of changes at this age, the relation of status variables to income remains almost untouched in old age.

Ross, John Mirowsky, Joan Huber	American Sociological Review	48	6	1983-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 809-823	American Sociological Association	fla		Marriages in the United States are shifting from the complementary type, in which the husband is employed and the wife cares for the household and children, to the parallel type, in which both spouses are employed and both are responsible for the housework. This change, however, is far from complete. Disjunctions in the institution of marriage may be stressful and emotionally disturbing. We hypothesize that the effect of a wife's employment on her depression and her husband's depends on their preferences for her employment and on whether the husband helps with the housework. Using data from a national sample of 680 couples interviewed in 1978, we find that both spouses are less depressed when the wife's employment status is consistent with their preferences. Also, wives are less depressed if their husbands help with the housework, and husbands are not more depressed as a result of helping. These factors lead to the highest depression in transitional marriages. The lowest depression is in parallel marriages.

Bollen	American Sociological Review	44	4	1979-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 572-587	American Sociological Association	fla		This research explores the relationship between development timing and political democracy. A number of social scientists have argued that the conditions favoring political democracy have deteriorated over time so that the late developing countries are less likely to be democratic than are the early developers. Another perspective suggests that with the worldwide diffusion of the democratic ideology there is a great deal of pressure for the later developers to adopt democratic forms of government. For a large sample of countries, this analysis reveals no significant relationship between the timing of development and the level of political democracy. However, when more specific characteristics of development timing are explored, some significant effects are found. In particular support is found for the hypotheses that the greater the extent to which a culture is Protestant-based, the greater the level of political democracy; and the greater the state's control of the economy, the lower the level of democracy. In a panel analysis, changes in political democracy are found to be negatively related to the state's economic control but not significantly related to Protestantism. In all of the regressions the level of development has a more significant direct effect than the various timing measures.

Trott	American Sociological Review	47	3	1982-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 347-364	American Sociological Association	fla		The usual analysis of status attainment has ignored important dimensions of both education and occupation and has consequently underestimated the role of education in the occupational attainment process. We examine four aspects of British educational attainment (years of schooling, type of school attended, examinations passed in school, and qualifications obtained) and four aspects of occupations (prestige, authority, control, and earnings). The analysis is conducted for four ten-year age cohorts of British men. Findings include: (a) No single dimension of educational attainment suffices to represent the effects of education on occupation. (b) Different patterns of the educational attainment measures are important in explaining different dimensions of occupational attainment. (c) The degree to which educational attainment is important for occupational attainment depends on the dimension of occupational attainment considered. (d) The persistent importance of school type in explaining occupational outcomes suggests the importance of "chartering" in British education. (e) The full model varies greatly in its ability to explain occupational outcomes, indicating that alternative models will need to be constructed.

Camilleri	American Sociological Review	40	5	1975-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 616-644	American Sociological Association	fla		Voluntary participation in collective-good decisions is formulated as an exercise of individual choice within a context determined by the authority structure and the agreement structure of an organization. A choice model developed by Camilleri and Berger (1967) is used to explicate the nature of a collective-good decision. Organizational variables are interpreted as determinants of the parameters of the individual's choice to participate or not. Three sets of experiments comprising 15 conditions were conducted to investigate the substantive implications of the formulation. Each condition involved multiple replicates of organizations each with eight simulated members and a subject. Participation rates calculated from the model, using estimates of utility ratios derived from the data, closely matched the rank-order of observed rates within sets of experiments and less closely matched the rank-order of the differences between those observed rates. The results were supportive of the overall argument. Implications with respect to considerations of size, efficacy and structural complexity are discussed.

This paper suggests that mother's occupation also is an important dimension of this mobility process. Analysis of data from a national sample of women 30 to 44 in 1967 shows that, when controlling for age and race, a necessary and sufficient model of women's intergenerational occupational mobility includes mother's as well as father's occupation. Whether or not the mother had an occupation outside the home and what occupation she held, given that she was employed, both affect daughter's occupational destination.

Though the mean level of anti-black prejudice was higher in the South, the variation of individuals around the mean in each region can be explained by roughly the same variables operating for the most part in the same way. The regional differences in anti-black prejudice cannot be accounted for by compositional differences between the regions in psychological characteristics, degree of urbanization, socioeconomic status or ethnic composition. Those who spent most of their childhood in one region but later moved to the other had attitudes toward blacks that were intermediate between those of the nonmigrants in each region; this pattern was not present for the other types of prejudice. The evidence presented tends to support a subcultural interpretation of the higher level of anti-black prejudice in the South in 1964.

In both disciplines: (1) the literature argues that the explanations of hierarchy structure are based upon differences in individual characteristics among group members; (2) although critical examination reveals that these explanations require stringent conditions to account for commonly occurring kinds of hierarchies in humans and animals, the available data indicate such conditions are not met; and (3) the hierarchy-formation process has not been adequately studied. In an attempt to alleviate the current problems in hierarchy research, I present the results of a particular animal study and develop a general explanation as to how hierarchy structures arise. This approach applies to both humans and animals and serves as a model of how the cumulative patterns of interactions among individuals produce group social structures.

Scott Long, Robert McGinnis	American Sociological Review	46	4	1981-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 422-442	American Sociological Association	fla		An earlier study found that while a scientist's productivity does not affect the prestige of the academic position obtained, the prestige of the position does affect later productivity. In this paper consideration of contextual effects is broadened to include differing organizational contexts of scientific employment. Chances of obtaining employment in a particular context are not strongly affected by productivity. Once employment is obtained in a specific context, individual levels of productivity soon conform to characteristics of that context. These results do not support the idea that scientists are allocated to organizational contexts on the basis of their scientific contributions. Past research indicating that the most productive scientists are recruited to academic locations may have confused the cause of a scientist working in a given context with the effect of working in that context.

Carter	American Sociological Review	44	3	1979-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 347-366	American Sociological Association	fla		Blacks and five white groups are compared in terms of their rates of inclusion in Who's Who between 1924 and 1974. Of the groups considered, only the English exceed the national average through the end of World War II, although the other groups began to move up during this period. Jews have moved sharply ahead of the English since then, Scandinavians are now close to the English, and Italians and Slavs have increased sharply. The black rate is lowest of all, and did not move up until after World War II. There is evidence of increased assimilation between the white groups, with their sources of eminence becoming increasingly similar. However, there were and are sharp differences between blacks and whites in the pathways to national eminence. A detailed examination of the sources of each group's national prominence provides powerful clues to the differences between the forces affecting blacks and the new immigrants from South-Central-Eastern Europe, as well as between the newer and older white groups in the country. Although some immigrants with worldwide reputations were admitted, the role of immigration in generating nationally prominent Americans is misunderstood. Black sources of national eminence have shifted radically since World War II from the patterns found in 1924 or 1944.

The distribution of attainments, or the structure of inequality, is assumed fixed and is described by a simple exponential or geometric distribution function (depending on whether attainment levels are assumed discrete or continuous). Persons leaving the labor force create chains of vacancies in this structure that present mobility opportunities for persons entering the labor force. The implications of the model for the attainment process derived from these considerations for status attainment research and stochastic models for job mobility are discussed.

Position in the academic stratification system, according to the normative structure of science proposed by Merton, should be allocated universalistically on the basis of a scientist's contribution to the body of scientific knowledge. Our analyses, however, show that after controlling for the effects of doctoral origins and the prestige of the mentor, preemployment productivity has an insignificant effect on the prestige of the scientist's first academic position. This basic finding is elaborated by examining the effects of postdoctoral fellowships, additional characteristics of the doctoral department, and the academic rank of the position obtained. In no instance does preemployment productivity affect the prestige of the first job. The universalistic nature of the scientific stratification system is assessed by comparing those factors which determine job allocation to those which predict scientific productivity later in the career. It is found that prestige of a scientist's first teaching position is least influenced by those factors which are most predictive of future productivity and most influenced by those factors which are likely to involve ascriptive processes.

Brieger	American Sociological Review	41	1	1976-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 117-135	American Sociological Association	fla		An idealized pattern (a "blockmodel") of the interaction among 107 scientists in a biomedical research speciality is identified across networks of several distinct types of relationship. This pattern is sustained by the data. Groups of scientists who share common "positions" in the multiple network structure are identified. Inferences concerning the stratification of these groups are derived solely from a consideration of the patterns they induce on multiple networks. These inferences are then assessed in the light of (non-network) career attributes of individual scientists. Substantive findings from previous studies in the sociology of science are re-assessed in the light of blockmodel analysis.

Yet survey research data consistently show the absence of family background measure effects on high school grades. It is argued that conventional measures of family background fail to capture those cultural elements of status that make a difference in school interactions. Drawing on Weber's work on status groups and status cultures, and on Bourdieu's work on cultural capital, this paper reports the findings of an effort to assess the impact of one component of status culture participation--cultural capital--on one aspect of life chances--students' high school grades. A composite measure of cultural capital has a significant impact on grades, controlling for family background and measured ability. The pattern of relationships, however, differs strikingly by gender.

Logan	American Sociological Review	44	5	1979-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 843-850	American Sociological Association	fla		In this paper, panel models for crime rates and arrest rates are utilized to separate the effect of law enforcement from several other processes that have been advanced as possible determinants of an enforcement-crime relationship. When models of this type are estimated for official index crime rates in a sample of U.S. cities for the years 1964-1970, no meaningful relationship between arrest rates and crime rates is found. This finding permits us to exclude the existence of any appreciable deterrence effect.

Postwar Determinants of Family Income Inequality	Judith Treas	American Sociological Review	48	4	1983-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 546-559	American Sociological Association	fla		The expansion of social welfare has been promoted as one means of equalizing the distribution of economic well-being. Macroeconomic expansion has been touted as an alternative strategy for improving the lot of the poor. Focusing on the postwar era, this paper provides an empirical assessment of these two competing theories of income redistribution. For female-headed families and unrelated men and women, the growth of public transfers is seen to be the major force behind a reduction in income disparities. Only husband-wife families and men living apart from kin seem to have experienced any distributional impact of business cycles.

This assumption has focused considerable attention on such concomitants of the assumed increase as growth in bureaucratic control and internal labor markets. This paper gives the first systematic empirical account of the evolution of workplace size, and presents results that call into question the appropriateness of the current allocation of research energy. It is suggested that far more attention be paid to analysis of small firms and establishments.

While his philosophical interests at the time of writing (1925) centered on philosophy of history as ground for substantive social theory, following the methodological lead of Lukács, Conservatism is Weberian in its theoretical design. Mannheim employs the empirical approach of the new academic sociology to establish findings which link a politically radical philosophy of history to conservative thought while suspending his own judgment concerning an adequate integration between them. Although he indicates that Hegel's conception of theory anticipates the synthesis required, he finds that this conception presupposes metaphysical or sociological premises he cannot accept. He nevertheless also distances himself from the ``disillusioned realism'' of Weber, and leaves open the project of finding a functional equivalent for Hegel's metaphysics or Lukács' Marxist economism.

Doyle	American Sociological Review	42	5	1977-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 743-755	American Sociological Association	fla		Recent reformulations of the societal reaction theory argue that the thesis is a perspective rather than a theory, and that the perspective is meant to provide a set of sensitizing concepts to those researching deviance. This research examines the degree of congruence between hypotheses deduced from those assertions and a set of real world occurrences. Data for a sample of male defendants charged with felony offenses are examined to estimate the effects of (1) deviants' social attributes, (2) the specific societal reactors, (3) the values placed on certain offenses and (4) the organizational imperatives of the deviance-controlling organization, controlling for the alleged offense, on the probability of being labeled and sanctioned for deviant behavior. Our analyses indicate that characteristics associated with the alleged offense account for more of the explained variance in the labeling decision examined here (full prosecution) than in the sanctioning (sentence severity) decision. Moreover, while we find the deviants' social attributes do have some significant effects, relative to the effects of other variables, these effects are small and not always in the predicted direction. We suggest the interactionist perspective shift its focus toward greater attention to organizational imperatives and the values and expectations of those meting out the societal reaction as key variables explaining the imperfect correlation between deviant acts and the reaction to same.

Both of these approaches are shown to be inadequate because they presuppose the logical separation of individual and society. A third approach, which conceives of individuals and society generating each other via a continuing process of negotiation is proposed. Such an approach leads to a "quality of life" defined in terms of the outcomes of these negotiations; at a single point in time these are called the sovereignties of individuals and settings. Sovereignties are thus conceptualized as patterns of commitment made by individuals among settings, and conversely. It is suggested that these patterns of commitment be measured as the joint allocation of money, time, skill and sentiment by individuals and settings. Assessment of quality of life in chronic illness is used as an example.

Data on a regional (Minnesota) network are used to verify several descriptive hypotheses drawn from the existing literature concerning interlocking directorates. We conclude that corporations are more likely to make reciprocal board linkages asymmetric than they are to reciprocate asymmetric ties, popular firms are just as likely as less popular firms to be recruited to new boards, popular firms are more likely than less popular firms to leave boards, and nonfinancial business organizations are more likely to form new board ties with commercial banks and insurance companies than with other nonfinancial firms.

Alexander	American Sociological Review	43	2	1978-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 177-198	American Sociological Association	fla		Contemporary discussions of Parsons's thought have faltered because they are insufficiently generalized. Only after his theoretical and epistemological logic has been explored, for example, can his more specific, ideological purpose be correctly understood. Parsons's theoretical ambition has been to resolve long-standing antinomies in social thought. His theory, to the degree it succeeds, formulates two central points: the social basis of individual autonomy and the multidimensional basis of social order. These positions present the heart of Parsons's formal theory. In his analysis of historical development as differentiation--cultural, structural, and psychological--Parsons combines this formal logic with an ideological commitment to the expansion of individual freedom and conscious control. Incorporating elements of liberal, idealist, and materialist arguments, he outlines a theory of substantive voluntarism that is, potentially, neither conservative nor static. Considered as a whole, Parsons's theory contains serious contradictory strains. Nevertheless, his analysis of formal and substantive freedom represents a major contribution to social thought.

Zucker	American Sociological Review	42	5	1977-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 726-743	American Sociological Association	fla		Traditional approaches to institutionalization do not provide an adequate explanation of cultural persistence. A much more adequate explanation can be found in the ethnomethodological approach to institutionalization, defining acts which are both objective (potentially repeatable by other actors without changing the meaning) and exterior (intersubjectively defined so that they can be viewed as part of external reality) as highly institutionalized. Three levels of institutionalization were created in the autokinetic situation to permit examination of the effects of institutionalization on three aspects of cultural persistence: generational uniformity of cultural understandings, maintenance of these understandings, and resistance of these understandings to change. Three separate experiments were conducted to examine these aspects of cultural persistence. Strong support was found for the predictions that the greater the degree of institutionalization, the greater the generational uniformity, maintenance, and resistance to change of cultural understandings. Implications of these findings for earlier approaches to institutionalization are discussed.

Rosenfeld	American Sociological Review	46	2	1981-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 159-174	American Sociological Association	fla		The use of differential equations models to study social processes has been increasing rapidly. There are, however, ambiguities in the interpretation of the parameters of these models. We suggest that the interpretation of the parameters can best be developed by focusing on the equation for the trajectory over time of the dependent variables (the integral), rather than on the equation for the instantaneous rate of change (the differential equation). The equation for the trajectory can be decomposed into two distinct and substantively meaningful components: one describing the speed of the process away from initial levels of the dependent variable, and one describing factors affecting the value of the dependent variable reached at equilibrium. The interpretation of parameters of dynamic models is illustrated with reference to research on two substantive topics: political mobilization and intragenerational mobility.

When several continuous variables are collapsed into ordinal categories, the measurement errors introduced may be correlated. This condition violates the assumptions of classical measurement theory. Using simulated data and a multiple indicator approach, we examine the problems that surround categorization error. In general, our results indicate that while categorization error does produce distortions in multiple indicator models, under most of the conditions that we explored, the bias was not sufficient to alter substantive interpretations and the estimates were efficient. Caution is warranted in the use of two-, three- or four-category ordinal indicators, particularly when the sample size is small, as the estimates tend to be biased and inefficient.

Their diverse epistemologies rest upon equally diverse ontological assumptions. Blumer's naturalistic inquiry neither compliments Mead's methodological perspective nor facilitates the examination of Mead's theoretical ideas. Several experimental studies of "taking the attitude of other" are discussed, one by Mead's student Leonard S. Cottrell, which are consistent with Mead's methodological perspective. That perspective is equally applicable when exploratory-descriptive research is required. Many problems of naturalistic methodology are avoided by recognizing the different domains of meaning for investigator and investigated, by reducing the scope of behavior to be examined, and by increasing control of the investigator's behavior regarding that which is examined. An illustrative study is discussed.

Carroll	American Sociological Review	40	3	1975-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 389-401	American Sociological Association	fla		After reviewing some of the methodological difficulties which have faced investigators trying to investigate the rise of revitalization movements, the methodological advantages of studying the acceptance of the Ghost Dance (circa 1889) by North American Indians are delineated. These advantages are: (1) a relatively large number of tribes (N=37) were all exposed to what was more or less the same revitalization movement; (2) information on the degree to which each tribe accepted the movement is available from a source contemporary to the event and (3) information relating to some of the social characteristics of these tribes is available from Murdock's Ethnographic Atlas. The sample thus provides what is probably a unique opportunity for quantitatively testing several hypotheses relating to the acceptance of revitalization movements. After ascertaining that diffusion alone could not account for acceptance of the Ghost Dance, several other hypotheses, derived from different theoretical frameworks, were tested. Thus, using a "cultural deprivation" argument, it was predicted, and found, that those tribes recently deprived (because they were living in areas in which the buffalo had only recently been exterminated) were far more likely to accept the Ghost Dance than those not recently deprived. The assertion--implicit in Worsley's analysis of Cargo Cults--that acceptance of a revitalization movement would vary inversely with degree of political centralization was not supported by the data. Finally, based upon a consideration of the social conditions promoting "integration" in Durkheim's sense of that word, it was predicted, and found, that acceptance varied inversely with the presence of unilineal kin groups and with the presence of a system of inheritance.

Nagel, Celesta Albonetti	American Sociological Review	45	5	1980-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 802-820	American Sociological Association	fla		While sociologists have long debated the relationship between the status characteristics of criminal offenders and the sentences they receive, they have done so with data sets drawn from state courts whose prosecutorial resources are focused almost entirely on low status defendants. Qualitative and quantitative data analyzed in this paper are drawn from ten federal district courts whose statutes and resources provide greater potential for the prosecution of the white-collar crimes of higher status offenders. Three questions are addressed: (1) Are there substantial jurisdictional differences in the prosecution of white-collar cases? if so, (2) Are there corresponding jurisdictional differences in the sentencing of white-collar cases? and (3) Within jurisdictions, are there further differences in the factors that influence sentencing decisions in white-collar as compared to other kinds of cases? The data are analyzed from a perspective that emphasizes organizational considerations: we conceptualize the criminal justice process as a loosely coupled system and the use of prosecutorial resources as proactive and reactive. We argue that the expanded prosecution of white-collar persons for their white-collar crimes requires a proactive prosecutorial policy and a tightening of the coupling between plea negotiations and sentencing decisions in the prosecutorial and judicial subsystems. Our quantitative analysis reveals that one district follows a uniquely proactive pattern. As expected, this proactive district also exhibits a unique leniency in the sentencing of college educated white-collar criminals that is related to earlier plea and charging decisions. A rather different and unanticipated pattern of leniency is found in this district for less educated white-collar offenders. A conclusion of this study is that there may be an inverse relationship between the volume of white-collar prosecutions and the severity with which they are sentenced.

Pearlin	American Sociological Review	40	3	1975-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 344-357	American Sociological Association	fla		Emotional stresses that are experienced in marriage are traced to differences in spouses' status origins. Linking status differences to such stress are a number of intervening conditions. People to whom status advancement is important and who have married mates of lower status are apt to have a sense of loss that leads, in turn, to a disruption of reciprocity, expressiveness, affection and value sharing in marital exchange. Such disruptions then act as immediate antecedents to emotional stress. It is through this process that the status order of the larger society can reach out to have a deleterious influence on the emotional states arising out of marital transactions.

Cook	American Sociological Review	46	5	1981-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 619-631	American Sociological Association	fla		The appropriate use of ability test performance in evaluating schools has been a subject of considerable debate. The present study evaluates three strategies for controlling input-level ability differences in such research: longitudinal, predetermined ability measures; cross-sectional, endogenous ability measures; and SES measures as proxies for ability. In general, endogenous measures of ability behave much like predetermined measures, while SES measures are, for many outcomes, seriously deficient as proxies for ability measures. We conclude that research that has relied upon cross-sectional data to control for student ability is not seriously flawed because of this, and that the omission of ability controls altogether is a much more serious failing.

The Israeli system of education activates a series of institutionalized controls to promote centralized public policies with regard to educational and occupational opportunities. Hence, individual goals and plans for future careers are severely constrained by formal mechanisms such as an early separation of more promising students from less able ones, differential training of various classes of students through distinctive types of high schools and the granting of official credentials in the form of various diplomas and licenses. Such institutional arrangements are one form of a "sponsored" mobility system within which the role of informal, interpersonal influences on levels of career aspiration is rather limited, particularly in later stages of the educational process. Empirical findings obtained in Israel support this thesis. A comparative analysis which draws upon American studies points to some cross-cultural implications for further research.

Kelly	American Sociological Review	42	1	1977-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 105-123	American Sociological Association	fla		Although quantitative studies increasingly dominate analyses of conflict, issues of data validity have received little consideration. However, in a recent article, Danzger (1975) shows that differential location of wire service offices across U.S. cities biases newspaper data on racial conflict frequency and concludes that other studies (particularly of racial disorders) which rely on news sources are similarly invalid. We challenge Danzger's treatment and develop an alternative model of validity (which is defined strictly as the probability that events will be reported; we do not deal with the accuracy of published characteristics of events). Our model specifies validity as a function of event intensity and media sensitivity, each of which is dependent on several indicated factors. Intensity determines the relative probabilities that different forms of conflict behavior will be reported. However, precise reporting probabilities also depend on media sensitivity to conflict events. This model indicates the conditions under which news reports are valid sources of conflict frequency data and generates hypotheses--including no bias in racial disorder studies--opposite Danzger's. We report findings from two separate analyses: (1) racial disorders across 673 cities from 1965 to 1969 and (2) largely nonviolent collective protests occurring in 43 U.S. cities during 1968. Both sets of results contradict Danzger's conclusions and support our event intensity-media sensitivity model of validity. We indicate how this model is useful for assessing validity in other analyses of conflict and suggest more general implications for treatments of bias in newspaper data.

Hauser	American Sociological Review	41	3	1976-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 462-483	American Sociological Association	fla		Intercohort shifts in mean education, occupational status and earnings for married persons in the experienced civilian labor forces of 1962 and 1973 represent socioeconomic improvements for both men and women. While the occupational and educational achievements of women have kept pace with men's and indeed exceed the male means, the ratio of female to male earnings has declined from 0.39 to 0.38 for persons in the ECLF. Causal models of the processes of socioeconomic achievement show men and women to be allocated to levels of education and occupational status in much the same manner. Women's achievements are somewhat less related to their family origins, especially farm origins, than are men's, and the net effect of educational attainment on occupational status is larger for women. Intercohort changes in the process of occupational achievement have affected both sexes and include an increase in the net occupational status benefit of an additional year of schooling and a decline in the occupational handicap of farm origins. Equality of economic opportunity for women has not followed from women's opportunities for schooling and occupational status. While the net returns to education have improved more noticeably for women than men, the inter-temporal increases in returns to occupational status have benefited only men. Sexual "discrimination" accounts for 85% of the earnings gap in 1962 and 84% in 1973.

We hypothesize that this is because conflict creates stronger cohesion within the black community and greater support for school desegregation among blacks, which in turn lead to less tension in the schools. The data provide little support for two alternative hypotheses.

This argument, which is a component part of the institutional racism perspective, argues that blacks do not do as well as whites in the Army because of their failure to do well on universalistic criteria such as civilian education or the Armed Forces Qualification Test. Taking promotion time as a measure of inequality, this paper presents data which suggest that universalistic criteria are not sufficient to explain black inequality vis-à-vis promotion time. When black and white enlisted men are matched on key universalistic criteria (civilian education, Armed Forces Qualification Test and occupation type), blacks consistently take more time to make grade than whites. The findings suggest the salience of the notion of ascription: when ascription is based on race, it becomes a component part of racism. Thus, one unavoidably is led by the data in this paper to conclude that the black enlisted man is subject to inequality, which is not the result of failure to meet universalistic criteria but, rather, a result of the racist actions of real-life people.

Myrdal's statement that racial tolerance reflects adherence to a general principle (equal access to educational opportunity) is compared to Blumer's thesis that racial tolerance varies as a function of the perceived position of groups in a racially stratified system. Depending on the racial mixture implied, whites have different levels of tolerance of school desegregation; but regardless of the racial mix, regional differences in tolerance decrease over time. Where differences in tolerance exist among other demographic subgroups of whites, those differences remain relatively constant.

Kasarda	American Sociological Review	40	1	1975-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 55-70	American Sociological Association	fla		Using data from 104 school districts in Colorado, this study examines determinants of organizational effectiveness. Five environmental conditions of these districts, three components of district structure and one of staff composition are linked in a causal model to the median reading and mathematics achievement test scores of the districts' high school students. The environmental conditions are size, fiscal resources, percent non-white in the population of the district's community, and the education and income levels of the parental risk population. The measures of district structure are pupil-teacher ratio, administrative intensity and the ratio of supporting professional staff to teachers. The staff composition variable is qualification level of the professional staff. The results indicate that pupil-teacher ratio and administrative intensity depress median levels of achievement; whereas, staff qualifications foster student achievement. Of the environmental conditions, only percent non-white has consistently significant direct effects on median achievement levels. But other environmental conditions (resources especially) have important indirect effects on achievement via their direct effects on school district structure and staff qualifications.

S. Bureau of the Census. The NCS data reveal that victims' reports of offenders' sex, race, and age are strongly related to incidence rates of offending. The highest incidence rate in personal crimes is for male, black, 18 to 20 year olds. Arrest data at the national level for robbery yield comparable results. Household crimes--burglary, household larceny, and vehicle theft--in which the victims saw and were able to report offenders' sex, race, and age constituted about 5% of all household crimes. The patterns in incidence rates of offending in these household crimes closely parallel those for personal crimes.

Matsueda	American Sociological Review	47	4	1982-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 489-504	American Sociological Association	fla		A number of strong theoretical statements have been based on analyses of delinquency data from the Richmond Youth Project. Hirschi (1969) and Jensen (1972), in particular, found that Hirschi's control theory was empirically supported over Sutherland's theory of differential association. This paper reanalyzes these data and reassesses this negative evidence pertaining to differential association theory. It is shown that the ratio of learned behavior patterns favorable and unfavorable to violation of legal codes, the critical variable in Sutherland's theory, can be operationalized by explicitly modeling its measurement error structure. In turn, this allows the testing of specific hypotheses derived from the theory. The analysis based on this strategy finds differential association theory supported over control theory. Specifically, the unobservable construct representing the ratio of learned behavior patterns successfully mediates the effects on delinquency of the model's other variables.

Previously published data, and analysis of 1975-76 NORC data indicate that about 25% to 32% of American adults have switched religions (including movement out of religion) in their life times. High and Low Status denominations are gaining members due to switching (more in-mobility than out-mobility), and Baptists, Catholics and Medium Status denominations are losing members due to switching. The most common pattern of religious movement is out of religion altogether. Additional analyses show that religious switching patterns are congruent with explanations stressing the switcher's desire to worship with individuals of similar socioeconomic status, that some switching is the result of an individual moving to the religion of a stable spouse, and that movement out of religion is disproportionately composed of young people.

Gieryn	American Sociological Review	48	6	1983-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 781-795	American Sociological Association	fla		The demarcation of science from other intellectual activities-long an analytic problem for philosophers and sociologists-is here examined as a practical problem for scientists. Construction of a boundary between science and varieties of non-science is useful for scientists' pursuit of professional goals: acquisition of intellectual authority and career opportunities; denial of these resources to "pseudoscientists"; and protection of the autonomy of scientific research from political interference. "Boundary-work" describes an ideological style found in scientists' attempts to create a public image for science by contrasting it favorably to non-scientific intellectual or technical activities. Alternative sets of characteristics available for ideological attribution to science reflect ambivalences or strains within the institution: science can be made to look empirical or theoretical, pure or applied. However, selection of one or another description depends on which characteristics best achieve the demarcation in a way that justifies scientists' claims to authority or resources. Thus, "science" is no single thing: its boundaries are drawn and redrawn inflexible, historically changing and sometimes ambiguous ways.

Simkus	American Sociological Review	43	1	1978-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 81-93	American Sociological Association	fla		Earlier studies by Duncan and Duncan (1955), Wilkins (1956), and Uyeki (1964) examined occupational residential segregation in a total of ten U.S. urbanized areas in 1950. The present study is a partial replication of these previous investigations, directed at measuring the changes in residential segregation in these same urbanized areas during the 1950s and 1960s. Changes in the relationship between racial segregation and occupational residential segregation are also examined. Occupational residential segregation between most occupational categories was found to have slightly increased during the 1950s. During the 1960s the degree of residential segregation between service workers and laborers vis-à-vis those in the higher occupational categories decreased, while segregation between persons in the higher categories remained much the same. Indexes of occupational residential dissimilarity calculated within and between racial groups reveal the degree to which gross occupational residential segregation was due to racial residential segregation and differentials between occupational categories in racial composition. These indexes also show that the degree of racial residential segregation depended somewhat upon the respective occupations of the whites and nonwhites whose residential distributions were compared. In 1960, the degree of racial residential segregation was slightly lower between whites and nonwhites in the lower categories. Between 1960 and 1970 nonwhites in the highest occupational categories became slightly less segregated from whites, while whites and nonwhites in the lowest occupational categories became slightly more segregated.

The present work attempts to determine the extent to which such status interventions will transfer across different group tasks and partners. We argue that this problem can be solved using the theory of status characteristics and expectation states by extending the theory to multi-task, multi-partner situations. We tested a set of theoretically derived predictions in a standardized experimental setting. It was determined that (1) differences in educational attainment led to interaction inequalities in an initial collective-task situation; (2) inequalities could be overcome using theoretically prescribed status intervention techniques; and (3) a significant portion of this intervention effect transferred to a subsequent setting involving a new group task and a new partner. Theoretical and applied implications are discussed.

Weis	American Sociological Review	44	6	1979-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 995-1014	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper reviews the research literature concerning the extent to which studies of delinquency that use official records produce results compatible with studies of delinquency that use self-reports of adolescents. Particular attention is given to sex, race, and social class as correlates of delinquency. The notion that official and self-report methods produce discrepant results with respect to sex, race, and class is largely illusory. In reaching conclusions of discrepancy several techniques have been used in the literature; the most general is the assumption that self-reports and official data tap the same domain of behavior. When the domain limitations of self-reports are recognized (and other illusory techniques are abandoned), the conclusion of general consistency between self-reports and official correlates for sex, race, and class emerges. This consistency and other evidence from victimization surveys, studies of the reliability and validity of self-reports, and studies of biases in criminal justice processing, suggest that both official data and self-reports provide valid indicators of the demographic characteristics of offenders, within the domain of behavior effectively tapped by each method.

This presents a potential problem because measures of association between two variables may differ depending on whether continuous or collapsed measures are used. We analyzed simulated data and examined differences in the correlation between two normally distributed continuous variables and the same two variables collapsed into a small number of categories. In general, the differences in correlation coefficients computed on continuous variables and the same variables collapsed into a few categories are small. The greatest differences in the correlations between the two types of variable occur when the continuous variables' correlation is high and only a few categories are used for the collapsed variables. When as few as five categories are used to approximate the continuous variables, the correlation coefficients and their standard deviations for the collapsed and continuous variables are very close. These findings suggest that under certain conditions it may be justifiable to analyze categorical data as if it were continuous.

We assess the accuracy of this conception, using data from a unique set of interviews with 545 top position holders in powerful political, economic, and social institutions in the United States. We examine ethnic representation within the elite as well as its impact on elite activities and interaction. The evidence reviewed here is inconsistent with the usual portrait of an ethnically exclusionary establishment but does indicate that ethnic stratification retains an important impact on entry into the elite.

Here, with a sample of 24 countries, the first of these relationships is assessed. The observed effect of economic development (GNP/capita) on mobility we conclude to be a spurious consequence of the shape of the stratification system, indicated here by the shape of both reward distributions and occupational distributions. Some discussion precedes this analysis about how the shape of a stratification system should affect mobility. Some discussion follows about how the shape of the system must affect political democracy, and leads us to a partial reinterpretation of the findings of Rubinson and Quinlan (1977) on this topic.

But, contrary to what most investigators assume, the amount of nongenetic variation (1-h^2) sets no upper limit on the explanatory power of environmental variation. This is because genetic variation often causes environmental variation, so the two categories are not mutually exclusive. The assumption that the two categories are mutually exclusive derives from a narrowly physiological model of the way in which genes affect behavior. This model is inconsistent with all the most familiar examples of genes affecting behavior, especially the examples of race and sex. Heritability estimates set no upper limit on the potential effect of reducing or eliminating variation in environmental factors that currently vary in response to genotype, as many do. Nor do they set an upper limit on the effect of creating new environments. Heritability estimates do set an upper limit on the effect of reducing or eliminating environmental variations that are independent of genotype, but other statistics usually provide even better estimates of these effects. There is no evidence that genetically based inequalities are harder to eliminate than other inequalities. Until we know how genes affect specific forms of behavior, heritability estimates will tell us almost nothing of importance.

Rossi	American Sociological Review	48	3	1983-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 316-330	American Sociological Association	fla		Our main objective is the measurement of prestige for the full range of men's and women's occupations and of gender incumbency effects on prestige; subsidiary goals include examination of rater and job characteristics. The research design combines the approach of controlled experiments with that of the sample survey. Household and college sample respondents each rate 110 occupations using standard NORC prestige methods and metrics. Our findings support the theoretical assumption that incumbent prestige ratings represent achieved occupational status as modified by ascribed sex of incumbent, rather than as some more equal mix of gender prestige and occupational prestige. Occupation remains the major contributor to prestige. Sex of incumbent affects householders' ratings, while college students do not make this differentiation. Sex composition influences female and high-status raters in each sample. However, the near equity in subjective occupational repute is unrelated to the actual resources of jobs. Methodological conclusions are also drawn.

Peter Archibald	American Sociological Review	41	5	1976-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 819-837	American Sociological Association	fla		The author presents a Marxian-oriented theory of micro-stratification phenomena as an alternative to exchange and expectation states theories. He begins by reviewing the evidence for four empirical generalizations concerning cross-class, status and power interaction which can be extrapolated from Marx's theory of alienation and then presents a theory of interpersonal threat to explain these generalizations and a number of exceptions to them. The theory is shown to have considerable independent empirical support and to be a more plausible explanation for cross-class and formal status interaction in work settings than exchange or expectation states theory. It is at least equally as plausible an explanation for class and formal status inequalities in non-work settings, but is less plausible for informal status structures. That class and formal status-based inequalities generalize beyond the work place supports a Marxian rather than a Pluralist model, but as yet there is little evidence that class consistently takes precedence over occupational, racial or ethnic status.

Kalleberg	American Sociological Review	47	3	1982-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 307-324	American Sociological Association	fla		Printers have long been considered the epitome of the skilled blue-collar craftsmen. The complexity and variety of the work process, the state of technology in the industry, and the role of strong unions in maintaining shop floor autonomy have been important factors in preserving high levels of skill, and thus power, among printers. Recently, however, all this has been changing. The steady decline of industrial profit margins after World War II has led many large printing establishments to introduce more sophisticated printing technologies, particularly computerized typesetting processes, which have routinized work tasks and led to a decline of skill among printing craftsmen. In this paper, we provide substantive and empirical evidence for these processes with a time-series analysis of data from the printing industry for the years 1931-1978. We find support for our theory of industrial transformation. Specifically, our data suggest that skill levels in the industry have indeed declined and, moreover, that these declines are largely due to the shift to more capital-intensive printing techniques. Our arguments also support the view that social relations of production between employers and employees influence the nature of technology utilized in an industry.

Summary measures concerning the net turnover, transition probabilities and continuous time transition rates permit an analysis of the overall process of change from a point in time prior to the start of formal socialization all the way to the end of year six when formal socialization ends. Findings show that the process of socialization with respect to the People component is characterized by ambivalence which is expressed in almost balanced positive and negative cross pressures concerning the importance of this component in the role of the competent physician. The process of change with respect to the Status component is an absorbing Markov chain: change is in a positive direction and occurs rather quickly so that by the end of year three virtually all of the population has moved to a positive position on this component and practically no change is evident during subsequent years. With respect to the Science component the data show that pressures are consistently and dominantly negative during the entire process with few counter pressures in a positive direction.

The need for strong assumptions about temporal patterning, which the theories do not supply, is probably responsible for these findings. A statistical technique which permits a more flexible approach to temporal analysis is described and applied to data on crime and police strength in Detroit. We find no evidence for the systematic relationships envisioned in economic theory and attribute this to important organizational and political variables which are omitted from these theories.

Ultimate national purposes require not only their worshipers, but also their enemies. When these sacred forces penetrate daily reality, then their opposites-subversives-will also appear in daily institutional life. The corporateness of societies, as expressed in their political system, is theoretically linked to the penetration of transcendent reality into daily life, and a witch-hunting dispersion index is proposed to measure the extent to which subversion is ritually discovered throughout a society's social institutions. The overall rate of witch hunting is also measured. Data on rates of political witch hunting between 1950 and 1970 for 39 countries is presented to evaluate the general theoretical argument. The data suggest that as societies politically express more of their corporate national interest they ritually cleanse more institutional areas, as measured by the dispersion index. Along with the representation of the corporate national interest, the overall rate of witch hunting is significantly affected by country size, level of economic development and the relative power of the state. The dispersion of witch hunting, on the other hand, is unaffected by these control variables and seems to be a more purely Durkheimian phenomenon.

Grounded in an extensive study of the practices of worker collectives, this paper seeks to identify some of the structural commonalities which link these new work organizations and to develop a theoretical framework for understanding them. First, the ideal-type features of collectivist democracy are delineated and contrasted with the characteristic features of bureaucracy. The ideal-type approach allows us to assess these organizations not as failures to achieve bureaucratic standards they do not share, but as efforts to realize wholly different values. Second, constraints and social costs that inhibit the realization of organizational democracy are discussed. It is in the conceptualization of alternative forms of organization that organizational theory has been weakest, and it is here that the experimentation of collectives may broaden our understanding.

The theory describes how choices made by individuals (about which goods to value, which social aggregates to form, and what conditions to regard as just or fair for themselves) combine with two objective structural features--the actual distributions of goods and their intercorrelations--to produce the sentiment of justice in the individual. The theory views social relations as a meeting of justice sentiments. Hence, a social aggregate is characterized by the distribution of justice sentiments experienced by its members; and the social aggregate's characteristic social facts are approximated by the parameters of the distribution of justice sentiments, such parameters as the proportion who feel unjustly underrewarded, the Gini's mean difference, the lower extreme value, the overall mean, and many others. By holding constant both the goods of value to the members of a social aggregate and the condition regarded by them as just or fair, it becomes possible to generate expected distributions of justice sentiments from knowledge of the actual distributions of goods, thereby enhancing the usefulness of the theory. In this paper, using three hypothetical distributions of goods (Rectangular, Pareto, and Lognormal), we generate the corresponding expected justice distributions--one negatively skewed Exponential, a family of positively skewed Exponentials, and a family of Normals--and evaluate many parameters of interest.

Data in this study show that these trends for white women have continued from 1972 to 1975 and that the levels of egalitarianism and attitude consistency attained in 1975 were maintained through 1978. White men exhibited as much change in the egalitarian direction as did white women between 1972 and 1978; by 1978, white men's sex-role attitudes resembled those of white women. White men's sex-role attitudes also became more consistent between 1972 and 1975. Changes in sex-role attitude consistency for whites could not be accounted for by changes in liberal-conservative political attitudes. Black men's and women's sex-role attitudes showed no significant changes between 1972 and 1978; however, small sample size precluded detailed analyses of these trends.

This is because core investors are prejudiced against investing in peripheral areas. To test this theory, one industry, Victorian railways, was selected. An econometric model of county railway mileage was constructed to represent the expected location of railways under a regime of market rationality. The residuals from the model were then examined to see if peripheral areas receive disproportionately smaller railway nets. The findings suggest that at best there is a very small peripheral handicap that is confounded with the effects of terrain. Overall, a simple economic model is not substantially improved upon by the inclusion of cultural differentiation. A plea is made for alternative specifications of the mechanisms of internal colonialism.

Formalization of the analysis concludes that when most families consist of male-female pairs (with or without children), when mating is voluntary, when the number of skills needed for successful family maintenance is large and when most people are capable of acquiring the skills, the utility of ascription is maximal. However, when there is some scarcity of inherent aptitude and when societies are capable of identifying those individuals with aptitude, the functionality of ascription diminishes, and ascription eventually becomes dysfunctional. It is argued that the latter set of conditions are precisely those which tend to characterize modern industrial societies.

Starnes	American Sociological Review	42	4	1977-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 599-611	American Sociological Association	fla		Research on subjective class identification has tended to use the same single-item measure of this construct without regard to its validity and reliability. To address these and related measurement issues, multiple indicators of subjective class are analyzed within the framework of a path analytic model with unobservable variables. Measures of objective "class" and political alienation are also included in the construction of an overidentified model, and Joreskog's procedure for the analysis of covariance structures is used to find an acceptable fit to the data. Final models for black and white subsamples support the assumption of unidimensionality which underlies previous measures of subjective class identification. Validity and reliability estimates are given for various indicators, including the conventional measure. Also, advantages of the multiple indicators approach are demonstrated by comparing regressions of the standard, single-item measure and a composite measure of subjective class on education, occupational status, and income.

An analysis of historical changes in inequalities in the odds of persons progressing from given forms of schooling to others indicates the consequences of these shifting policies, and the process through which the overall disparities in schooling changed. As in the United States (Mare, 1981) and Britain (Halsey et al., 1980), the overall odds of everyone completing the lowest progressions increased, pushing everyone up to the higher schooling progressions, where socioeconomic differentials are generally smaller; however, in contrast to the case in the U.S. and Britain, socioeconomic differentials in the odds of given progressions did not increase across cohorts. In fact, for the progression to completion of primary education, such differentials declined. Differentials based on gender showed large cross-cohort decreases, but changes in the effects of place of residence were modest. These changes in Hungary appear to demonstrate the effectiveness of both the elimination of a class-based dual structure of primary education and administrative control over the process of social selection as a means of substantially reducing socioeconomic inequalities in the allocation of schooling.

Stolzenberg	American Sociological Review	40	5	1975-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 645-665	American Sociological Association	fla		A key problem in sociology, as in economics, is explaining why some workers earn more money than others. Sociological models of earnings have stressed the role of a worker's occupation and have tended to ignore the conditions of the labor market in which he finds work. Economic models have stressed labor market functioning at the expense of considering the role of a worker's occupation in determining his wages. In this paper, I attempt to combine sociological models of earnings with (a) economic models of earnings and (b) concepts and findings from the sociology of occupations and professions. I argue theoretically and empirically that some similar conclusions about the processes governing individual earnings attainment can be drawn by examining occupations in terms of labor markets and by analysis of labor markets from the standpoint of occupations. These conclusions are: (a) that labor markets tend to be fragmented along occupational lines, (b) that the processes governing wage attainment vary from one occupation to another and (c) that occupational differences in these processes can be predicted from and explained in terms of the forces which lead to occupational segmentation of labor markets. I discuss some useful implications of my analyses for the study of the relationship between worker age and worker earnings, and I perform some empirical and theoretical analyses of occupational differences in the age-wage relationship. Data are drawn from the U.S. Censuses of 1960 and 1970 and from publications of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Theoretical considerations suggest that political liberty and popular sovereignty are distinct dimensions, but our confirmatory factor analysis reveals that they are not empirically separable.

Berk	American Sociological Review	49	2	1984-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 261-272	American Sociological Association	fla		The specific deterrence doctrine and labeling theory predict opposite effects of punishment on individual rates of deviance. The limited cross-sectional evidence available on the question is inconsistent, and experimental evidence has been lacking. The Police Foundation and the Minneapolis Police Department tested these hypotheses in a field experiment on domestic violence. Three police responses to simple assault were randomly assigned to legally eligible suspects: an arrest; "advice" (including, in some cases, informal mediation); and an order to the suspect to leave for eight hours. The behavior of the suspect was tracked for six months after the police intervention, with both official data and victim reports. The official recidivism measures show that the arrested suspects manifested significantly less subsequent violence than those who were ordered to leave. The victim report data show that the arrested subjects manifested significantly less subsequent violence than those who were advised. The findings falsify a deviance amplification model of labeling theory beyond initial labeling, and fail to falsify the specific deterrence prediction for a group of offenders with a high percentage of prior histories of both domestic violence and other kinds of crime.

But local activists often say: "I did it because nobody else would." Investigation of the differences among 1456 Detroit residents who were nonmembers, token members, or active members (either currently active or past leaders) of their neighborhood associations reveals that active members were significantly more pessimistic than token members about the prospects for neighborhood collective action, a finding explained by recent theoretical work on collective action by Oliver et al. (1984). Other findings are that active members are more highly educated than token members; that past leaders know more people and have higher interest in local problems; and that currently active members have more close ties in the neighborhood, like the neighborhood less, and are less likely to be homeowners. Contrasts between members and nonmembers are similar to those found in previous research.

Parcel	American Sociological Review	44	2	1979-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 262-279	American Sociological Association	fla		Despite continued interest in racial inequality, studies which effectively integrate structural and socialization/investment explanations of racial differences remain rare. In this paper arguments are presented for using contextual analysis to study individual labor earnings as a function of both background/investment variables and specific dimensions of areal labor market social and economic organization. Analysis from samples of workers (821 whites, 375 blacks) suggests that, in the presence of numerous controls (1) black earnings levels are hindered by racial competition and residential segregation, and facilitated by export sector productivity; and (2) white earnings levels also are hindered by residential segregation, but facilitated by racial competition and export sector productivity. Implications of these findings are explored with regression standardization which suggests that policy seeking to promote racial economic equality must recognize that changes in the racial distribution of resources would not occur independently of changes in the rates of return to resources.

Controls for other media use, other exposure to Canada, and various socioeconomic dimensions were employed. Substantial cognitive and attitudinal effects were found. Cognitive effects were generally stronger than attitudinal effects, and cognitive and attitudinal effects toward sending country were stronger than toward receiving country. The pattern of effects differed somewhat in the adult and student samples.

The final report compares the last period, 1850-1865, with previous periods and includes a new discussion of family conflict in magazine content. It is suggested that the period 1850-1865 may have been a period of significant family change. The theoretical synthesis of findings for the 1741-1865 period is presented. Significant variables include the family as a change agent and the role of ideology and developmental factors (i.e., urbanization and industrialization). Some observations on causal relationships are made and basic limitations in the use of literary sources of data are noted.

The concept of the ecological niche is quantified explicitly in a way which ties together geography, time, and the social composition of organizations. A differential equation model analogous to the Lotka-Volterra competition equations in biology captures the dynamics of the system. This dynamic model is related to the niche concept in a novel way, which produces an easily understood and powerful picture of the static and dynamic structure of the community. This new perspective provides a theoretical link between the aggregate macrostructural theory of Blau (1977a,b) and the microstructural dynamics of organizational demography (Pfeffer, 1983). The model is tested with data on organizations from a midwestern city.

Ambivalence is argued to be a necessary component of normative explanations which contemplate only constraining norms, as exemplified also in the place of ambivalence in Parsons' theory of deviance. Although ambivalence refers broadly to the individual's experience of conflicting norms, its psychotherapeutic origins in analyzing special kinds of relationship give it connotations of continuity in time and of excitation and potential explosiveness. It is these connotations which give ambivalence the appearance of providing an explanation of the origin and maintenance of deviance. Although sociologists have treated ambivalence as a property of the individual mind, possible meanings of ambivalence seated at aggregate levels are explored. The use of ambivalence as an explanatory concept should be replaced by analysis in terms of the conflicting norms and values the concept purports to cover.

A status attainment perspective from the sociology of education was used to conceptualize tracking influences on delinquency suggested by delinquency theories, and path models were employed to explore various assumptions about the development of delinquency. The results did not support the findings of earlier cross-sectional and correlational research that noncollege track placement would lower self-esteem and cause delinquency. Controlling for background, ability, school attachment, self-esteem, and educational and occupational aspirations, delinquency in the senior year of high school and one year after graduation were best predicted by sophomore levels of delinquency. These results suggest that school socialization experiences occurring earlier than high school be searched for causes of delinquency among boys.

First, differences in the frequencies of triad types representing exclusive and nonexclusive dyadic friendships are compared. As expected, girls are found to have a greater frequency of exclusive triads than boys while boys are found to have a higher percentage of nonexclusive triads than girls. Girls are also shown to have a higher frequency of exclusive than comparable nonexclusive triads while no such pattern exists for boys. A second analysis examines movement across triad types over time; it shows that girls tend to return to an isolated dyad while boys tend to expand their dyadic friendships to include a third person. The implications of these results for differential learning of social skills and for the experience of newcomers to a group are discussed.

Spilerman, I, and numerous other researchers on conflict, have relied on data which closer inspection reveals to have been wire service reports in different guises. Results derived from this data without taking the pattern of wire service reporting into account, may be spurious. This paper addresses itself to the question of what, if any part, of the reports of conflict appearing in newspapers may be accepted as valid data. Some mechanisms reducing distortion are identified. Types of facts more or less subject to bias are distinguished. Finally, a statistical analysis indicates that a lack of conflict reports may not mean that conflict has not occurred. However, if a sample is limited in the manner to be specified, then the fact that no conflict is reported may be accepted as valid.

Kasarda	American Sociological Review	46	5	1981-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 600-615	American Sociological Association	fla		Building upon community and organizational theory, we assess how three key components of community structure--managerial, clerical, and professional and technical support--respond to population size, growth, and decline. The units are 1,395 relatively autonomous U.S. nonmetropolitan cities. For places that grew between 1960 and 1970, our hypotheses were confirmed that a positive association exists between both population size and growth and the proportion of employed in professional and clerical occupations. A negative association for the managerial component is consistent with findings in organizational research. Smaller but similar associations were generally found for declining places. Status of communities as administrative centers and population change in their hinterlands are introduced as additional variables. Alternative longitudinal models yield consistent results: structural changes tend to be symmetrical across growing and declining communities, but they are less responsive to demographic contraction than expansion.

It is shown that previous attempts to test this hypothesis neglected a number of relevant variables. A more thorough test is made which attempts to include all of the relevant variables more or less simultaneously. It is concluded that the error that may result from the arbitrary assignment of equal distance scoring to ordinal variables is greater than has been previously reported. The main reason why the present test of the little error hypothesis reaches a conclusion at variance with previous tests is that they considered only extreme correlations with an outside variable--either perfect or very low.

All orientations but the one locally called "scientific" are to be taken to be distortions. Its hegemony involves chiefly fidelity to a label, to an associated rhetoric and to a network of persons. Individuals and groups put sociologies together in the context of the competition and conflict of interest groups within which they live and work. This diversity of sociologies presents disparate definitions of terms, contrasting methodologies and assorted theories that may or may not appear to deal with the same genus homo sapiens considered socially. Sociologists need to comprehend the significance of contrasts among sociologies and perceive their own relationships to the major conflicts over "sociological turf." We have not yet learned enough about how to permit the growth of necessary institutionalization of our discipline without diminishing opportunities for creative dissent. Steps to cope with this situation are outlined.

The academic track is selective on the basis of scholastic aptitude and prepares students for higher education. The vocational tracks maintain low curricular requirements and are said to enhance educational attainment of low-aptitude students. Ethnicity is highly correlated with measured aptitude. Hence, Sephardim are typically assigned to vocational tracks whereas Ashkenazim are more likely to attend the academic track. The investigation concerns the extent to which tracking reinforces the effects of ethnic aptitude differences on ethnic inequalities in educational attainment. An analysis of data on educational histories for a subsample of Jewish men reveals that educational persistence at the secondary level is virtually unaffected by track placement. Academic track placement enhances eligibility for higher education of all but the least able students. The availability of the vocational track does not enhance educational participation of Sephardim. Rather, it inhibits further their already low likelihood of receiving higher education.

Nelsen	American Sociological Review	46	5	1981-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 632-640	American Sociological Association	fla		Three contexts that affect religious socialization are discussed: denominational structure (church and sect vis-a-vis their environments), time (the religious climates of the 1950s and the present), and family processes (gender role and birth order). Data from 3,000 Minnesota youths aged 10-14 show that religious apostasy occurs more in the liberal, mainline Protestant denominations than among conservative bodies and that religious conformity is exhibited more by females and firstborn males. The interaction effects among gender, birth order, and denomination in predicting religiosity testify to the importance of considering contextual effects in religious socialization.

These are: the developmental perspective, which treats ethnicity as a persistent primordial sentiment; the reactive ethnicity perspective, according to which ethnic mobilization may result from a cultural division of labor; and the ethnic competition perspective, in which ethnic mobilization is seen as an outgrowth of the increased competition between groups over roles and resources. In the Welsh case, available historical evidence lends some support to each of these perspectives. To adjudicate between them, we analyze historical census and election data on Welsh counties. This analysis supports the ethnic competition perspective, though some support is found for the developmental perspective.

Weitzel-O'Neill	American Sociological Review	42	1	1977-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 91-105	American Sociological Association	fla		In the past, sociologists have proposed that men and women approach situations in which they have to work with other people differently; that men are "task" or "instrumental" specialists, while women are "social" or "expressive" specialists. Subsequent advances in research on the social psychology of small groups, on families, and on personality has largely removed the theoretical and empirical supports for this proposition. On the other hand, researchers continue to observe sex differences in behavior in a variety of task-oriented situations. This paper suggests that sex roles may be seen as the result of status processes. Since men have higher status than women, men are expected to be more competent than women and it is expected that competitive or dominating behavior is legitimate for men but not for women. Empirical studies of sex roles as related to task appropriateness, group problem solving, conflict, dominating behavior and role expectations are reviewed in support of this theory.

This study investigates the cultural and institutional history of the Gallant and interprets his social meaning. The Gallant was a manifestation of a dramatically powerful archetype, the Trickster, whose characteristics had been developed in the Devil and Vice of earlier dramatic genres. Unlike these previous characters, the Gallant was portrayed as successful and integrated into the elite. For the young men attending the private theatres where the Gallant appeared, a cultural model was provided to reconcile their social status with their economic pursuits.

The quality of the public's perception of Washington at this time is documented mainly through public addresses and accounts in the colonial press. By the end of the Revolutionary War, however, Washington had been transformed from a military hero into the new republic's great moral symbol. This transformation is studied by looking at Washington's wartime conduct in light of a political culture that fostered intense suspicion of all forms of power and a belief in "virtue" as an antidote for man's innate corruptibility. Refusing time and again to convert his military prestige into political power, Washington personified the heroic archetype of the Anglo-American Whig tradition. This conclusion is documented by an analysis of eulogies delivered on the occasion of Washington's death. In these eulogies we find the very antithesis of Max Weber's formulation of charismatic leadership. Since charisma theory is applicable to only one type of heroic leader, namely, the gifted authoritarian who seeks radical change, an alternative conception, applicable to hero worship in the conservative republican tradition, is presented.

His theory is described, and four analytical dimensions are identified which provide the basis for discussing that relevance. Several standard areas of sociological endeavor are briefly analyzed in terms of those dimensions, and then a detailed analysis of community power relations is provided in light of his theory. It is concluded that Mead's theory of temporality is a powerful framework for organizing an array of sociological interests and problems.

Zerubavel has investigated social solidarity as it is created through the macrosocial temporal symmetry of social relations. The research reported herein is a quantitative microsocial analysis of temporal symmetry manifested in conversation. In a group of eleven tape-recorded dyadic conversations, where the actual conversation partners have been separated and then scrambled together, a set of computer routines is capable of rematching a digitized version of the actual conversation partners through an analysis of voice frequency levels. In addition, the adaptation of partners to one another varies as the conversation proceeds. The temporal symmetry of a microsocial event is thus demonstrated quantitatively.

Home ownership by parents increases the probability of a child's home ownership. Parents' income is positively associated with the value of children's homes among owners, though it has no effect on probability of ownership. The effect of parents' income on home value is mediated by the level of gifts among black households and by parents' home value among whites. It is argued that gifts may measure direct aid and parental home value may measure a young person's expectations concerning appropriate housing standards. Data are from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics.

Given a political system vulnerable to challenge and strong internal organization the main challenge confronting insurgents is a preeminently tactical one. Lacking institutionalized power, challengers must devise protest techniques that offset their powerlessness. This is referred to as a process of tactical innovation. Such innovations, however, only temporarily afford challengers increased bargaining leverage. In chess-like fashion, movement opponents can be expected, through effective tactical adaptation, to neutralize the new tactic, thereby reinstituting the power disparity between themselves and the challenger. This perspective is applied to the development of the black movement over the period, 1955-1970. Evidence derived from content-coding all relevant story synopses contained in The New York Times Index for these years is presented showing a strong correspondence between the introduction of new protest techniques and peaks in movement activity. Conversely, lulls in black insurgency reflect the successful efforts of movement opponents to devise effective tactical counters to these innovations.

Using a nationally representative sample the effects of age, sex, marital disruption, socioeconomic status, race, and other potentially confounding variables, unincorporated in other studies, are controlled. The results suggest that (a) the inverse relation between sibship size and IQ lessens for the economically advantaged, (b) the only child breaks the otherwise consistent linear decline between sibship size and IQ in the below-poverty condition only, (c) the nonteacher handicap for only children is questionable, and (d) close spacing, as Zajonc defines it, may have detrimental consequences for children irrespective of birth order.

Three components of the polity--decentralization, communication, and total influence--are analyzed for their impact on members of 32 noneconomic voluntary associations in Indianapolis. Using a contextual-effects model, communication and participation in decisions are found to increase commitment and to reduce detachment net of other organizational and individual factors. An interaction between communication and decision participation suggests that communication can compensate for lack of direct involvement in making decisions in strengthening member support for the collectivity.

Stolzenberg	American Sociological Review	41	2	1976-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 235-252	American Sociological Association	fla		The relationship between women's fertility and labor force participation plans has commanded much attention recently. Some analysts have argued that women reduce their desired fertility in order to accommodate their desires for labor force participation; others have suggested that women's plans for labor force participation are modified to accommodate their expected fertility; still others have argued that women's fertility expectations and labor force participation plans both affect each other simultaneously; and at least one analyst has suggested that the commonly observed inverse relationship between women's childbearing and labor force activity is spurious and is caused by common antecedents of both variables. In this paper, we investigate these and other related hypotheses by examining simultaneous equation models of young women's fertility expectations and plans for future labor force participation (i.e., plans for labor force participation when they are 35 years old). Our analyses are based on a large national sample of women in their mid twenties (n = 3589 after deletion of cases with missing data). We find that the number of children a woman plans to bear has only a small effect on the probability that she plans to participate in the labor force when she is 35 years old. However, we find that a woman's plans to participate in the labor force when she is 35 have a substantial effect on the total number of children she plans to bear in her lifetime. We find this relationship for presently married and for never-married women. We also find the same relationship for married women when their husbands' income and their husbands' attitudes toward their labor force participation are included in the model. We discuss the methodological implications of our findings for other studies of women's fertility and labor force activity.

The theory is applied to issues of social development. Materialistic values are predicted for poor and developing societies and interpersonal satisfaction values are predicted for industrialized societies. The theory also predicts that norms of equality and solidarity are more likely to develop in societies with simple class structures and norms of proportionality are more likely to develop with increasing structural complexity. Data from a study of Mexican and U. S. parents and their children are presented to support hypotheses drawn from the theory. Some of the criticisms of exchange theory as a basis for explaining the formation of social norms are examined and the utility of the theory's underlying individualistic and utilitarian assumptions are explored and defended.

The impact of racial discrimination is measured by the percentage of the population of third world origin in each state and by the ratio of black to white male earnings for those who work full time. White gain is measured by the level of white male earnings in each state and the Gini coefficient of earnings inequality among white males. If whites gain economically from racism, we would expect to find that the greater the percentage of the population of a state that is third world and the lower the ratio of black/white earnings then the higher the level of white earnings and the less the inequality in white earnings. The basic relationships were examined controlling for percentage of the population that is urban, percentage of the economically active population in manufacturing, level of personal income, region and percentage of the population that is third world. It is found that whites do not gain from economic discrimination; on the contrary, white working people actually lose economically from such discrimination. It is argued that racism is a divisive force which undermines the economic and political strength of working people and acts to worsen the economic position of white workers in the most racist areas. In support of this interpretation, data on the strength of unions is examined.

Gove, Michael Hughes	American Sociological Review	44	1	1979-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 126-146	American Sociological Association	fla		For the past fifty years it has been consistently reported that men have higher rates of mortality, while women have higher rates of morbidity. The higher rates of mortality for males can be largely explained by the fact that they have higher rates for the chronic diseases which are the leading causes of death. The explanation of why women have higher rates of morbidity, however, remains unanswered. Recent literature suggests three possible explanations: (1) a greater willingness among women as compared with men to report they are ill and/or to react overtly to an illness, (2) the greater ability of women to adopt the sick role due to their lack of obligations, and (3) the possibility that the reported differences reflect real sex differences in illness. This paper evaluates these explanations and provides support for the view that the sex differences in morbidity are real. The data analyzed show that when one controls for marital status, living arrangements, psychiatric symptoms, and nurturant role obligations, the health differences between men and women disappear.

Data from a sample of persons arrested for murder suggest that the stereotype of the violent offender, the "normal primitive," constitutes an official imagery within which legal decisions are made. Path analytic techniques indicate that conformity to the criminal conception, along with the social class of the defendant, has significant consequences for the assignment of public counsel, denial of bail and a plea of guilt before the judge. Lack of access to legal resources, in turn, produces the more severe convictions awarded by the court.

Data from the main experiment (that in the first relay assembly test room at Western Electric) are interpreted statistically for the first time. Quantitative analysis of this quasi experiment is accomplished by time-series multiple regression using nearly five years of data. This analysis demonstrates that experimental variables account for some 90% of the variance in quantity and quality of output, both for the group and for individual workers. Imposition of managerial discipline, economic adversity, and quality of raw materials provide most explanation, obviating the need to draw upon less clearly definable human relations mechanisms. For decades the Hawthorne studies have provided a rationale for humane approaches in the organization of work by suggesting that considerate or participative treatment of workers led to better economic performance. The present analysis suggests, to the contrary, that humanitarian procedures must provide their own justification.

Several subsequent papers have built on this finding and have suggested that publicized suicide stories trigger increases in covert suicides disguised as motor vehicle or airplane accidents. If the original ASR findings cannot be replicated, then doubt is cast on all these studies. In this paper we demonstrate that U.S. daily suicides increase significantly after highly publicized suicide stories appear on television evening news programs. We provide the first evidence that the increase in suicides occurs only after and not before the suicide story. In addition, we provide the first systematic study of the length of time a suicide story affects suicides; the effect probably does not extend beyond ten days. These findings support and extend the literature on imitative suicides.

The spread of the sit-ins followed the networks of these pre-existing institutional relationships. Factors internal to the black community-churches, colleges, protest organizations, and leaders--were responsible for nurturing and developing the movement. The analysis is based on primary data collected from archives and interviews with civil rights leaders.

Findings are based on all 21-64 year-old first admissions to all state mental hospitals in Tennessee between 1956 and 1965.

The analysis also supports two interaction hypotheses, namely, that the effect of status resources varies depending on psychiatric status and level of behavioral deviance.

McClendon	American Sociological Review	41	1	1976-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 52-64	American Sociological Association	fla		The NORC General Social Surveys of 1972-1974 are utilized to compare white working males and females with respect to the process of occupational status attainment. The occupational status of each sex is quite similar, although males are somewhat more likely to have high and low status jobs. The process of status attainment is also the same for males and females. Education is the strongest determinant of status for each sex, with family background characteristics showing only a small direct influence on status. The determinants of educational attainment are also much the same for white working males and females, although number of siblings has a significantly stronger effect for males. There is no evidence that the education of the like-sexed parent is a stronger influence on educational attainment than that of the opposite-sexed parent. An extended model of occupational status attainment is also estimated for females. Although full-time workers and married women have slightly higher status than part-time workers and unmarried women, respectively, the number of children at home has no effect on the occupational status of working women.

Georgia successfully eliminate racial disparities in capital cases. Over 600 homicide indictments in twenty Florida counties in 1976 and 1977 were examined, focusing on homicides between strangers (nonprimary homicides). Those accused of murdering whites are more likely to be sentenced to death than those accused of murdering blacks. This trend is due primarily to the higher probability for those accused of murdering whites to be indicted for first degree murder. When controlling for race of the victim, the data do not clearly support the hypothesis that race of the defendant is strongly associated with the probability of a first degree murder indictment or the imposition of the death penalty.

The rare empirical evidence in support of this hypothesis is inconclusive because the variables and the designs used are defective. A diachronic multiple regression test using a new version of the theoretical independent variable also fails to provide support for the hypothesis. The test suggests that internal processes play a role that should not be ignored in the economic growth of nation-states.

The current analysis suggests that this debate has been incorrectly posed. Both companies and industries represent meaningful units of analysis that embody consequences for economic segmentation. The most important company characteristic in the wage determination process is found to be plant employment size. The most important industrial characteristic is found to be level of capital usage. Company- and industry-level sectoral measures are also compared and evaluated. These sectoral measures are associated only to a moderate degree and have distinct consequences for labor force outcomes. Together, these findings suggest distinct roles for company and industrial models of economic segmentation. The paper concludes with the argument that companies and industries represent distinct levels of economic segmentation, each of which deserves conceptualization in its own right.

After certain of the notions that underlie each of them are made clear, the contrasting positions of these two approaches are reviewed with respect to common issues, including the nature of the self, the place of meanings and subjectivity in analysis, and what are appropriate research methods. These considerations provide the basis for a general interpretation of Goffman's work, something the sociological literature has lacked. Though Goffman is most often treated as a symbolic interactionist, this paper argues that a better understanding of his work results from reading it as a version of contemporary structuralism. The fundamental ways in which his structuralism is distinct from the cultural (as well as the interactionist) approach also are given.

Gibbs	American Sociological Review	47	2	1982-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 227-237	American Sociological Association	fla		Consistent with the theory, there is a substantial inverse relation among age groups of U.S. white women between the official suicide rate and a simultaneous measure of three dimensions of status integration (marital, parental, and labor force). Further analysis indicates that the present test and all previous tests underestimate the theory's predictive accuracy. The underestimation stems from incomplete tests, in which several dimensions of status integration are ignored; and only one procedure appears appropriate for the measurement of two or more dimensions considered together. When the three status families--marital, parental, and labor force--are cross-classified, the resulting simultaneous measure of integration explains four times as much variance in the suicide rate as does any of the three considered separately and nearly twice that explained by any version of various composite measures (e.g., simple addition of the three component measures).

It is argued that variations in the organization of production lead to differences in the occupational composition of industrial sectors which produces differential impacts on the distribution of income. Empirical analysis shows that changes in Concentrated Sector employment have the greatest equalizing effect on the distribution of income. Changes in Competitive Sector employment contribute more to changes in the proportion of families at the lower end of the distribution, while changes in State Sector employment have more effect on the proportion at the upper end. Some implications of these findings are discussed.

This paper is a case study of a single (new) occupation within a single (old) industry--longshore crane operators--using aspects of all these theories. It argues that because the labor market is the arena of negotiation between firms and workers, analysis should focus on both labor market outcomes and labor market formation. In this case the labor market outcome has been the fragmentation of the occupation into two labor markets, the one providing workers an advantaged status, the other providing workers a disadvantaged status. This is related to technological changes in the industry, and to the conflict among employer goals, union principles, and individual worker interests.

Preliminary to addressing this question, consideration is given to the manner of measuring severity and to the volatile components of this phenomenon. With respect to the latter, it is found that (1) disorder severity declined as a function of the number of prior outbreaks in a city and (2) there is evidence for a temporal effect, with the post-Martin Luther King-assassination disturbances having been unusually destructive. Regarding the more stable (community) determinants of disorder severity, only Negro population size and a dummy term for South were found to be related to severity. Net of these variables, various indicators of Negro disadvantage in a community failed to reveal significant associations with severity. This result is interpreted as further evidence for the distinctly national character of the disturbances in the 1960s.

At one end of the axis are those business people who are primary owners or top managers of several major corporations, collectively labeled the inner group, while at the other end are those who are connected with only a single major corporation. It is reasoned that, by virtue of their multiple corporate connections and the resulting transcendence of parochial corporate interests, inner group members would be more often involved in the governance of other institutions than would be other members of the business elite. Institutional governance includes the occupancy of top administrative posts and governing and advisory board positions of three types of institutions: nonprofit, nongovernment organizations, such as economic development and cultural organizations; local, state, and federal agencies; and major business policy associations. Drawing on a set of 2,003 directors of the nation's largest 797 corporations in 1969, and on director biographical information acquired from several sources, this study found that inner group members are substantially more likely, compared with other members of the business elite, to be involved directly in the governance of a range of institutions. Moreover, available evidence also indicates that the higher participation rate of inner group members is at least partly a result of their capacity to mobilize greater corporate resources and their involvement in a common, transcorporate social network. The evidence presented tentatively supports the thesis that the American business elite is differentiated along an inner group axis, at least with respect to the selection of business people to assist in the governance of other institutions. The inner group may be an important source of political leadership capable of promoting the more general interests of the entire capitalist class.

Here and in the original, the focus is on parental values for children, especially on the component of "self-direction versus conformity." The results indicate that (1) there have been sizable trends in the value of self-direction since Kohn's original survey; (2) while social class remains the primary determinant of self-direction values, as Kohn argues, the explanatory power of a "parental values" model is significantly increased through the inclusion of non-class variables; (3) the overall social class effect is apparently due more to educational attainment than occupational prestige. Some implications of these findings for subsequent research are also discussed.

In the USSR increasing urbanization is not correlated with higher rates of criminality. As a result of the internal passport system and the difficulties of moving to large cities, the rates of criminality in the Soviet Union have shifted from the most populous cities of the USSR to the newly established cities of the far eastern and far northern parts of the USSR and to the rapidly expanding smaller urban centers.

Most of the items examined were suggested by federal district court judges and were drawn from presentence investigation reports. The sample provided enough variation in social status to allow testing of hypotheses about the relation of sentencing to social class background. The results indicate that sentencing is more predictable than some recent accounts would suggest. Important correlates of the decision to incarcerate reflect a) the seriousness of the criminal act, b) the character of the criminal actor, c) the statutory category of violation, and d) such other variables as the sex and age of the defendant and the district of conviction. A different model is necessary to explain differences in length of incarceration. The chief finding with respect to social class is that the probability of imprisonment rises with the occupational status of the defendant. Various interpretations of the findings are suggested and assessed.

Classes in this research are not defined in terms of categories of occupations, but in terms of social relations of control over investments, decision making, other people's work, and one's own work. Data on these dimensions of social relations of production were gathered in a national survey of the U.S. working population. Four general results from the study are particularly important: (1) The working class is by far the largest class in the American class structure. (2) Close to half of all locations within the class structure have a "contradictory character," that is, their class content is determined by more than one basic class. The American class structure cannot therefore be represented by any simple scheme of class polarization. (3) Lower status white-collar occupations are virtually as proletarianized as manual occupations. It therefore makes little sense to consider such occupations as part of the "middle class." (4) Women and blacks are considerably more proletarianized than white males. The result is that a sizable majority of the U.S. working class is composed of women and minorities.

A nonlinear differential equation model based on ecological theory is advanced to explain these differences. The model is tested empirically, including an analysis of local stability.

Women are found to have greater mobility through marriage, both upward and downward, than men do through occupations, and women more readily cross the boundaries among the major status groupings of white-collar, blue-collar and farm. Men, on the other hand, are more likely to "inherit" their fathers' statuses and there is greater association between the statuses of fathers and sons than between the statuses of fathers and daughters. An analysis for historical trends in the data indicates little evidence for either increasing fluidity or rigidity in the mobility system of either sex.

Data were gathered from state building and revitalization movements in four Native American societies during the 1795-1860 period. The findings indicate that given the conditions of economic and/or political deprivation that led to widespread perceptions of social deprivation, less structurally differentiated societies responded with revitalization movements, while more structurally differentiated societies responded with increased differentiation in sub-macro political and economic institutions. This finding suggests that the Wallace and Parsons-Smelser deprivation models of social change can be synthesized by specification of level of macrostructural differentiation as a precondition that influences type of societal change. State building could not be explained by deprivation and social structural arguments alone; markets that encourage economic class formation were critical to the state-building argument.

Felmlee	American Sociological Review	47	1	1982-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 142-151	American Sociological Association	fla		This research examines the role of the firm in women's job mobility using a dynamic approach. Rates of women's job to job transitions are analyzed with a multivariate, stochastic model. The data are employment histories derived from the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Women (1968-1973). The results demonstrate the significance and the advantages of firm-internal labor markets in women's employment. First, the process of job mobility differs greatly within and between employers. Voluntary job changes made between employers rely on observable job rewards and general individual resources. Shifts within a firm depend largely on a woman's age and job duration, signifying the importance of seniority and job-specific resources in determining promotions. Second, jobs in firm-internal labor markets offer higher wages and socioeconomic status to women than other jobs.

Cohen, Marcus Felson	American Sociological Review	44	4	1979-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 588-608	American Sociological Association	fla		In this paper we present a "routine activity approach" for analyzing crime rate trends and cycles. Rather than emphasizing the characteristics of offenders, with this approach we concentrate upon the circumstances in which they carry out predatory criminal acts. Most criminal acts require convergence in space and time of likely offenders, suitable targets and the absence of capable guardians against crime. Human ecological theory facilitates an investigation into the way in which social structure produces this convergence, hence allowing illegal activities to feed upon the legal activities of everyday life. In particular, we hypothesize that the dispersion of activities away from households and families increases the opportunity for crime and thus generates higher crime rates. A variety of data is presented in support of the hypothesis, which helps explain crime rate trends in the United States 1947-1974 as a byproduct of changes in such variables as labor force participation and single-adult households.

Philip Morgan, Kiyosi Hirosima	American Sociological Review	48	2	1983-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 269-281	American Sociological Association	fla		Using data from a 1978 study of wives with pre-school-age children, we show that extended residence fits nicely with certain elements of modern Japanese society, offering tangible benefits for both young couples and their parents. Specifically, the incompatibility of the mother role and wage work is greatly reduced by the child care and housework aid parents provide. Consequently, wives in extended households have more children and are more likely to be employed. Moreover, very few respondents living with parents wish a more separate residence. Extended residence is not an anachronism. Rather, it offers an appealing alternative to some of the most modern segments of contemporary Japanese society.

Mason	American Sociological Review	40	2	1975-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 123-147	American Sociological Association	fla		Social scientists and journalistic social commentators have viewed the 1950s as a period of political de-alienation and the 1960s as a period of re-alienation, and have designated a variety of groups as especially alienated in the 1960s--an impatient black population, restive "Middle Americans" and white "ethnics," rebellious youth, etc. Converse (1972) showed that agreement with three of four survey items measuring political alienation declined in the 1950s and rose in the 1960s, and contended that the rise in the 1960s was fairly uniform across the whole population. This paper first analyzes the degree to which there was differential change in the alienation items across demographically defined social aggregates, and finds little. The lack of differential change might suggest to some that these items are poor measures of alienation. To determine whether this impression is correct, the paper next analyzes attitudinal correlates of alienation in 1968, and shows that for two of the items alienation is higher among those whose attitude preferences deviate from the perceived status quo in either a right-wing or, left-wing direction. For these two alienation items, the paper then shows that changes in the distribution of attitudinal correlates of alienation help to explain the rise in alienation between 1964 and 1968. Thus, the rise in political alienation of the 1960s resulted from increasing discontent with policies and events, but this discontent cut across traditional demographic aggregates.

McLeod	American Sociological Review	49	5	1984-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 620-631	American Sociological Association	fla		Past research has shown that the emotional impact of undesirable life events is significantly greater among women than men. This finding has led to speculation that women possess a deficit in coping capacity or in access to social support that renders them pervasively disadvantaged in responding emotionally to problematic situations. We present a different argument in this paper. We hypothesize and then document that women are not pervasively more vulnerable to the effects of undesirable events. A disaggregated analysis of life-event effects shows, further, that female vulnerability is largely confined to "network" events: life events that do not occur to the focal respondent but to someone in his or her social network who is considered important. Further results are presented to argue that this greater vulnerability is due to the greater emotional involvement of women in the lives of those around them. It is demonstrated that this emotional cost of caring is responsible for a substantial part of the overall relationship between sex and distress.

Inconsistent with traditional versions of mass society theory, the importance of locality identification as revealed by the ads has not declined substantially over time; if anything, the evidence indicates a slight increase in identification. Variations in identification among Seattle neighborhoods suggest that social structural features of areas such as their social status and distance from the central business district are strong, enduring determinants of locality naming.

Smith	American Sociological Review	44	1	1979-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 147-161	American Sociological Association	fla		The literature relating community structural characteristics to policy outputs generally has failed to account for communities not considering an issue as a third type of outcome beyond rejection and adoption. It is argued that nonconsidering communities are likely to be very different from both nonadopters which have considered a policy and have subsequently decided to reject it and from those adopting a particular policy. These types should be separated in research on community structure and community outputs. The current research distinguishes between these three outcome types for fluoridation programs and relates these distinctions to the three important community structural characteristics of structural differentiation, community integration and the centralization of authority within municipal governments. The results of the analysis support the hypotheses, showing that both affinities and disaffinities exist between the communities classified by the three-part outcome typology. Rejecters and adopters are shown to be similar in terms of levels of structural differentiation, and can be distinguished from the less differentiated, nonconsidering communities. Conversely, both nonconsiderers and adopters tend to be more highly integrated and exhibit a greater centralization of authority than rejecters.

The emergence of the Marxian perspective and the logic of its premises are reviewed. Using Canadian delinquency legislation as an historical example, it is found that the Marxian perspective assumes a great deal that is unconfirmed (e.g., that this legislation serves the teleologically inferred "basic interests" of an ambiguously identified "ruling class"), asserts other things that are wrong or misleading (that this legislation increased imprisonment, "invented" new categories of youthful misbehavior, created a "specialized labor market" and increased "industrial discipline"), and ignores much that an organizational analysis helps to reveal (that the emergence of probation work as an organizational concern was the prime factor in the development of Canadian delinquency legislation). Implications of these findings are considered.

Frey	American Sociological Review	44	3	1979-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 425-448	American Sociological Association	fla		Although residential "white flight" from large central cities is hardly a new phenomenon, its cumulative adverse impact on the residual population has led policy makers to be wary of instituting programs which will further exacerbate the process. Recent policy debates have evolved over the question of whether white city-to-suburb movement is affected more significantly by racially-motivated causes, or by conditions associated with the general economic and ecological conditions in the city. The present study assesses a number of previously suggested factors related to race, central city decline, and demographic structure as determinants of the white city-to-suburb movement streams in 39 large SMSAs. Treating this stream as a product of two separate mobility stages, this analysis suggests that most factors, both racial and nonracial, affect central city flight less through the decision to move, than through the choice of destination. Fiscal and ecological features of the metropolitan area are demonstrated to be important in the explanation. However, racial effects cannot be dismissed.

A national survey with a 74% return rate (941 priest-informants) yielded usable data on 131 American Catholic dioceses--i.e., 96% of the population as defined. Resignations appeared to derive directly from the following diocesan conditions: percentage of parishes run by religious clergy, regional dominance (i.e., status of dioceses as "province"), percentage Catholic in area population, percentage of diocesan priests engaged full-time in nonparish work, and estimated degree of priest passivity and disillusionment. Indirectly, traditional authority structures, ideological divisions, and the absence of social solidarity also increased the probability of resignations. Resignations appeared to have no immediate feedback effect on episcopal policies. Such findings are in partial accord with other research indicating a deprivation syndrome leading to resignations. But the special salience of facilitating, rather than causative, factors, along with the absence of feedback, strongly suggests that the Catholic church of that era was a lazy monopoly. Such organizations are slow to make essential changes; they allow radical personnel to depart rather than deal with their criticisms.

Reynolds Farley	American Sociological Review	42	2	1977-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 189-208	American Sociological Association	fla		Since the end of the Depression the black population has become urbanized, and black leaders increasingly have stressed civil rights grievances. Federal courts have overturned many segregationist practices, and Congress has enacted encompassing civil rights legislation. The nation's economy expanded rapidly in the 1960s, and economic growth may account for the improvements in the status of blacks registered in that decade. We would anticipate that the improvements of the 1960s would be negated in the recession of the 1970s. Investigation of recent trends in education, employment, occupations, family income and personal earnings shows that gains made in the 1960s did not disappear. Indeed, racial differences attenuated in the lean 1970s just as they did in the prosperous 1960s. The changes of the post-Depression period apparently mean that even during a pervasive recession blacks did not lose the gains they previously experienced. Despite these improvements, racial differences remain large and will not disappear soon.

Ageton	American Sociological Review	45	1	1980-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 95-110	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper addresses the general question of whether or not the satisfactory resolution of the methodological criticisms of self-report research will result in greater consistency between self-reported and official data with respect to the race and class distributions of delinquent behavior. We review the specific methodological criticisms of self-report delinquency (SRD) research; discuss the use of a new SRD measure in a national youth study; compare the race/class findings of this study with previous SRD research and with official arrest data; and examine the epidemiological and theoretical implications of these findings. Both class and race differentials are found in this study. It appears likely that the differences between these findings and those in earlier SRD studies are a result of differences in the specific SRD measures used. Additionally, these findings suggest a logical connection between SRD and official measures, and they provide some insight into the mechanism whereby official data produce more extreme race and class (as well as age and sex) differences than do self-report measures. The results of this study also have implications for previous tests of theoretical propositions which used self-report delinquency data. In short, prior self-report measures may not have been sensitive enough to capture the theoretically important differences in delinquency involvement.

Nolan	American Sociological Review	44	1	1979-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 110-125	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper reports the results of a cross-national study of the relationship between system size and administrative intensity in societies. Predictions that the relative size of government will increase with increases in system size derived from Mayhew and Levinger's (1976a) density of interaction model and consistent with an elaboration of Blau's (1970; 1972) economy of scale theory of administration are tested with data on 70 nations varying in size, population concentration, and general technological development. A nonmonotonic U-shaped relationship is found between population size and the relative size of government, and this relationship continues to be evidenced when general technological development is controlled. But despite the robustness of the nonmonotonic relationship of administrative intensity with system size, measures of urbanization and relative population concentration are shown to be highly and monotonically related to the relative size of the administrative component of nations. Differences between the two analyses and other problems are discussed, but, with minor qualification, results of these two analyses are interpreted as providing support for the Mayhew-Levinger (1976a) and elaborated Blau (1970; 1972) models and predictions.

Scott Long	American Sociological Review	43	6	1978-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 889-908	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper examines the interrelationship between scientific productivity and academic position, two key dimensions of the scientific career. Contrary to the results of most earlier studies, the effect of departmental location on productivity is found to be strong, whereas the effect of productivity on the allocation of positions is found to be weak. Productivity, as indicated by measures of publications and citations, is shown to have an insignificant effect on both the prestige of a scientist's initial academic appointment and on the outcome of institution changes later in the career. Although the relationship between productivity and the prestige of an academic appointment is insignificant at the time a position is obtained, the effect of departmental prestige on productivity increases steadily with time. For those scientists who change institutions, the prestige of the new department significantly affects changes in a scientist's productivity after the move. It is argued that past studies have obtained spurious results due to their failure to employ a longitudinal design. Not only do cross-sectional designs provide misleading results regarding the interrelationship between departmental location and productivity, but they also systematically alter the findings regarding the effects of sponsorship and doctoral training on productivity.

Forty-nine items from the 1972-1980 cumulative NORC General Social Survey were analyzed. The major conclusions are: (1) There is no evidence that these attitudes are affected by "sheer" or "score" occupational mobility, status consistency, or "return on investment" psychology. (2) Prestige stratum of Father's Occupation has no net association with any of the 49 items, but people from farm backgrounds tend to be more conservative as adults. (3) Respondent's occupational stratum has nontrivial associations with about one-third of the items but the magnitudes are small and the associations are concentrated in two clusters, cynicism and job-related topics. (4) Education is clearly the most pervasive net predictor. (5) All in all, the notion of powerful "class cultures" receives little support from these data.

This trend of expansion in time is continuing, especially in urban areas. The hypothesis that night has become the new frontier is supported by the premise that time, like space, can be occupied and is treated so by humans. A set of evidence, including results of several field experiments, show that nighttime social life in urban areas resembles social life on former land frontiers. The research data refers mainly to contemporary Boston and to the U.S. West a century ago.

Little, Christopher P. Sheffield	American Sociological Review	48	6	1983-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 796-808	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper develops the proposition that organized episodes of self-help criminal justice tend to arise as adaptive forms in places and times of sharp social transition-frontiers. Our method is to compare extralegal appendages to the official criminal justice systems of England and America between the mid-eighteenth and late nineteenth centuries. In England during this period, extralegal associations called private prosecution societies emerged as one approach to coping with ineffective criminal law enforcement and making the existing criminal justice system more accessible in the face of a very expensive private prosecution procedure. American crime-control vigilantism of the same time is similar in respect to its rationale, social composition and transitory period of widespread existence. However, the English self-help criminal justice organizations differed from most of their American counterparts by maintaining a strong attachment to the rule of law and rarely, if ever, acting as courts or executing a sentence. We conclude that both varieties of extralegal crime control were a response to the problem of social control on a type of frontier. The comparison also suggests a continuum of crime control strategies dimensioned along their relationship to the official legal system.

Richard Della Fave	American Sociological Review	45	6	1980-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 955-971	American Sociological Association	fla		Stratified social orders are maintained through a wide variety of mechanisms, one being broad-based legitimation of the notion of unequal distribution of primary resources. My attempt to develop a set of propositions provides at least a partial explanation of how such legitimation is generated and maintained. I argue that both conflict and functional theory point, at least implicitly, to the importance of the effect of unequal distribution of resources on the development of the self--constructing my argument through application of Mead's theory of the self to the case of stratification. This application is shown, in turn, to be compatible with several lines of theorizing in social psychology, including equity and status attribution theory. Once basic propositions are developed, I discuss ways in which major social institutions maintain legitimacy through their effect on the self and explore some possible sources of delegitimation.

Hofferth	American Sociological Review	48	4	1983-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 533-545	American Sociological Association	fla		A dynamic, sequential model is proposed to examine the relationship among the socioeconomic causes and consequences of childbearing. Analysis of data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics weakly supports the hypothesis that the factors associated with an additional birth do vary depending on initial family size, with the first birth most affected by current family income and living standards. The hypothesis that the consequences of each additional birth vary depending on initial family size is strongly supported. The strongest consequences are felt by families with no children or only one child initially, and the impact declines with parity. Support for the hypothesis that the outcomes associated with each birth are causal factors at the next decision point in a sequential model could not be found in this analysis. Thus the evidence for the usefulness of such a model is mixed.

The data are on a police work force and its managerial staff. Two of the models are Markovian; the third, a vacancy model. In each model two types of decision-makers are postulated--managers selecting individuals for promotion and workers deciding to stay or leave. Individuals are distinguished by seniority within each grade. The vacancy or labor demand model's predictive capability was consistently better than either Markovian model--for long (10 years) or short (3-5 year) term forecasts.

The research reported here replicates and extends Wright and Perrone's (1977) analysis of class categories and income inequality in the United States in the context of a rapidly industrializing society. The results confirm that Marxist class categories are as consequential as occupational status in explaining income inequality in both advanced and developing capitalist societies. Yet, there are several difficulties in applying this class model to developing economies, so that a substantially modified class model is developed taking the manual-nonmanual distinction and structural marginality as additional major axes of class determination. This new model is superior to Wright's (1976) model in explaining income inequality in Korea. In the final part of the paper, a tentative test of a dependency model of inequality is attempted, with negative results for the predicted hypothesis of the center-periphery sectoral inequality.

As usually stated, the issue is whether this inverse relationship arises from the fact and that low social status leads to disorder symptomatology (referred to as social causation) or a high degree of symptomatology impairs the individual's ability to be upwardly mobile (social selection). Research on this issue is far from definitive, especially for less severe types of symptomatology. The causal question is reformulated here in terms of the possible outcomes of a causal analysis of panel data. Based on data from two studies which each measure SES and psychological disorder symptomatology at multiple points in time, results from estimating a series of panel models incorporating unobserved variable specifications of both SES and disorder favor a social causation interpretation. However, differences in results across samples suggest that some modification of the simple social causation position may be necessary.

But to date there have been few systematic attempts to apply recent insights from organizational theory developed largely within the context of Western organizations to their Japanese counterparts. This paper combines theoretical insights from both Weberian and decision-making traditions within a single model which is then tested with data from forty-four Japanese manufacturing plants. The results indicate that many relationships linking factors such as organizational size and work variability with structure are quite similar to those found in British and American organizations despite the historical and cultural factors which may be unique to Japanese firms.

Reed	American Sociological Review	43	3	1978-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 404-421	American Sociological Association	fla		The paper demonstrates the utility of a demographic perspective for the study of organizational reproduction and change; it develops three propositions for the application of cohort analysis to the study of organizational political economy. An analytic perspective on bureaucratic career systems is developed to help account for the response of the American Foreign Service and its elite Officer Corps to the major changes in the international environment during and after World War II. First, organizational lag is traced to the difficulty of changing the demographic composition of the Foreign Service through the maturation of junior officer cohorts. Second, the progress of individual careers (and their organizational consequences) is conceptualized as a function of the relative sizes and locations of entering cohorts. Finally, the importance of control over cohort succession is seen through an examination of the complex patterns of cohort transformation (promotions) during the postwar years. Analysis of the data reveals a variety of practices which buffer the Foreign Service from pressures for rapid transformation. The summary identifies conditions under which studies in the political economy of organizational reproduction and change will benefit from the examination of cohort processes.

In contrast, using a case study of government policy on methadone treatment for heroin addiction, we show that federal decision making has profound impact even at microsociological levels of clinic life. A model drawn from organizations theory is developed to explain the efficacy of federal action. Policy is seen often to embody conflicting or contradictory demands due to governmental agencies' attempts to coopt or placate interests hostile to new policy directions. Governmental monopsony ensures that competing local agencies acquiesce to the details of federal intentions. But internal contradictions in policies limit or undermine local agencies' resources for gaining compliance from their clientele. Thus compromised policies, effectively translated by federal regulation into local practice, result in dysfunctional adaptations by clients, and the policies "fail."

Schwartz	American Sociological Review	47	1	1982-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 45-62	American Sociological Association	fla		Two theorems deduced from the primitive assumptions and definitions of a macrosociological theory of social structure are tested with data on intermarriage in the 125 largest American metropolitan areas (SMSAs). The data base is the public use sample of the 1970 U.S. Census. The two theoretical predictions are: (1) a group's relative size is inversely related to the proportion of its members who are outmarried; and (2) an SMSA's heterogeneity is directly related to the rate of intermarriage in it. The underlying assumption is that the structural constraints of size distributions affect marriage notwithstanding cultural values promoting ingroup marriages. The data confirm the two predictions (corroborating the underlying assumption) for most size differences and most forms of heterogeneity examined. Thus, heterogeneity in national origins, mother tongue, birth region, industry, and occupation raise intermarriage rates in these respects. Although racial heterogeneity does not have this predicted effect, the reason is that the great socioeconomic differences between races consolidate racial boundaries and thereby counteract the influence of heterogeneity on intermarriage. Empirical evidence supports this explanation: when racial income differences are controlled, the predicted positive relationship between racial heterogeneity and intermarriage becomes apparent.

This last theory is predominantly institutional, unlike the emphasis upon religious ideas and motivations in his early Protestant Ethic thesis, and unlike his analyses of the world religions. Weber's institutional theory involves a sequence of causal conditions. The outcome of the sequence is capitalism characterized by the entrepreneurial organization of capital, rationalized technology, free labor, and unrestrained markets. Intermediate conditions are a calculable legal system and an economic ethic combining universal commercialization with the moderate pursuit of repetitive gains. These conditions are fostered by the bureaucratic state and by legal citizenship, and more remotely by a complex of administrative, military, and religious factors. The overall pattern is one in which numerous elements must be balanced in continuous conflict if economic development is to take place. Weber derived much of this scheme in explicit confrontation with Marxism. His conflict theory criticizes as well as deepens and extends a number of Marxian themes, including a theory of international capitalism which both criticizes and complements Wallerstein's theory of the world system.

This emphasis may have led some to ignore the possibility that a label can effect an individual in other ways. In the study "treated cases," individuals who have been treated, are compared to "untreated cases," individuals found to be similar in severity of psychiatric condition but who have not received an official label. Analyses controlling for psychiatric condition and other important variables show that a psychiatric label has a negative impact on income and work status. These results suggest that while a label may or may not directly affect the form of behavior for which it was affixed, it almost certainly has an impact on other areas. Finally, given these pejorative effects, there may be a partial role for labeling theory in understanding the stabilization of psychological disorder if a label increases environmental stress and decreases one's ability to cope with it.

Spenner	American Sociological Review	40	4	1975-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 513-520	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper reanalyzes data from a recent study of the internal stratification of automobile workers in four countries. Where the previous research relied on the inspection of percentage differences in cross-tabulations, this paper utilizes loglinear models for the decomposition of association. The earlier study reported cleavages in participation patterns within the working class. It also noted an "increasing internal stratification of the working class," citing as evidence divergencies in participation by levels of skill and industrialization. Using an appropriate statistical model, the reanalysis reported here shows: (1) only limited support for the hypothesis that participation varies by skill level; (2) little, if any, support that skill differences in participation increase with industrialization; and rather, (3) industrialization is the strongest correlate of participation.

The present paper provides previously unavailable information regarding the production and properties of the DOT data to facilitate assessment of their appropriateness for various research purposes. We describe the data available in the DOT, report on exercises assessing their validity and reliability, consider the desirability of aggregating the data in various ways, present a factor analysis that reduces the 44 characteristics to six factors, compare the third and fourth editions with respect to possible sex bias, and offer a cautionary note regarding the use of successive editions of the DOT to study temporal changes in the American occupational structure.

Cooley	American Sociological Review	46	6	1981-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 805-829	American Sociological Association	fla		Building on the works of Emile Durkheim, a number of scholars have claimed that, for a given society over time and in the absence of major societal upheavals, the proportion of people subjected to punishment by the state closely approximates a constant. In this paper, we address the "Stability of Punishment Hypothesis" with data from California for the period from the opening of the prison system in 1851 to 1970. The Stability of Punishment Hypothesis is formulated through recent modeling developments in macroeconomics, with which the presence of equilibrating tendencies can be explicitly represented, and for the first time direct tests are undertaken. No evidence for the hypothesis is found.

This paper examines (a) the two basic justifications that have been offered for the utilization of this conceptual framework and (b) the methodology that is used to "separate" mobility into its constituent parts. This examination reveals that mobility researchers have either failed to conceptualize structural and circulation mobility in a meaningful fashion and/or have failed to decompose mobility successfully into structural and circulatory components. On the basis of this examination and its implications, it is argued that investigators should abandon the "structure vs. circulation" framework in future work.

Self-reported school grades have a substantial negative relationship with number of older siblings among whites, but not among blacks. The grades of the black respondents have a surprising negative relationship with responsibility for younger siblings. Confluence-model ideas appear to be less adequate for blacks than for whites, but some revisions in the model may be required in the case of whites also. Among whites, grades are curvilinearly related to responsibility for younger siblings, indicating that very frequent responsibility for younger sisters and brothers may be counterproductive. Females report greater responsibility for younger siblings than males, but there is no indication that the sex difference in this variable accounts for the sex difference in grades.

The model examines the process through which residential origin influences adulthood residence as well as the temporal relationship between residential preferences and location. It is argued that the "first move" subsequent to the completion of high school is important in redirecting size-of-place preferences during early adulthood. Moreover, location in mid-adulthood has a strong effect on contemporaneous residential preferences net of preferences seven years earlier. Taken together, the results present a plausible life-course explanation of the observation based on cross-sectional surveys of adults that the modal residential preference is current size of place. Race-sex variations in this model are assessed and suggest models that are not invariant. Theoretical directives and problems for continued research using a life-course perspective are discussed.

Stolte	American Sociological Review	48	3	1983-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 331-342	American Sociological Association	fla		Why does a disadvantaged actor, as well as an advantaged actor, often accept a structure of inequality as right, reasonable, and legitimate? The self-evaluation argument proposes that variation in objective resource level produces variation in self-evaluation, which, in turn, leads both deprived and privileged actors to accept their respective positions as legitimate. The argument is clarified through a reformulation that links exchange structural inequality, negotiation, and self-efficacy. The reformulation is experimentally tested. Though the results diametrically oppose a key implication of the reformulation, they stimulate thinking that further illuminates this core issue in the social psychology of stratification, and they lay a basis for further research.

Evans, Michael Timberlake	American Sociological Review	45	4	1980-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 531-552	American Sociological Association	fla		High levels of economic inequality found in less developed countries have been attributed to the penetration of their economies by investments of multinational enterprises based in more developed nations of the West. This attribution has been widely supported by both historical and quantitative research. There are several interpretations concerning why this might be so, but the one offered here is that foreign investments cause high levels of inequality by distorting the evolution of the labor-force structure. It is suggested that Third World economies penetrated by foreign capital will have unusually rapidly growing proportions of the labor force employed in the tertiary, and it is growth of this proportion which mediates some of the effects of dependence on inequality. Our quantitative analysis of cross-national data (a) corroborates previous research linking dependence to inequality, (b) indicates that dependence is associated with growth of the tertiary, and (c) suggests this is one important link between dependence and inequality.

The hypothesis is generally supported, but the English boys are found to overestimate the significance of ability in the process of educational attainment. This overestimate is also found for older English boys, while older American boys report the most realistic expectations of any of the samples studied. These findings are interpreted as indicating different effects of the institutional characteristics of the two educational systems.

Fifty-one such small collectives were analyzed to determine the effect of composition (group size, age and gender make-up) on helping action in risky situations. This study sought two goals. The first was to suggest a structural-interactional model that integrated numerous findings previously given only ad hoc explanations in the psychological literature. Second, and related, two possible explanations of the collective action/inaction response to risk were evaluated: the "diffusion of responsibility" and the allocation of responsibility (relative to internal social heterogeneity and emerging structure). The latter explanation was supported by our analysis and predicted from the theoretical model.

Koffel	American Sociological Review	40	5	1975-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 585-598	American Sociological Association	fla		There has been no change over time in the relative mobility chances of American men whose fathers held different occupations. Changes in the occupational structure are the only source of systematic variation in rates of intergenerational occupational mobility. Based on this assumption, we have constructed detailed tables of the occupational mobility of U. S. men in 1952, 1962 and 1972. Both between and within cohorts, systematic trends appear which include increasing upward mobility, decreasing downward mobility and, by some measures, a weakening of the relationship between father's and son's occupations. At least for men in the U. S., the shifting occupational structure is the driving force and the problematic issue in changing intergenerational mobility patterns. We suggest that these same ideas be applied in cross-societal research. If there be invariances in the mobility process across societies which match those across time within the U.S., then comparative mobility research should be reoriented to investigate the sources and consequences of transformations of the occupational structure.

Beniger	American Sociological Review	48	1	1983-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 103-111	American Sociological Association	fla		The diffusion of television may increase the proportion of a population that recognizes various public figures and more abstract cultural symbols. This hypothesis is tested with time series of the labeling used in 1,154 editorial cartoons of five leading U.S. metropolitan newspapers. The sample includes at least a hundred cartoons published in each of the nine presidential election years, 1948-1980. Both the proportion of actual persons labeled and the mean number of labeled symbols per cartoon decreased by one-half to two-thirds over the period; both trends were downward with a high degree of statistical significance. Several explanations other than the hypothesized increase in the shared symbolic environment are considered and rejected. Temporal correlation and other indirect inference suggest that television is at least a partial cause of the change. Television's influence on shared images is also noted by the cartoonists themselves. The findings suggest that television may increase the likelihood that cultural symbols can be used to direct a nation's attention, to manipulate public opinion, and to mobilize behavior.

The present analysis employs such a control, and finds that prior estimates of peer influence have been inflated by over 100%. High school peer influence on college aspirations is a weak effect with a path coefficient between .10 and .15 in the models tested.

The analysis demonstrates that the class-dialectic model is highly useful and that it deserves to be treated as a serious guide to studies of political power.

Meyer	American Sociological Review	43	6	1978-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 797-812	American Sociological Association	fla		In the modern world the social role of childhood is increasingly differentiated from adulthood and brought under the jurisdiction of the state. This is not primarily a social organizational process but an institutional or ideological one: the ideological rules of differentiated and state-managed childhood diffuse throughout the global nation-state system regardless of variations among nations in dimensions of organizational development. We show this by coding the constitutions of all nation-states since 1870 for references and rules concerning childhood. Our index summarizing these references rises sharply between 1870 and 1970. At any point, the index does not vary significantly among rich and poor, new and old, or central and peripheral states. Ideological rules concerning childhood are weakly (and decreasingly) related to technical development, and strongly (and increasingly) related to the general authority of the state.

Green	American Sociological Review	49	4	1984-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 541-551	American Sociological Association	fla		A recent review of the effect of sex on courtroom outcomes suggests both that paternalism is alive and well and that the demise of gender-based leniency will emerge as the criminality of women is seen to be increasingly like that of men. This research tests these hypotheses, and a complementary hypothesis, derived from the notion that sex-based differences in sanctioning are due to structural and cultural differences in the lives of male and female offenders. The hypotheses are tested with a sample of men (N = 1,558) and women (N = 1,365) who were convicted of the crimes of theft, forgery and drug law violations over a 16-year timespan (1965-1980). The analyses indicate that (1) the effect of sex on the decision to incarcerate can, in part, be accounted for by the pretrial release decision; and (2) with regard to the pretrial release decision, holding constant the social and cultural differences in the lives of male and female offenders significantly reduces evidence of gender-based leniency over the 16-year period.

A simplified dynamic model of the growth of a population of educational organizations is estimated using various techniques for pooling time series of cross-sectional data. Results lend support to a meta-model of growth in which the dynamic parameters of the process are the dependent variables. Structural inertia, the effects of resources and available candidates are found to depend in a systematic way on structural properties of the educational organizations (cost intensity and the complexity of the division of labor) and characteristics of the national environment (abundance of resources). The findings indicate the usefulness of the ecological approach for the analysis of organizational change.

Spenner	American Sociological Review	48	6	1983-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 824-837	American Sociological Association	fla		Major hypotheses about temporal change in the skill levels of work correspond to notions of upgrading, downgrading, and little net change. This paper identifies reasons why research has been equivocal on the larger question. Research designs yield differing conclusions: aggregate studies suggest little net change in recent years; case studies portray more volatile upgrading and downgrading within subsectors. A comprehensive answer to the question of skill transformation will require more systematic assessment of compositional and work content shifts, more complete sampling of the temporal and spatial domain, and better concepts and measures for skill. An improved approach includes direct measurement of two primary dimensions of skill, substantive complexity and autonomy-control. A review of existing aggregate studies illustrates the methodological problems and suggests future directions and hypotheses.

Jews have a highly positive cultural orientation to education and occupational status, while that of Irish and Anglo-Saxon Catholics is mostly positive, that of Italian Catholics is mixed, and that of German Lutherans is mostly negative. Cultural mediation through high-school academic performance, significant others, and educational plans accounts for part of the religio-ethnic effect on education. Structural factors may account for remaining direct effects. Educational and occupational aspirations are critical cultural mediators of religio-ethnic effects on early occupational attainment. Religio-ethnic effects on achievements--particularly first job--are heightened in an urban subsample. Context-specific group cultural patterns may partly account for this finding, but historically rooted patterns of differential occupational opportunity unique to this city may also be at work.

Thoits	American Sociological Review	46	1	1981-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 97-109	American Sociological Association	fla		I examine the extent to which health-related events account for the well-established relationship between undesirable life events and psychophysiological distress. Employed in the analysis is a distress scale similar to others often used in previous research. This scale, the Macmillan Health Opinion Survey index, relies heavily on psychosomatic symptoms as indicators of distress. The analysis clearly indicates that when health-related events are controlled, other undesirable events have small and nonsignificant effects upon psychophysiological distress. Further, the analysis also shows that health-problem events are more strongly related to physiological than to psychological items on the distress scale. The results clearly suggest that previously well-established correlations between undesirable events and distress may have been inflated due to the operational confounding of health-related items on the independent and dependent variable scales. The implications of these findings for research in the Holmes-Rahe tradition-and for life-events research in general-are discussed.

Using panel regression analyses and structural equation models on a sample of 37 countries, investment dependence is found to have a lagged positive effect on urbanization in 1970. The data suggest that investment dependence stimulates growth in the tertiary and informal sectors, while inhibiting growth in the industrial labor sector. This restructuring of the urban labor force generates increased levels of overurbanization in peripheral countries. Finally it is argued that dependency theory provides a more adequate framework for understanding urbanization in peripheral countries than modernization theory.

Jensen	American Sociological Review	42	2	1977-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 305-317	American Sociological Association	fla		This research on the deterrence doctrine differs from previous investigations by focusing on perceived properties of legal punishments rather than objective properties. Data from a survey of 1,700 high school students in Arizona show a close inverse relation among 15 types of crimes or delinquencies between the median or mean perceived certainty of punishment (arrest or reformatory) and rates of self-reported acts. However, the same relation holds between the rates and the perceived seriousness of acts, which is taken as indicative of the social (extralegal) condemnation of crime. Furthermore, the perceived certainty of punishment and perceived seriousness are so highly collinear that their effects on the rates cannot be differentiated. Although the findings cannot be viewed as conclusive evidence against the deterrence doctrine, they raise doubts about previous interpretations of the inverse relation among states between the objective certainty of imprisonment and crime rates. The relation has no bearing on the perceptual assumptions that enter into the deterrence doctrine, and the present findings indicate that the relation could reflect differential social condemnation of crime.

After identifying certain methodological problems involved in using Science Citation Index citation counts to assess the effects of collegial recognition on later productivity, I report tests of several hypotheses proposed to account for scientists' conformity to productivity norms. Apart from the calibre of the Ph.D. department, measures of socialization have no direct effect on decade productivity. Early productivity and collegial recognition do contribute to decade productivity, but the strength of their effects varies by the research orientation of the first employer: early productivity is more important for those employed in universities, whereas collegial recognition is particularly important for chemists in contexts that do not stress scholarly publication.

Their misrepresentations arise from an effort to reduce Mead's thought to a much narrower scheme of how human social behavior should be studied.

The short-comings of the study of vertical mobility are discussed. Then, assuming the use of interval scales, absolute, exchange and structural mobility are defined and measured at the individual level. Aggregate measures of each mobility component are also presented which can be computed easily from the means, standard deviations and correlation of the origin and destination distributions. Finally, the aggregate measures are applied to occupational status mobility data for 1962 and 1972-1974. Interperiod comparisons are discussed, as well as racial comparisons and sex comparisons. Educational mobility is briefly compared to status mobility.

This review describes the development of expectation states theory, which assumes a burden of proof process by which initially unrelated status characteristics become relevant to task performance, and task specific expectations determine patterns of interaction. Three versions of the theory, with increasing scope, are described and evidence relevant to them is summarized. Data from an independent test of the most recent version are presented, and the review concludes with a summary of knowledge and some suggestions for applications of the theory of status generalization effects.

Utilizing a sample of 714 suburbs, I evaluate a causal model of status persistence and compare the results with previous studies. This study shows that 1960 suburban status characteristics, age and population growth exert significant direct effects on 1970 status levels. However, the effects of growth on 1970 status levels, though significant for two of three status characteristics examined, are primarily spurious. This suggests they have a more minor role in the explanation of status change than is suggested by other studies. Additionally, employment specialization, percent black and suburban age are shown to have substantial indirect effects on 1970 status levels while they exert only small direct effects.

The disclaimer is an interactional tactic employed by actors faced with upcoming events or acts which threaten to disrupt emergent meanings or discredit cathected situational identities. Its function is to predefine such problematic events for others in a manner which reduces their salience as interactional cues. Like "accounts" and "quasi-theories," the disclaimer belongs to a class of events, here called "aligning actions," which routinely serve to preserve situational definitions in the face of disruptive lines of conduct. At a broader level, it is suggested that cultural continuity rests in large part upon such aligning actions.

It is suggested that the paradigm of scientific inquiry that underlies the dominant mode of studying adult development, the ontogenetic model, is not an appropriate foundation for its subject matter because it tends to treat the individual as a self-contained entity and fails to recognize the profoundly interactive nature of self-society relations and the complexity and variability of social environments. Major lines of developmental theory that employ the ontogenetic model are critiqued, and it is argued that sociological applications of developmental work that do not recognize the inherent limitations risk an "ontogenetic fallacy." Drawing on findings and insights from various strands of social research, some essential elements of a "sociogenic paradigm" are identified. The paper ends with a brief illustration of how a sociogenic perspective can lead to a reinterpretation of findings that have been interpreted developmentally by sociologists interested in change in adulthood.

Data from a panel study of agencies with primary financial responsibility for cities, counties and states show the following: (1) bureaus claiming narrow domains and performing essential services remain stable over time; (2) bureaus claiming broad but inconsistent domains contract and lose responsibilities with environmental demand and competition; (3) bureaus claiming broad domains and having the advantages of newness and technological advance expand and augment responsibilities; (4) despite declining resources and responsibilities, claims to domain rarely contract.

Land, Marcus Felson	American Sociological Review	42	6	1977-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 951-964	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper presents a ten-equation dynamic structural equation model that shows how aggregate changes in the occupational structure of the United States affect each other and are affected by economic, technological and institutional changes. The model postulates a recursive flow of causation from changes in sectorial (agricultural, manufacturing, services) demand and productivity to changes in the distribution of occupations by sector, bureaucratization and status level. Model equations are estimated on annual national data from 1947 to 1972 and are used to make conditional forecasts of the endogenous variables for 1973 and 1974. The equations fit the observed data well, lack demonstrable autocorrelation of disturbances, and forecast the 1973 and 1974 values with considerable accuracy. Empirically, the model facilitates the quantitative estimation of the relative effects of economic growth and technological change on expansion of the service economy, bureaucratization of jobs, and growth of high-status occupations. In particular, when combined with recent findings on the sources of intergenerational occupational mobility in twentieth-century American society by Hauser et al. (1975), the model shows how changes in the pattern of economic growth and productivity from that which has prevailed for most of the post-World War II period may imply a decline in the rates of upward occupational mobility in the absence of other counterbalancing structural changes.

Cerulo	American Sociological Review	49	4	1984-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 566-570	American Sociological Association	fla		Recent research has focused on the role of television in enhancing the shared symbolic environment, specifically the argument that the diffusion of television increased the proportion of the American population recognizing public figures and more abstract cultural symbols. This hypothesis has been tested with time series of the labeling used in the editorial cartoons found in five U. S. metropolitan newspapers. The present study examines the hypothesis using magazine covers. The findings offer additional support for the influence of television in increasing shared images. The growth of television corresponds to an increase in the use of symbols on magazine covers, a decrease in the labeling of those symbols, and a decrease in labels used solely to identify public figures. These changes occur most dramatically during the 1950s, a period in which television was rapidly spreading throughout American society.

Kohn	American Sociological Review	46	6	1981-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 720-744	American Sociological Association	fla		In Poland and the United States social stratification is related to parental values and to social orientations, with men of higher position more likely to value self-direction and to have a social orientation consonant with valuing self-direction: a nonauthoritarian perspective, personally responsible standards of morality, and trustfulness. These relationships result in large measure from the greater opportunities afforded by higher position to be self-directed in one's work. In the United States, higher social-stratification position is associated with more favorable self-conceptions, largely as a result of the greater opportunities for occupational self-direction that higher position affords. In Poland, lower position is associated with greater self-confidence and less anxiety.

One model synthesizes the arguments of Wolf, Moore, Hobsbawm and Tilly. The other is Stinchcombe's. Each model is operationalized and tested using multiple regression techniques on county level data. The first synthetic model works well and shows that the most important variable explaining the intensity of the rebellion is the interactive effect of peasant traditionalism and the penetration of market forces in agriculture.

Mare	American Sociological Review	49	4	1984-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 512-525	American Sociological Association	fla		Most discussions of ordinal variables in the sociological literature debate the suitability of linear regression and structural equation methods when some variables are ordinal. Largely ignored in these discussions are methods for ordinal variables that are natural extensions of probit and logit models for dichotomous variables. If ordinal variables are discrete realizations of unmeasured continuous variables, these methods allow one to include ordinal dependent and independent variables into structural equation models in a way that (1) explicitly recognizes their ordinality, (2) avoids arbitrary assumptions about their scale, and (3) allows for analysis of continuous, dichotomous, and ordinal variables within a common statistical framework. These models rely on assumed probability distributions of the continuous variables that underly the observed ordinal variables, but these assumptions are testable. The models can be estimated using a number of commonly used statistical programs. As is illustrated by an empirical example, ordered probit and logit models, like their dichotomous counterparts, take account of the ceiling and floor restrictions on models that include ordinal variables, whereas the linear regression model does not.

Kandel	American Sociological Review	44	2	1979-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 298-310	American Sociological Association	fla		The paper tests the contingent consistency hypothesis that social pressures reinforce the effect of attitude on behavior. The attitudes and behaviors pertain to marihuana use; the contingent effects tested are those of parents and peers. The data derive from a large-scale two-wave panel sample of high school students. By decomposing the sample according to the adolescents' specific position in the developmental continuum from marihuana nonuse to initiation to continued use, we identified the conditions under which the hypothesis is supported. No contingent effects appeared over time. Reinforcement of the effect of attitude by social pressures characterized adolescents in the second survey who had shifted from being nonusers to becoming frequent users over the six-month follow-up interval. By contrast, group norms did not interact with attitude to affect simple initiation to marihuana use or continuing marihuana use. Peer-related norms had the greatest interactive impact; parental norms had very little impact. Decomposition of a cohort according to stages of participation in a behavioral sequence made it possible to specify when in that sequence contingent consistency is most likely to appear.

We hypothesize that the welfare explosion in the late 1960s was in part the result of a two-step process in which civil disorder impelled the national government to enact liberalizations of welfare policy which in turn were most actively implemented by those states most wracked by rioting. Analysis of the relative state growth rates in the number of families receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children suggests the plausibility of our hypothesis and the Piven and Cloward thesis.

An Inquiry into the Value and Use of Merton's Concepts of Manifest and Latent Function	Colin Campbell	American Sociological Review	47	1	1982-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 29-44	American Sociological Association	fla		While the concepts of manifest and latent function are commonly described in textbooks as "valuable" and "important," they are rarely used in sociological research. Merton's original formulation and discussion, together with subsequent criticism, is examined in the hope of finding an explanation for this paradox. Four different meanings of the manifest-latent distinction are identified together with a widespread tendency to replace the contrast between purpose and consquence with that between commonsense knowledge and sociological understanding. This practice is, in turn, related to an inability to accommodate normative and idealistic behavior into the scheme, a fundamental weakness which stems from its character as an unintegrated product of functionalism and action theory. This insight leads into a discussion of some of the larger problems surrounding the juxtaposition of an interpretative, phenomenological approach with that of functionalism and, while recognizing that there is a real need for such a unified perspective, concludes that Merton's manifest and latent function distinction does not meet it.

In a departure from the individual-level inferences often used in prior research, we use an aggregate production function framework to estimate directly educational effects on economic output, net of labor and capital, the two basic factors of production. Using aggregate, time-series analyses, we find that expansion at the secondary and doctorate levels was positively related to economic output in the years since 1933. We do not, however, find consistent evidence for effects of these or other levels of schooling from 1890 to 1928. Consequently, while we have found that educational expansion has made contributions to economic output, the effects of education are more limited and time-specific than shown in previous studies.

First, because they employ data from surveys of "criminal victimization," conduct not considered "crime" by the respondents was lost from view, making a test of the theory impossible. Second, because they attempt to explain law with the "seriousness" of crime, they mistake an evaluation for a description, thereby offering as a solution what is in fact a problem in the sociology of law. The weaknesses in Gottfredson and Hindelang's work may be found in the study of law more generally, and also in the study of other phenomena in sociology.

Using algebraic tools, a set of definitions, procedures, and algorithms collectively entitled "local role analysis" is developed to study and compare relational patterns of individual actors. Local role analysis is then demonstrated using network data on workers' relations in an East African clothing factory undergoing worker-management conflict (Kapferer, 1972). In particular, it is possible to identify who are the leaders in the factory, and to show how the occupants of the leadership roles change over time. These examples suggest that local role analysis offers a practical methodology for studying the interaction between the perspectives of individual actors and the overall structure of roles.

The research focused on a relatively homogeneous group of black and white activists who participated in demonstrations in one of the leading centers of the civil rights movement. A theoretical causal model was developed and tested using nine exogenous and intervening variables to explain adult radical political attitudes and leftist behavior. The model accounts for 45.6 percent of the variance in radical attitudes and 22.2 percent of the variance in leftist behavior. Racial differences in adult politics are explained. Tentative conclusions concerning the consequences of participation in left-wing student politics are presented.

Lincoln, Gerald Zeitz	American Sociological Review	45	3	1980-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 391-408	American Sociological Association	fla		In this paper, we argue that aggregate measures (means computed on distributions of individual scores) may be valid indicators of organizational properties which also enable an investigator to determine whether statistical relations among organizational measures arise from organization-level, as opposed to individual-level, causal processes. We review certain statistical aggregation issues as these pertain to organizational analysis, and we propose Hauser's path analytic model of analysis of covariance as a device for separating individual and structural effects. These methods are then applied to data gathered in a survey of 20 social service organizations. We specify and estimate a causal model wherein administrative intensity, lateral communications, and decentralization of decision making are endogenous variables. We find that a number of "total" effects on these properties mask quite different--and in some cases contradictory--processes at individual and organization levels. Among other inferences, we suggest that the organizational- and individual-level influences we observe on decentralization raise questions regarding certain widely accepted interpretations of this property. We recommend that analysts working with aggregate measures adopt similar procedures in order to fully exploit their data for the insights that may be gained into multilevel organizational processes.

An incremental modeling strategy is employed to test for the effects of social status, the effects of status inconsistency, and the effects of statistical interaction between vertical status and inconsistency. The analysis demonstrates the presence of status inconsistency effects. More importantly, however, the results confirm that the effects of status inconsistency are conditional upon location in the stratification hierarchy.

Cushing	American Sociological Review	42	1	1977-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 157-169	American Sociological Association	fla		Two hypothesis relating responsibility, reward and performance were designed to test the Davis and Moore functional theory of stratification. Large companies in the private sector of the United States economy were selected as the source of empirical evidence to test the theory. The data base was thought to be favorable to positive findings. The responsibility variable was measured by company assets, reward was measured by total compensation of the chief executive officer, and performance was indexed by several measures of growth and profitability. Over 700 of the largest companies in the United States were grouped into sixteen relatively homogenous business activity types in order to control for (1) scarcities of qualified incumbents, (2) structural differences between industries and (3) market conditions. The results provide limited evidence of a relationship between magnitude of responsibility (functional importance) and executive compensation (reward). No support was found for a hypothesized relationship between company performance, however measured, and executive compensation. Taken as a whole, the results do not confirm the functional theory.

Oropesa	American Sociological Review	49	6	1984-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 828-840	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper investigates two aspects of how local areas in the metropolis deal with their problems-the institutional means of representation which are used and the effectiveness of those means. In the Seattle metropolitan region, residents of 20 different local areas recognize three different means as relatively equal in importance. These include neighbors, community clubs, and representatives of the society's authority structure such as government. Across communities, reliance on neighbors and the authority structure seems to be a functional alternative to dependence on community clubs as problem-solving institutions. What we believe to be the relatively strong forms of representation-community clubs-are especially recognized in parts of the metropolis with clear name definitions and homogeneous residential land use. Rated effectiveness of institutions seems to be more similar across communities than the means of representation; it is more directly related to the wealth of the area and the types of social issues faced by the community.

Rindfuss, Larry Bumpass, Craig St. John	American Sociological Review	45	3	1980-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 431-447	American Sociological Association	fla		The interplay between education and fertility has a significant influence on the roles women occupy, when in their life cycle they occupy these roles, and the length of time spent in these roles. The overall inverse relationship between education and fertility is well known; but little is known about the theoretical and empirical basis of this relationship. This paper explores the theoretical linkages between education and fertility and then examines the relationships between the two at three stages in the life cycle. It is found that the reciprocal relationship between education and age at first birth is dominated by the effect from education to age at first birth with only a trivial effect in the other direction. Once the process of childbearing has begun, education has essentially no direct effect on fertility; but it has a large indirect effect through age at first birth.

They have also suggested that if status effects are present, they are observable only when crime is measured officially and not when it is measured through self-report techniques. In this paper we examine the adequacy of past measures of both status and criminality and reassess the relationship between these concepts when each is measured in a more extensive manner than has been customary in past research. The analysis suggests that the relationship between status and juvenile delinquency is indeed weak but that the relationship between status and adult criminality is strong and inverse. Moreover, the social status of the subject appears to be far more important in accounting for criminal behavior than is the status of the family of origin. Finally, when self-reported and official criminality are measured in parallel fashion, the results appear to be concordant rather than discordant.

Hindelang	American Sociological Review	44	1	1979-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 3-18	American Sociological Association	fla		In The Behavior of Law, Black (1976) sets forth a theory of law that he argues explains variations in law across societies and among individuals within societies. Black argues that law can be conceived of as a quantitative variable, measured by the number and scope of prohibitions, obligations and other standards to which people are subject. Law varies, according to Black, with other aspects of social life, including stratification, morphology, culture, organization, and social control. Many of Black's principal propositions regarding the quantity of law are tested in this paper with National Crime Survey data on the victim's decision to report a crime to the police. An alternative model that views the quantity of law as depending largely on the gravity of the infraction against legal norms is posed and tested against Black's theory. The data are generally inconsistent with the propositions derived from The Behavior of Law and strongly suggest that a theory attempting to explain the criminal law cannot ignore the gravity of the infraction against legal norms.

Marshall Townsend	American Sociological Review	40	6	1975-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 739-752	American Sociological Association	fla		Matched samples of German and American high school students and mental hospital staffs completed a 60-item questionnaire on conceptions of mental illness. The conceptions of these groups showed greater differences between countries than between popular and professional views within each country. Furthermore, comparing these conceptions with a previous report on mental patients' conceptions in Germany and America, the conceptions of mental patients were found to parallel those of the public and hospital staff in their respective countries. These conceptions appeared to influence patients' coping behavior within the hospital. These results supported the application of labeling theory to mental disorders. But the results did not support the view that specific stereotypes of the mentally ill structure specific symptomatology. Stereotypes were not prominent in the responses of patients, staff or students in either country, and differences in the public's and professionals' responses to stereotypes within each country were greater than differences between the two countries.

Three dimensions of status are measured, by means of indices of relative status, within the metropolitan context. Disaggregated, the data show six types of status careers over the thirty-year period, but the most prevalent is decline. Techniques of cohort analysis are employed to discriminate among areas constructed at different times. Two kinds of cohorts emerge in the city, prewar and postwar. The latter never attain the upper-middle status previously held by the older places. Hypotheses regarding the effects on status change of age-of-place, age and race composition, and housing are tested in multiple regression analyses. The analysis shows the dramatic decline of status among city areas relative to the suburban communities. Residential areas conform to the neighborhood life cycle; most city areas are in a stage of decline, although a few are rising in status.

McMullin	American Sociological Review	46	6	1981-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 907-917	American Sociological Association	fla		The inverse relation between the size and density of territorial subdivisions has been derived from a general theory which assumes that social structures evolve so as to minimize time expenditure. This paper reviews the empirical work done on the size-density relation, its derivation from time-minimization theory, and the application of that theory to other empirical relations. We derived a new relation: service-center density is proportional to population density raised to the two-thirds power. Unlike the earlier size-density relation, this new relation makes possible a test of the theory even when the areas of subdivisions are unknown, as in the case of United States counties during most of the period of their formation. Finally, we propose an alternative explanation, that random data alone would produce results equivalent to those expected from time-minimization theory. The findings support time-minimization theory but not the alternative explanation.

This issue is examined through an investigation of the structure of an elite interaction network as revealed by recently developed procedures for network analysis. The data, taken from the American Leadership Study conducted by the Bureau of Applied Social Research in 1971 and 1972, consist of interviews with 545 leaders of major political, economic and social institutions. The study's wide institutional representation, sociometric data, and focus on major issues of the early 1970s make it virtually unique for examining elite integration.

Applying a newly developed data base (Murdock's Ethnographic Atlas) this research investigated the degree to which males, to the exclusion of females, assumed the role of task specialist in the subsistence economy. In 862 societies, examined over 5 critical subsistence variables, analyses revealed that women contribute appreciably to their respective subsistence economies. Over all societies women contributed an average of 44% of subsistence production, thus providing no support for this assumed universal characteristic of the family.

This paper attempts to clarify the meaning of structural inertia and to derive propositions about structural inertia from an explicit evolutionary model. The proposed theory treats high levels of structural inertia as a consequence of a selection process rather than as a precondition for selection. It also considers how the strength of inertial forces varies with age, size, and complexity.

Frankel	American Sociological Review	47	3	1982-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 416-426	American Sociological Association	fla		This study experiments with different ways of informing respondents about a survey in order to see how such differences affect the quality of the data collected and the meaning of the experience for them. Extending earlier work on informed consent in personal interviews, it replicates essential features of the earlier study in telephone interviews with an RDD sample. Two factors were varied in the present study: information about the content of the interview, and information about its purpose. Neither of these significantly affected the response rate to the survey as a whole, item nonresponse, or response quality. The response rate was highest among those respondents given the most information about the survey's content and purpose, but again not significantly so. There was, however, a suggestion that nonresponse to the most sensitive items on the questionnaire may have been adversely affected by disclosure of the study's methodological purpose. By far the largest variation in response rate to the survey occurred among interviewers, rather than as a result of the experimentally varied survey introductions.

Krauze	American Sociological Review	47	5	1982-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 615-625	American Sociological Association	fla		The hypothesis of cumulative advantage is widely accepted in the sociology of science, but empirical tests have been few and equivocal. One approach, originated by Allison and Stewart (1974), is to see whether inequality of productivity and recognition increases as a cohort of scientists ages. This paper extends their work by examining true cohorts of biochemists and chemists rather than synthetic cohorts. Increasing inequality is observed for counts of publications but not for counts of citations to all previous publications. It is also shown that a mathematical model of cumulative advantage does not imply increasing inequality. When the model is modified to allow for heterogeneity in the rate of cumulative advantage, however, increasing inequality is implied.

Harris	American Sociological Review	41	3	1976-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 432-442	American Sociological Association	fla		Data generated by 234 young black and white inmates in 1971 challenge the assumption, widely held within the labeling perspective, that "spoiled identity" is a necessary, socially invariant outcome of deviant commitment and self-definition. The findings reveal that while for whites "criminal" self-typing is significantly related to the spoiling of identity, as operationalized by a series of measures of psychological well-being; for blacks the relationship between such typing and identity spoliation is not significant. Even stronger cross-race interaction is observed on a related aspect of identity: while for whites instrumental commitment to criminal choice is also associated with heightened identity spoliation, for blacks higher levels of criminal commitment are associated with lessened spoliation (i.e., higher levels of psychological well-being). An argument is developed which attempts to interpret these findings in the more general theoretical context of caste, social membership, and ascribed versus attained status. It is noted that the findings and their interpretation suggest a line of research of potentially broad significance, not only in terms of labeling theory and its refinement, but in the more general terms of deviance, stratification and mobility.

Social contexts which do not provide the individual with sufficient control over the dense home environment are defined. Items from a national survey are chosen to measure dissatisfaction with the dwelling, family relations, social life, and personal well-being. The results indicate that respondents in higher-density homes have more negative evaluations if they are mothers, have low social status in the household, or live with young children.

Ability and social status of student body composition are distinguished, and the interpersonal and social comparison processes by which their effects tend to offset each other are specified. Whereas the contextual effects of ability were found to be negative, those of social status were positive. Since the two contextual variables themselves are positively and strongly correlated, their effects are almost exactly offsetting in the long run. The model is examined on data for a national sample first surveyed in 1955 as high school sophomores and followed up in 1973.

Before World War I, it instituted workers' compensation, old age pensions, health insurance, and the world's first compulsory system of unemployment insurance. By the end of the nineteenth century, the United States had expanded Civil War pensions into de facto old age and disability pensions for many working- and middle-class Americans. However, during the Progressive Era, as the Civil War generation died off, the United States failed to institute modern pensions and social insurance. Conventional theories of welfare-state development-theories emphasizing industrialization, liberal values, and demands by the organized industrial working class-cannot sufficiently account for these contrasting British and U.S. patterns. Instead, a macropolitical explanation is developed. By the early twentieth century, Britain had a strong civil service and competing, programmatically oriented political parties. Patronage politics had been overcome, and political leaders and social elites were willing to use social spending as a way to appeal to working-class voters. However, the contemporary United States lacked an established civil bureaucracy and was embroiled in the efforts of Progressive reformers to create regulatory agencies and policies free of the "political corruption" of nineteenth-century patronage democracy. Modern social-spending programs were neither governmentally feasible nor politically acceptable at this juncture in U.S. political history.

There has been some question whether bias reduction earned through the randomized response approach is sufficient to compensate for its inefficiency. By comparing self-reported arrests for two interview conditions (randomized response and direct question) with corresponding true scores appearing in police arrest files, a field-validation of a quantitative randomized response model was attempted. Overall, randomized response outperformed the more traditional direct-question method. Not only was there substantial reduction in mean response error, but the response error operative in the randomized response condition appeared to be random rather than systematic. A mean squared error comparison of the two conditions appears to assuage the concern over its relative inefficiency.

We argue that both sets of literature represent partial but uncontextualized portrayals of a particular historical configuration of class relations in American society. The paper documents this assertion by demonstrating how American stratification theory and research reflects and expresses the increasing penetration of market relations and instrumental rationality into social relations in an advanced capitalist society. The basic outlines of status attainment, its criticisms, and the historical changes in society that fostered the development of these models are sketched. Finally, historical and conceptual developments are related through the logic of the commodity form.

Viewing mobility as a semi-Markov process suggests that the rate of mobility is a proper object of explanation, and the status attainment literature suggests substantive determinants. In particular, I argue that the rate at which a person leaves a job declines with duration in the job and depends on initial levels of job rewards, stationary and changing individual resources, and on the distribution of rewards and resources in the social system. Results from testing the proposed model with data on 1609 jobs of 456 different Chicano men support most points of the argument.

Robinson, Wendell Bell	American Sociological Review	43	2	1978-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 125-143	American Sociological Association	fla		In an exploratory study of matched samples in England and the United States, we construct a path model that explains 26% and 39%, respectively, of the variance in social judgments about the fairness or unfairness of equality. The underdog principle, from which we predict that egalitarians compared to inegalitarians are more likely to be nonwhite, to have low prestige occupations, to have low family incomes, and to identify with the lower and working classes, is accepted. The principle of enlightenment, from which we predict a positive relationship between education and favorable attitudes toward equality, is accepted for England but not for the United States. The principle of an egalitarian Zeitgeist, from which we predict younger people are more egalitarian than older people, is accepted for the United States but not for England. Two additional important causal variables are found. First, a sense of personal equity, that is, a belief that a person has the standard of living that he/she deserves, reduces egalitarian attitudes in England more than in the United States and may reflect a cultural belief that British society is extraordinarily just because social arrangements result from fair rules of the game. While it is of no importance in England, the cultural belief in monetary success reduces egalitarian attitudes in the United States and functions as the belief in the just society does in England.

But there are other possibilities. Some Marxist writers describe "contradictions" in advanced capitalist nations which make their continued economic growth problematic. Recent "limits-to-growth" writers imply likewise that nations may be subject to diminishing returns to scale as large economies increasingly confront resource constraints ("scale entropy"). This analysis uses data for 105 nations to assess the effects of country size on economic growth rate, 1950-1977. Contrary to conventional arguments, domestic market size has no independent effect on rate of economic growth. However, when market size is decomposed so that the effects of population size and per capita income are separated, an interesting pattern emerges: population has a modest positive effect on growth rate, while per capita income has a substantial negative effect. Consistent with the scale entropy view, the negative income effect suggests that affluence may entail costs which slow economic growth.

Pampel	American Sociological Review	42	3	1977-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 422-437	American Sociological Association	fla		Most American sociological research has conceptualized the occupational structure as a continuous prestige hierarchy. The research reported here questions the generality of that conceptualization by examining the relative importance of manual-nonmanual class differences and prestige differences for several attitudes and behaviors. First, the perception of "working class" and "middle class" more closely reflects a manual-nonmanual dichotomy than a continuous prestige scale. Voting behavior and party identification are also better predicted by the dichotomy. Second, the relevance of bounded class and continuous status models varies according to the issues involved. Thus, some interpersonal behaviors and individual satisfactions are patterned according to continuous prestige rankings while opinions on societal issues reflect dichotomous class differences. Third, individuals vary in their propensity to use class or status models according to social structural influences. For instance, a prestige orientation is fostered by small, traditional industries while the class dichotomy is more important in large, bureaucratic industries. The evidence also indicates that occupational prestige is more a middle-class concern, with little importance for manual workers.

Class categories are used to map out mobility patterns across locations in the social relations of production rather than across locations in status hierarchies. Data on patterns of intergenerational mobility derived from the marriage records of 1830 and 1872 are used to document the rigidity of class boundaries at different points in time, the sources of recruitment for newly emerging working-class positions, and the impact of changes in production relations upon the character and meaning of mobility patterns. Changes in mobility patterns are situated within the historical context of the changing social relations of production that marked the rise of early industrial capitalism. The final section of the paper provides some hypotheses regarding the impact of changing mobility patterns upon the process of class formation.

Wilson	American Sociological Review	41	3	1976-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 414-431	American Sociological Association	fla		Main and interactive effects of racial differences in educational attainment are examined on the basis of a recent longitudinal sample of the U.S. high school population. Availability of appropriate measures permits comparison between "comprehensive" models of the attainment sequence between blacks and whites. In agreement with past results, it is found that blacks have higher educational attainment than whites of similar parental status and ability. This additive race effect disappears, however, when the full set of intervening variables is considered. Race interactions are found to affect all endogenous variables. Differences in the process of educational attainment point to the stronger relative role of parental status, measured ability, and school grades among whites, and of self-esteem and educational aspirations among blacks. Implications of these findings, as they suggest differences between "insiders" and "outsiders" to institutional channels for attainment, are examined. Limitations of the data and lines for future research are discussed.

Hindelang	American Sociological Review	42	4	1977-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 571-587	American Sociological Association	fla		Recent research on intelligence and delinquency suggests that (1) the relation is at least as strong as the relation of either class or race to official delinquency; (2) the relation is stronger than the relation of either class or race to self-reported delinquency. In an analysis of the history of the research on the IQ-delinquency relation, we trace the developments leading to the current textbook position that IQ is not an important factor in delinquency. This position, which came into vogue about forty years ago and is still held by many sociologists, has its roots in: (1) a medical to sociological paradigm shift in this century; (2) the failure of subsequent research to substantiate the early exorbitant claims that low IQ was a necessary and sufficient condition for illegal behavior; (3) early negative reviews of research on this question by Sutherland and others; (4) reservations about the validity of the measurement of both IQ and delinquency; (5) erroneous interpretation of research findings; (6) speculation regarding factors which might account for the relation. It is noted that many currently prominent sociological theories of delinquency implicitly or explicitly use IQ as a crucial theoretical element. We show that IQ has an effect on delinquency independent of class and race, and we argue that this effect is mediated through a host of school variables.

Grusky	American Sociological Review	48	4	1983-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 494-506	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper presents a theory of labor market segmentation which pertains to regional sectors rather than dual industrial structures. Two positions are advanced regarding the effects of regional industrialization on status attainment parameters. Whereas the thesis of industrialism describes the emergence of nonascriptive patterns of allocation, the status maintenance thesis contends this transition is impeded by concurrent declines in educational inequality and occupational upgrading. These conflicting positions are examined by estimating attainment models within twelve Japanese regions varying widely in economic development. Results suggest moderate regional heterogeneity in attainment coefficients, implying that estimation of a single national model entails misspecification. The pattern of regional variation provides partial support for the status maintenance thesis, with occupational upgrading particularly important for the development of meritocratic organization. Macro-level structural models of these relationships are presented.

Analysis of data from samples of cultivators in 84 agrarian communities in Andhra Pradesh, India, found little support for Cancian's theory that rank inhibits risk-taking, even under conditions specified as necessary for such effects. Analysis of variance results suggested that increases in status among the poor might result in as much or more of the innovation expected to increase food production as would the present concentration of new opportunities among the rich. While these results appeared to be fairly consistent across different kinds of communities, innovation increased with increased inequality in the distribution of wealth (controlling for the effects of individual status). However, knowledge in inequality slightly inhibited innovation, apparently because relatively simple information about modern farming practices was widely diffused.

A scale is advanced to measure relative degree of processing of exports and it is shown that specializing in the export of goods with low levels of processing has a significant negative effect on economic growth. The broader results suggest that position in the world economy is an important determinant of the economic fate of nations.

Erlanger	American Sociological Review	42	2	1977-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 233-248	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper considers the extent to which participation as a salaried professional in a reform-oriented organization affects the participant's subsequent career. This issue is studied in the context of one such organization, the OEO sponsored Legal Services Program, which was probably the largest and best known organization oriented to the redistribution of professional services in the late 1960s. Because of the paucity of literature on the consequences of participation in reform organizations, a related literature, that of the consequences of participation in the student movement of the sixties, is drawn upon for insight, yet also critically examined. Comparison of the subsequent careers of 228 lawyers in Legal Services in 1967 to those of 981 other lawyers who were practicing law in 1967 indicates that participation in the program has an important effect on both the distribution of professional services and the rendering of reform-oriented pro bono (free or reduced fee) work. In contrast to previous studies, the explanation offered here differentiates between various components of socialization. In addition, the importance of job market factors is stressed. A further difference from previous work is the consideration, albeit brief, of the effects of variation in experience in the organization.

Appelbaum	American Sociological Review	43	1	1978-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 67-80	American Sociological Association	fla		Conventional sociological theory is unable to account for endogenous change at the structural level. While various sociologists have attempted to develop a framework that would account for such change by abstracting formalized elements out of Marxist theory, these efforts--precisely because of their highly formal nature--are unsuccessful. Marx's theory itself seeks to explain change as built into the contradictory survival requirements of class societies conceived as closed social systems. The forces militating for change play themselves out with quasi-automatic necessity. The direction of change depends partly on the structural parameters and partly on the consciousness of individuals organized into social classes. It is argued that the utility of Marx's approach is tied both to his overall theoretical framework, and its rootedness in specific historical, social and economic conditions. This argument is illustrated with reference to Marx's theory of the falling rate of profit under conditions of competitive capitalism.

Sobel	American Sociological Review	46	6	1981-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 893-906	American Sociological Association	fla		Designs for the analysis of mobility effects are flawed by the manner in which the effects of origins and destinations are parametrized. Consequently, suggestions that mobility experiences do not affect attitudes and behaviors are inconclusive. A new class of models (diagonal mobility models) for the analysis of mobility effects which are demonstrably grounded in sociological theory is proposed, and estimation of these models is discussed. To illustrate the use of these models, a reanalysis of the relationship between fertility and intergenerational mobility is presented, using data from the 1962 Occupational Changes in a Generation (OCG-1) survey. The effects of origin and destination on fertility do not depend upon particular origin or destination classes; the effect of destination on fertility appears to be stronger than the effect of origin; and there is only weak evidence of mobility effects.

Using both direct measures of racial occupational inequality and log-linear techniques, we find ample evidence to support the conclusion that city differences in racial occupational inequality are pronounced and merit investigation by social scientists. Thus, we reaffirm the longstanding research tradition investigating city differences in racial occupational inequality.

The findings show that a substantial portion of the effects of socioeconomic indicators on ability can be interpreted in terms of conditions within the family environment. These effects seem more important for the enhancement of verbal abilities than nonverbal ones.

A simultaneous model which recognizes the interdependence of the police expenditure function with the crime and total city revenue functions is tested using data for a sample of 90 U.S. cities. Racial composition and the level of black mobilization activity were significant predictors of municipal policing expenditures. Race-related variables appear to have had a greater effect on police capital expenditures than on expenditures for salaries and operations.

Zurcher, Jr., Sheldon Ekland-Olson	American Sociological Review	45	5	1980-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 787-801	American Sociological Association	fla		Past examinations of differential recruitment to and the differential growth of social movements have typically sought explanation at a social psychological/motivational level of analysis. That focus has recently been called into question by scholars concerned with the process through which movement organizations expand their ranks and mobilize support for their causes. Yet, as Useem (1975) and Zald and McCarthy (1979) have noted, there has been little systematic research conducted on the details of the influence process. Drawing on data derived from a synthesis of existing research and two primary sources, this paper attempts to shed greater empirical and theoretical light on the movement recruitment process. The findings indicate that differential recruitment is not merely a function of dispositional susceptibility, but is strongly influenced by structural proximity, availability, and affective interaction with movement members. The findings also indicate that a movement organization's network attributes function as an important determinant of its recruitment strategies and growth.

DeFleur	American Sociological Review	40	1	1975-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 88-103	American Sociological Association	fla		Despite repeated demonstrations that a variety of factors bias official records, such records are widely used in deviance research. The crucial issue relating to such use is whether biasing factors are random (tending to cancel each other out) or systematic (reducing validity for research to unacceptable degrees). Deviance statistics are generated in contexts whose numerous biasing factors can distort the occurrence rates of deviant acts. This study examines the influence of such factors on drug arrest records in Chicago. Three decades of arrests were studied and related to findings from extensive field research in the Narcotics Division of the Chicago Police. Drug arrest statistics for both whites and nonwhites revealed distinct trends and distributions over time and space. These patterns reflect systematic biases in the operations of police assigned to the Narcotics Division. These and other such biases argue that we ought not to rely on indices of drug activity derived from arrest records.

Waite	American Sociological Review	42	5	1977-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 769-783	American Sociological Association	fla		Fertility, female labor force participation, and the relationship between them are key subjects in a number of theoretical and applied areas of sociology. Because sex role norms and the widespread use of birth control devices have given American women much control over their fertility and substantial choice in their labor force activity (or inactivity), understanding the development and interrelationship of labor force participation plans and fertility expectations assumes great importance in understanding actual labor force participation and actual fertility. As a step toward understanding this development, we describe and attempt to explain the effect of women's age on the relationship between their labor force participation plans and their fertility expectations. Using data from a national sample of young women aged 19 to 29 in 1973 (N = 3,589), we find a strong, linear relationship (r = -.96) between women's age and the effect of their plans for labor force participation on the number of children that they expect to bear in their lifetime. An explanation of this finding (called the Learning Hypothesis) is advanced which survives tests against several plausible alternative hypotheses. Policy implications and productive paths for future research are discussed.

Workforce size is a major dimension of stratification within the U.S. business population and in the capitalist class. Analysis of income determination among 468 small business owners demonstrates the usefulness of a continuous rather than a categorical conceptualization of fractions within the capitalist class. Workforce size is a more powerful predictor of income than other variables traditionally used in studies of economic inequality.

These hypotheses are developed from a multiple hierarchy approach to stratification: intersections of race and gender create unique social aggregates, the life chances and experiences of which assume patterns that cannot be anticipated by simply adding the effects of race to those of gender. It is found that black males are more traditional in sex-role outlook than white males, especially so among those identifying themselves as middle class. However, black females are not consistently more feminist in sex-role outlook than white females. Interpretations for these findings are discussed.

The present research initially elaborates three abstract perspectives on the state and on United States budgetary practices. Then, using factor share income as a proxy for broad class groupings, this research provides a time-series regression analysis of the impact of state expenditures and revenue extraction on the distribution of income in the United States for the years 1949-1976. Results suggest that governmental revenue policies have had a procapital bias while state expenditures have tended to favor labor relative to capital. The net impact of these contradictory tendencies has left the market-based income distribution relatively unchanged despite the sizeable growth of the public sector during the period under study.

Turner	American Sociological Review	48	4	1983-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 506-519	American Sociological Association	fla		Weber's writings on action and the explanation of action do not present a particularly coherent view. In his earlier writings, from 1903-1907, he is under the sway of a juristic conception of cause based on the probability doctrines of von Kries, and this is reflected in his writings on action, which de-emphasize problems of interpretation and stress the analytic uses of methods of causal analysis. In the Logos essay, problems of interpretation and problems of cause and probability are discussed on a par. In the "Introduction" to Economy and Society, problems of interpretation, in particular of the application of the ideal-type "rational action," become central. The terminology of the von Kriesian theory disappears, and the requirements for "causal adequacy" are minimized, as is the analytic role of causal reasoning. Weber's various arguments are intelligible solutions to standard problems in the philosophy of action with recent analogues, notably in the work of Donald Davidson. These solutions suggest an alternative account of the significance of "intelligibility" as an aim of sociological approaches to action.

Reitzes	American Sociological Review	49	1	1984-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 117-130	American Sociological Association	fla		Exchange and symbolic interaction perspectives recognize that individuals actively appraise and assess situations; that expectations and benefits derive their meanings from definitions of the situation and past experiences; and that interactions are not fixed and predetermined but open to negotiation and change. The application of this shared orientation to the intergenerational family role suggests that social background and related roles, subjective meanings and self-feelings, as well as exchange processes influence the interaction of adult children and their elderly parents. Data are derived from a national sample of elderly widows and married persons. Findings include: (1) marital status creates differences in the character and importance of the intergenerational role; (2) the subjective significance attributed to adult children is a major factor which influences patterns of intergenerational interaction; and (3) exchange patterns appear to be more important in influencing the self-feelings of widows than married persons.

Lineberry	American Sociological Review	41	4	1976-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 706-725	American Sociological Association	fla		The "ecological" approach to explaining variations in power structure and the current use of undimensional models of leadership structure are the major concerns here. This investigation attempts to overcome some of the problems associated with previous efforts by relating community structural variables to leadership arrangements, paying special attention to the results obtained when three alternative measures of "reputational" leadership--visibility, legitimacy and centralization--are used in two "samples" of communities. A factor analysis of community demographic and economic variables is used as the point of departure for identifying community dimensions and selecting indicators of each. Regression analysis is then used to test hypotheses suggested by previous research findings. The results from both samples of communities and the comparison of findings using the three leadership measures suggest (1) the inadequacy of unidimensional leadership structure conceptualizations, (2) the persistent problems of sampling and statistical analysis in the comparative analysis of community power and (3) the possibility that there are inherent limits to the explanatory power of the ecological approach.

The approach focuses on intragenerational occupational mobility in a continuously operative job system. One model views mobility in terms of manflows, the other as interrelated job vacancy moves. Application is to an internal labor market--a state police system. The data are continuous for 43 years (1927-1970). Both models are found to be quite accurate in predictions once stationarity was approximated: 1949-1970. This study along with other open system studies suggests that Markov chain models are more generally adequate than has been concluded from closed cohort analyses. The models have general applicability to job systems, whether or not formally organized.

Hamilton	American Sociological Review	42	6	1977-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 877-891	American Sociological Association	fla		A recurrent theme in the literature on modernization is the importance of Westernization in non-Western societies--the purchase of Western commodities and the emulation of Western styles. This paper critically examines this theme in relation to a negative case, the lack of Westernization in nineteenth-century China. Three different theories of consumption that have been offered to explain the nonacceptance of Western products in China--an economic theory, a cultural theory and a sociological theory--are analyzed from comparative and historical perspectives. On the basis of this analysis, it is suggested that Westernization during the nineteenth century can often be viewed more accurately as an indicator of stratificational continuity with the premodern era than as an indicator of modernizing changes.

Two studies have recently presented findings that call this research tradition into question. The studies are reviewed, and it is argued that these contradictory findings are the result of an incorrect specification of the relationship between poverty and the homicide rate. Revised estimates of the effect of poverty are reported which show that it is a significant positive predictor of the homicide rate for a sample of SMSAs (N = 125) when the nonlinear form of the relationship is taken into account. That effect, however, appears to vary by the regional location of SMSAs, that is, whether they are in the South or non-South. The implications of the findings for economic and subcultural explanations of homicide are briefly discussed.

Substantively, we argue that a universal model of how humans make such judgments must allow for assessing both deeds of the actor being judged and role-related social obligations governing what the actor should have done. Structurally, such a model can incorporate cross-cultural differences in terms of differential weights placed on these factors. The model was tested in sample surveys of Yokohama and Kanazawa, Japan, using responses to experimentally varied hypothetical vignettes. It was predicted that the Japanese would replicate previous findings for American respondents (in Detroit), but would at the same time differ significantly in their weighting of deed-related versus role-related variations in vignettes as determinants of an actor's responsibility. The bulk of results originally obtained in Detroit were in fact replicated in both Yokohama and Kanazawa. Predicted cultural differences were also confirmed in comparisons of each Japanese survey with the prior American one; Japanese placed greater emphasis on an actor's role position and an act's social context, relative to an American emphasis on aspects of an actor's deed per se. Further practical implications of these cultural differences for our legal system are also discussed.

A local-cosmopolitan theory is proposed which attempts to identify an important "plausibility structure" for traditional, church-type religion today. Analysis of data from a sample of North Carolina Episcopalians shows that this theory not only explains multidimensional religiosity patterns, but also provides a parsimonious interpretation for the effects of education and community size. Implications for the changing social basis of church religion in modern society and the process of secularization are discussed.

Five distinct aims underlying federal support of academic social research are hypothesized, and a different observable funding pattern is associated with each one. Depending on the specific aim of the funding, certain categories of academic social scientists are more likely to receive federal backing than others. Actual funding patterns are observed in data from a probability sample of 1,079 faculty members in the disciplines of anthropology, economics, political science and psychology. Observed federal allocations indicate that the government's purposes are: (1) to acquire policy-relevant research and (2) to advance basic social science. Observed funding patterns also suggest that the government's purposes are not: (3) to enhance the legitimacy of the government, (4) to increase the acceptability of conducting academic inquiry for the government nor (5) to ensure a productive return on the government's investment. The paper concludes with a possible explanation for the government's interest in producing social knowledge for the advancement of social science.

Miller	American Sociological Review	43	1	1978-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 23-35	American Sociological Association	fla		Past explanations of violence have characteristically paid more attention to the issues of social conditions and psychocultural stimuli than to the issue of timing. Timing is the focus of this paper in which a differential equation model of the temporal diffusion of violence is developed. This model is derived from behavioral generalizations which indicate that aggression is both instigated and inhibited via direct and vicarious learning. The parameters of the model provide measures of the instigation and inhibition processes that take place throughout an outbreak. Twenty-five data sets representing a wide variety of collective outbreaks of violence are used to test the empirical fit and to evaluate the credibility of the assumptions of the model. The model describes the overtime distribution of incidents quite accurately and the assumptions and implications of the derivation appear to be consistent with the cultural conditions surrounding the outbreaks.

Loscocco	American Sociological Review	48	1	1983-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 78-90	American Sociological Association	fla		The study of age differences in job satisfaction is a useful focus for investigating the interplay among work, self, and family concepts as they produce changes in role outcomes during the life course. Using data from the 1972-73 Quality of Employment Survey as well as other data sets, we find that age is positively related to job satisfaction. A relatively substantial portion of these differences are explained by age variations in work values and job rewards. These findings are consistent with both cohort and job change explanations of age differences in job satisfaction. However, some of these age inequalities are not explicable on the basis of the variables in our model. Though some unknown portion of these age differences are undoubtedly due to compositional effects, we argue that they also partly reflect more general processes of aging and development.

Discussions of this possibility have been limited to a very small number of case studies--often as limited as the experience of a single nation in a single war. A major obstacle to the general investigation of this question has been the unavailability of comparative data on homicide rates. Over a three-year period, a Comparative Crime Data File was assembled. The file includes time-series rates of homicide for roughly 110 nations beginning in about 1900. Postwar rather than wartime homicide rates were analyzed, since postwar data appear much less problematic and are likely to be affected by artifacts in only a conservative direction. The homicide data were analyzed to: (1) determine if postwar increases did occur and (2) identify which of seven competing theoretical models appeared to offer the most adequate explanation. The homicide rate changes after 50 "nation-wars" were compared with the changes experienced by 30 control nations. The major finding of the study was that most of the nation-wars in the study did experience substantial postwar increases in their rates of homicide. These increases were pervasive, and occurred after large wars and smaller wars, with several types of homicide rate indicators, in victorious as well as defeated nations, in nations with both improved and worsened postwar economies, among both men and women offenders and among offenders of several age groups. Homicide rate increases occurred with particular consistency among nations with large numbers of combat deaths. Using homicide and other data, it was possible to disconfirm or demonstrate the insufficiency of six of the seven explanatory models.

Temporal and spatial differences in the incidence, forms, targets, and content of industrial protest are explained in terms of the way in which divergent local patterns of capitalist industrialization intersected with national-level political changes to alter workers' interests/grievances and capacities. The research documents a disjuncture between the conditions within which interest polarization between labor and capital was sharpest and the conditions under which capacities for collective industrial protest were strongest. Although full-scale proletarianization did create an intense polarization of interests between workers and employers, it did not produce the strongest capacities for collective action because such capacities were not narrowly rooted in production. They were shaped by other factors, including the persistence of preexisting traditional communities, labor market vulnerability, and the changing political opportunity structure, which are not reducible to the development of productive forces.

Bielby	American Sociological Review	49	4	1984-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 454-473	American Sociological Association	fla		Stratification researchers have increasingly embraced segmentation perspectives, dividing industries into groups believed to exhibit different work arrangement and opportunity structures. Previous research, however, indicates only limited support for those predictions. This paper assesses the utility of segmentation approaches by conceptualizing and measuring sectors organizationally, rather than among industries. Center and periphery enterprises are distinguished along two interrelated dimensions: the complexity of their organizational forms (size, structure, and technology) and the degree of market power or environmental dominance. These dimensions are operationalized and tested in analyses of more than 400 work organizations. Our formulation captures predicted organizational differences in work and opportunity. For example, as hypothesized, establishments that are high on these dimensions rely more on internal career ladders and the proliferation of job titles. While coarse taxonomies of economic segmentation may accurately represent the economic extremes, however, they obscure the diversity of enterprises between those extremes. Stratification and work arrangements can be better understood by analyzing their specific organizational and environmental determinants.

Waite	American Sociological Review	41	1	1976-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 65-80	American Sociological Association	fla		Changes since 1940 in the rates and patterns of labor force participation of married women are examined using retrospective work histories of wives taken from the 1960 Growth of American Families Study. The effects of certain predictor variables, such as income of the husband, wage potential of the wife and number of children under six, on the probability of a woman working are determined for life cycle stages. Changes since 1940 in the effects of these predictors are examined using a single-equation, additive linear model and analysis of covariance techniques. The major hypothesis tested in this research is that significant changes have occurred since 1940 in the effects of the factors influencing working by wives. The research supports this hypothesis for the early stages of marriage and childbearing only. No changes in either probability of work activity between births or the effects of all predictors when these are considered together on this activity are found for wives with three or more children. When each causal variable is considered separately, a significant decrease is noted in the effects of those factors which tend to inhibit wives' working. Among these are the presence of children under six, the age of the wife and her educational level. The factors which tend to facilitate working, past labor force activity and wife's earning power, have tended to increase in effect or have remained strongly positive influences.

Focusing initially on a randomly selected sample of free riders from the TMI area, we first investigate the extent of, and reasons for, this phenomenon. Free riding in an actual mobilization process is revealed to be more widespread than Olson's critics suggest, and also more complex than Olson alleged. We then compare the most politically active citizens in the TMI area with the free riders on solidarity, ideology, grievance, and other dimensions in an attempt to discern the most important correlates of social movement involvement. The paper concludes with a model which synthesizes the resource mobilization and alternative perspectives.

Yet the application of such measures to the study of consensus remains undeveloped. Simple measures may be elaborated that lend themselves to analyses which are conceptually complex. These measures are particularly suited to some forms of content analytic data.

We conceptualize landed corporate executives and principal owners of capital and their non-landed counterparts in the largest corporations as distinct "class segments"; and we analyze their comparative officeholding in parliament and cabinet ministries and in the leadership of the political parties of the Right, as well as the officeholding of their fathers and others in their immediate families. The findings consistently show that the landed segment played a distinctive role in the political leadership of the capitalist class. The problem of the "coalescence" of agrarian property and corporate capital as a self-contradictory class situation and its relevance for state policy is posed for further analysis.

In contrast to previous research, this study assumes that the effect of democracy will be incremental and, therefore, that the historical experience of democracy must be considered rather than the current political situation. Two hypotheses are suggested: that democracy itself will lead to equality and that only the election of socialist legislatures will lead to equality. The historical experience of democracy and that of socialist legislatures is related to five measures of inequality. It is concluded, after taking into account the level of economic development and the growth rate, that although democracy itself has little effect, the experience of democratic socialist parties is significantly related to variations in inequality. The stronger the democratic socialist parties, the more egalitarian is the contemporary class system.

However, exchange theory has focused largely upon analysis of the dyad, while power and justice are fundamentally social structural phenomena. First, we contrast economic with sociological analysis of dyadic exchange. We conclude that (a) power and equity from social exchange theory carry us beyond economic theory of dyadic exchange; yet (b) for power and equity to be studied effectively, analysis of systems larger than the dyad is needed. Second, we introduce exchange networks to extend power and equity analysis into more macroscopic n-person social structures. Third, a laboratory method is reported for controlled study of exchange networks as bargaining structures. Finally, we present findings which show that (a) power is an attribute of position in a network structure observable in the occupant's behavior, even though the occupant does not know what position or what amount of power s/he possesses; (b) equity or justice concerns constrain the use of that power; (c) emergent interpersonal commitments impede the use of power; and (d) when power is unequally distributed among actors in a network, females form stronger commitments to their exchange partners than do males. In conclusion, we discuss the importance of commitment in distinguishing between economic and social exchange theory.

Using a model of the distribution of citations among the members of a field, we show that a higher field growth rate increases seniority-specific citation rates for individual scientists, and also increases the degree of inequality in the citation rates for the field as a whole. The citation of recent rather than older work reduces such inequality by discounting the older contributions of senior members of a field. Failure to take such effects into account may lead to erroneous conclusions in comparative analyses of inequality among scientific fields. We also argue that comparative analyses of other forms of inequality, such as cross-national analyses of inequality in income and wealth, are affected by structural variables analogous to those that operate in science.

Determinants of these perceptions suggested by three alternative hypotheses in this area are reviewed and their effects compared empirically. The data come from a longitudinal study of adult male Cuban exiles interviewed at the time of arrival in the United States and again three and six years later. Results suggest a significant rise in perceptions of social distance and discrimination from low initial levels and a consistent association of such perceptions with variables suggested by the ethnic resilience perspective. In particular, findings from a series of logistic regressions converge with recent events in South Florida to demonstrate the significance of interethnic contact and competition in the development of ethnic awareness. Theoretical implications of these results and their bearing on the analysis of differences between labor immigrants and political refugees are discussed.

When the existing theory is insufficient to make all the relevant parameters of a statistical model identified, we often introduce dubious assumptions to make the model identifiable. In a similar way, when the variables under examination do not meet the measurement levels required by the statistical model, we sometimes pretend as if they do. As a means of evaluating the extent to which the parameter estimates are sensitive to such potential errors in model specification and data, a new approach to sensitivity analysis is proposed. The sensitivity index, which is the key to the new approach, has been widely used in different disciplines under a variety of different names.

Dickinson	American Sociological Review	40	3	1975-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 279-297	American Sociological Association	fla		In a reanalysis of trend data on occupational mobility among men in the United States, we define ways in which movement among occupation groups across generations might be constant even when the occupational structure is changing. Our analysis suggests that no change has taken place in occupational mobility (as specified by our definition). Rather, the changing occupational distribution is the major factor affecting patterns of intergenerational occupational mobility. This implies the possibility of constructing occupational mobility tables for times when the age-specific occupation distribution is known, but no mobility survey has been carried out. Moreover, rather than treating the underlying process of mobility as a variable in comparative research and the variation in the distribution of occupations as a disturbance, it may be more fruitful to treat transformations of the occupational structure as problematic in comparative mobility research.

D'Amico	American Sociological Review	42	6	1977-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 937-950	American Sociological Association	fla		The empirical and theoretical analysis of intercity variation in black-white occupational differences constitutes a thin but persistent thread running through the last 30 years of sociological literature. At least nine separate statistical analyses have been reported in major sociological journals from 1951 to 1976, starting with Turner's (1951) attempt to test "some hypotheses frequently found in the race relations literature" concerning the relative occupational position of the Negro male in the labor forces of large American cities. This paper reassesses this entire literature on theoretical, methodological and empirical grounds. Our strategy here is to ask some key, underlying questions which never have been considered by earlier empirical studies of city differences in the race-occupation relationship. We find unexpected answers to these questions and these answers lead us to reexamine the dominant methodology of previous studies of the relative occupational standing of blacks and whites in U.S. metropolitan areas. In our methodological reexamination of earlier studies, we ask some additional basic, underlying questions which have not been considered in previous research, and the answers we find enable us to explain exactly how certain methodological conventions in this literature misled earlier researchers. As a further validation of our methodological arguments, and for theoretical reasons developed in this paper, we also investigate intermetropolitan variation in gender differences in occupational distribution. Finally, we draw upon recent theoretical and empirical research on the social evaluation of occupations to derive a theoretical explanation of why sexual differentiation and racial differentiation in the occupational structure does not vary substantially across U.S. metropolitan areas.

Guiot	American Sociological Review	42	5	1977-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 692-704	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper presents a tentative theoretical framework for investigating the process of identity construction. It is suggested that, at any given time, the perceiver's construction of the other's identity may be characterized by either one of two inferential perspectives. "Viewing the other qua performer" involves the attribution of role-relevant qualities on the basis of observing behavior as role performance. "Viewing the other qua person" entails the linking of observed behavior to psychological causes which have their origin in the other's personality. When the identity-construction process is envisaged in the particular case where the other is a stranger to the perceiver, an initial branching is postulated. This branching is constituted of two inferential paths (corresponding to the two inferential perspectives) potentially open to the perceiver in his construction of the other's identity. Several factors that may be invoked to account for, or to predict the nature of the perceiver's inferential activity are discussed; these include: the perceiver's needs and objectives, his expectancies concerning the likelihood of events to be encountered, his preference for certain cues in making inferences, the consequences implied by alternative categorizations and their relative value to the perceiver, the need for adjusting to situational requirements, and the kind of cues exhibited.

Andrews	American Sociological Review	45	3	1980-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 448-462	American Sociological Association	fla		The paper reviews a series of examinations of three key principles of differential association: the contingency principle, the socioemotional principle, and the principle that criminal acts occur as a function of an excess of definitions favorable to violation of the law. The studies sampled a variety of correctional clients in a variety of correctional settings and in each there were explicit attempts to exert direct experimental control over the factors of theoretical interest as well as competing factors. In total, the findings support both the causal and the practical significance of differential association while documenting (a) structural effects on the contingencies within the service system, and (b) the effects of those contingencies on the criminal attitudes and behavior of individuals. The discussion critically contrasts such systematic testing of assumptions with related programs which have been operating for years with limited theoretical and practical returns. The paper suggests, in total, that systematic program evaluation provides the tools--and the opportunity--for a bridging of the gaps between general sociology and general psychology and between social science theory and social service.

A method used to obtain estimates of the effects of these variables involves the assumption of additivity and the imposition of one or more constraints on the relative effects of particular age levels, periods, or cohorts. This method can rarely if ever be justified for three reasons: first, the possibility of interactive effects cannot be ruled out a priori; second, although a constraint on the relationship of two groups may appear appropriate on a priori grounds, even small errors in the specification can have large effects on the estimates; and third, measurement error can lead to highly inaccurate estimates even if the constraint is precisely correct. A solution to the dilemma lies in the specification and measurement of the theoretical variables for which age, period, and cohort are indirect indicators.

Black professionals and managers lived in tracts with an occupational composition comparable, on the average, to that of tracts where unskilled white workers lived. The neighbors of white high school drop-outs had educational backgrounds similar to those of black college graduates. Black families with incomes over $25,000 lived in poorer tracts than white families with incomes below $3,000. In comparisons of whites and blacks on any variable affected by neighborhood composition, therefore, control for individual characteristics does not eliminate the effects of differential neighborhood characteristics.

Ridgeway	American Sociological Review	46	3	1981-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 333-347	American Sociological Association	fla		The impact of conformity and nonconformity on influence in task groups is still uncertain. This paper presents a test of the author's recent theory (Ridgeway, 1978) which reconciles the conflicting findings in the area and contrasts it with a test of the currently accepted theory (Hollander, 1958, 1960). Hollander argues that prior conformity enhances status which allows greater influence and nonconformity. The author argues that status and influence result from external status characteristics, task competence, and perceived motivation towards the group. Conformity and nonconformity affect influence through the clues they offer to two of these, motivation and competence. Data from 96 experimental decision groups, each composed of three male subjects and a male or female confederate, failed to confirm Hollander's approach and largely supported the author's. Results indicate that nonconformity which accompanies a task contribution often enhances the influence of an external-status equal, but can have liabilities for members with low external status.

This paper continues the work of Fararo (1981) in providing a formal linkage between these two levels using the concepts of biased net theory. The application provides versions of Blau's major theorems that uncover implications not readily apparent from his verbal presentation, permits the extension of his theory beyond characteristics along which preferences for ingroup association exist to ones along which preferences for outgroup association may exist (and ones even stranger where both preference types may exist), demonstrates the theoretical basis for some negative results of recent research (Blau et al., 1982), and offers a rigorous basis for a general formal theory of social structure's influences on people's associations with one another.

In this paper, we examine the sequence and time interval between these two events: age at first marriage and age at the birth of first child. We first present a general conceptual framework for the study of the determinants of early family formation. Then within this framework, we empirically examine the effects of educational attainment and urban/rural origins upon the timing of first marriage and first birth among women in four Asian societies. We find some common patterns of family formation that lend modest support to Goode's convergence thesis, but there are also significant unexplained interpopulation differences.

Ratcliff	American Sociological Review	45	4	1980-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 553-570	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper analyzes the lending patterns of commercial banks in a major metropolitan area. The banks are studied in terms of their ties, through the members of their boards of directors, to networks of economic power and upper class social interaction within the metropolitan structure of the capitalist class. The central research question concerns whether the extent of a bank's centrality to these networks substantially influences the decisions made by each bank regarding the allocation of the capital it commands. While attempting to consider the broader social consequences of private economic power, the paper addresses three problems found in many recent studies of interlocking directorates: the general lack of attention paid to questions of social consequences as opposed to issues of structure; conceptual confusions central to explanations that focus on notions of "cooptation"; and the omission of measures on the dimension of economic power. The empirical analysis, dealing with the impact of class structure, economic power and institutional size measures upon the distribution of bank loan capital, reveals that the main determinants of lending are the class structure characteristics of banks as these are reflected in the network linkages of their boards of directors. In particular, banks whose directors are tied to numerous local corporations which represent major concentrations of economic power and, to a lesser extent, to the most exclusive upper class social circles are those most likely to emphasize concentrated lending to capitalist borrowers and, correspondingly, most likely to withhold capital from mortgage loans. It is also shown that these differences in lending behavior are not related to the profitability of the banks themselves. It is argued that these patterns are best explained by a model of capitalist class coordination in which dominant groups exercise their abilities to influence banks and corporations in ways that benefit their interests. These findings are examined in terms of the general economic stagnation and even decline of older urban areas.

Hypotheses are generally confirmed on the basis of interpretations of leader-follower and helper-helped dialogues by 688 college students using alternate questionnaire forms in a quasi-experimental design. Hypotheses are tested under three conditions of group- and role-designation. Possible effects of role-adequacy judgments and variant role standpoints on role attribution are explored in a preliminary fashion.

Three concepts of ways in which shifts in the distributions of social origins and destinations can result in changes in the total rate of mobility-"discrepancy effects," "concentration effects," and "composition effects"-are discussed and shown to be represented in a multiplicative model commonly applied to mobility tables. By observing the changes in the expected percentage mobile when various constraints are added to this multiplicative model, the relative impact of each aspect of structural change becomes more apparent. Most of the change in Hungary, particularly between 1953 and 1973, is attributable to changes in structural constraints. Most of the change in mobility across economic classes was associated with changing origin-destination discrepancy effects, as were large portions of the changes in mobility across socioeconomic status levels and broad social strata. Changing concentration effects were less important, and mostly affected mobility across SES levels. Detailed composition effects were most important in conjunction with monotonic increases in mobility across SES levels.

Mean labor market conditions and labor force characteristics show inconsistent patterns of difference between sectors across the different taxonomies and do not support hypothesized sectoral differences. Income attainment and poverty earnings within sectors are consistently related to labor market conditions, but labor force characteristics show a much less consistent pattern across taxonomies. Only one of the four taxonomies produces overall significant differences between sectors (for predicting earnings only). Generally, the four taxonomies produce inconsistent patterns of results and show a mixed pattern of support for dual economy predictions.

We contend that the Parsonian interpretation is erroneous both in many of its particulars and in the general cast that it gives to Weber's theoretical product. The crux of Parsons' misrepresentation is his overweening emphasis on the category of the normative. A confusion of "factual regularities" with "normative validity"--despite Weber's numerous warnings against such--led Parsons to an exaggeration of the importance Weber assigned to normative orientations of social action, legitimacy and collectivity integration, and, correspondingly, to a severe understatement of the importance of nonnormative aspects of social action and structures of dominance. In consequence, Parsons expanded what was but a part of Weber's sociology and made it very nearly the whole.

Tolbert II	American Sociological Review	43	5	1978-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 704-720	American Sociological Association	fla		We examine the importance of industrial sectors as hypothesized by the dual economy literature on the process of earnings determination. Using NORC survey data, we find substantively and statistically significant differences in labor force composition and economic status between core and periphery industrial sectors. Our application of a covariance regression model to these data demonstrates that the sectoral differentials in earnings cannot be explained away by differences in labor force composition and that there exist significant sectoral variations in the way that worker characteristics are rewarded. The findings are interpreted as evidence of the importance of structural factors for earnings determination. The critical implications of such findings for neoclassical research traditions in social stratification are noted.

However, recent investigations of French work stoppages assign more importance to organizational and political than to economic determinants of strike activity. These apparent contradictory results and conclusions are ignored by previous work, almost all of which examines a single country and/or limited time span. In this paper, we argue that existing findings differ according to the institutional context of labor relations. Specifically, we identify assumptions underlying each line of argument; argue that the extent to which these assumptions hold influences results and conclusions of various analyses; and show that each set of assumptions holds best within different types of institutional setting. We test this argument with regression analyses of yearly timeseries data for France (1876-1966), Italy (1901-1970) and the United States (1900-1970). Results of these analyses correspond to our hypotheses concerning the influence of institutional setting on fluctuations in aggregate strike activity. We then consider implications of these findings for investigations of other forms of collective protest.

For the 11% of executions imposed for rape, discrimination against black defendants who had raped white victims was substantial, but only in the South. Evidence for noncapital sentencing also largely contradicts a hypothesis of overt discrimination against black defendants. Although black offender--white victim crimes are generally punished more severely than crimes involving other racial combinations, this appears to be due to legally relevant factors related to such offenses. Crimes with black victims, however, are less likely than those with white victims to result in imposition of the death penalty. The devalued status of black crime victims is one of several hypothetical explanations of the more lenient sentencing of black defendants.

LaFree	American Sociological Review	45	5	1980-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 842-854	American Sociological Association	fla		Collins argues that sexual access, like other valuable commodities, is distributed according to relative power within a sexual stratification system. He predicts more serious official reactions to violations of the sexual stratification system in which men from less powerful groups sexually assault women from more powerful groups. Race continues to be an obvious correlate of stratified sexual access in America. But empirical studies have not assessed the cumulative effect of racial composition of victim-suspect dyads on processing outcomes in sexual assault cases. The present study examined the effect of race composition on processing decisions--from case report to final disposition--for 881 sexual assaults in a large, midwestern city. Step-wise multiple regression analysis showed that, compared to other defendants, black men who assaulted white women received (1) more serious charges and (2) longer sentences, and were more likely to (3) have their cases filed as felonies, (4) receive executed sentences, and (5) be incarcerated in the state penitentiary. At the same time, black men who assaulted white women were no more likely than other suspects to be arrested or found guilty. The implications of the results for a sexual stratification theory of official reactions to sexual assault are discussed.

Lantz, Jane Keyes, Martin Schultz	American Sociological Review	40	1	1975-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 21-36	American Sociological Association	fla		This research parallels two earlier investigations of preindustrial American family patterns during the periods of 1741-1794 and 1794-1825. The present investigation involves a content analysis of magazines for the third period, 1825-1850. Special attention is given to power patterns between husband and wife, romantic love, motivations for marriage, and advocated and actual sanctions implemented toward individuals involved in premarital and extramarital sexual relationships. The results suggest a marked increase in the power of the woman. Romantic love and personal happiness emerge as important criteria in mate selection. It is suggested that in the period 1825-1850 magazine content indicates a significant move from a traditional to a more emancipated family with new alternatives. The limitations of these findings are discussed and include the problem of identifying the precise period in which industrialization in America emerged, the implications which this difficulty poses for the interpretation of our data. The special problems of causal analysis in understanding family change are also noted.

Current evidence is limited largely to case studies. Analytically, two types of change underlie aggregate variations in skill requirements: change in the distribution of workers in jobs and actual change in the content of jobs. Recent research for the first type of change in the American economy suggests a modest skill downgrading since 1900. Using data from two consecutive editions of the Dictionary of Occupational Titles for a sample of jobs, I present new evidence that shows small variations for the second type of change for the last 10-12 years. There has been a slight upgrading in skill requirements in several sectors of the labor force.

The study demonstrates that central learning concepts are amenable to questionnaire measurement, and the findings indicate that social learning theory will do well when tested with other forms of deviant behavior.

Johnson	American Sociological Review	40	6	1975-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 785-800	American Sociological Association	fla		The relationship between socioeconomic status and frequency of religious participation is examined for a 1970 U.S. sample of males and females. Although some support is found for the frequently observed positive relationship between these two variables, the data require that such a generalization be qualified. The zero-order relationship generally is stronger for males than females and is positive and weak for Protestants, but is essentially zero for Catholics and negative in sign for Jews and unaffiliated whites. Where the relationship is positive, it is not entirely explainable by the positive relationship of our measure of general social participation with both SES and religious participation. In addition, the examination of interactions with marital status and the presence of children under age 16 indicated that the SES-religious participation relationship is strongest for those who are married and responsible for young children. Even with these significant variations by relevant subpopulations, we conclude that the explanatory power of socioeconomic status in predicting religious participation is small both in absolute terms and in comparison with other possible determinants examined.

Recent research, however, points to the inadequacy of such models. This paper develops an alternative model which explains inter-country differences in inequality as a consequence of the relation of states to the world-economy. This model posits that inter-country differences in inequality are partially a result of the degree of economic dominance and influence that states, and the economic actors within them, exercise in the world-economy. Three mechanisms of this economic dominance and influence are identified: state strength, direct foreign financial control and dependence on external markets. A cross-sectional regression analysis shows that indicators of these three mechanisms do have the hypothesized effects on the degree of inequality within countries. The results suggest the importance of considering the position of states within the world-economy as a cause of inter-country differences in inequality.

Thoits	American Sociological Review	48	2	1983-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 174-187	American Sociological Association	fla		Drawing upon symbolic interactionist theory, this paper reconceptualizes social isolation as the possession of few social identities. Social identities (enacted in role relationships) give meaning and guidance to behavior, and thus should prevent anxiety, depression, and disordered conduct. The "identity accumulation hypothesis"--the more identities possessed by an actor, the less psychological distress he/she should exhibit--is tested and supported using panel data from the New Haven community survey (Myers et al., 1971). The interaction between identity accumulation and identity change is also examined, under differing assumptions regarding the structure of multiple identities. Results indicate that integrated individuals benefit more from identity gain and also suffer more from identity loss than isolated individuals. The implications of these results for social isolation theory and for previous conceptions of the effects of multiple roles are discussed.

Peterson, John Hagan	American Sociological Review	49	1	1984-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 56-70	American Sociological Association	fla		Theories based on static and simplistic conceptions of the social significance of race fail to account for anomalous research findings and confuse our understanding of race-related outcomes. To substantiate this argument, an analysis is presented of the effects of changing conceptions of race and drugs on sentencing outcomes during a modern anti-drug crusade. This crusade involved a compromise between conservative and liberal impulses in which "big dealers" were identified as villains, while middle-class youth and nonwhites (but the latter only insofar as they were rarely big dealers in a racially stratified drug trade) were reconceived as victims. The results of our contextualized analysis allow us to make sense of otherwise anomalous findings and suggest that while there may be a trend toward equality in American criminal sentencing, there are also patterns of differential leniency and severity that can only be revealed when changing conceptions of race and crime are taken into account.

Williams	American Sociological Review	45	1	1980-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 33-48	American Sociological Association	fla		Using the idea of "embourgeoisment," as it appears in stratification literature, that working-class people are increasingly adopting middle-class values and behaviors, this paper examines changes in the relationship between social class and sexual behavior over the last thirty years. Comparing data collected in 1938-63 with data collected in 1969-70, we find the following: For males, there are now similarities between the working and middle classes with regard to the incidence of various sexual activities, but differences exist for age at first experience, number of opposite sex partners, and the incidences and frequencies of adolescent sexual activities. For females, there were similarities between classes in the past, but now we find differences between the two classes regarding age at first experience, reactions to first experiences, and the incidences and frequencies of adolescent sexual activities. We have concluded that these findings offer little support for the idea that the sexual patterns of the classes have become indistinct. Social class is still seen as an important determinant of sexual behavior.

Ordering patterns are distributed on a scale of the degree of conformity with the normative ordering of events. Major determinants of ordering patterns are identified. While family background is of limited importance for the ordering of events in the life cycle, the manner in which a man spends the years of late adolescence and early adulthood is of critical relevance. College attendance delays marriage, but not by a sufficient amount of time to prevent substantial numbers of men from marrying prior to completing their schooling. Military service is a major disruptive factor in the life courses of men, although the effects of service in the peacetime army have been less deleterious since men have some discretion in its timing. The unique histories of birth cohorts that result from the age-specific conjunction of period events is a crucial exogenous factor in the life course of men. Men for whom the ordering of events is deviant experience higher rates of marital disruption than do other men. This supports the hypothesis that the variable ordering of events in the life course is a contingency of some importance in the life cycle.

Wasserman	American Sociological Review	48	5	1983-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 711-720	American Sociological Association	fla		Recent works by Phillips and Feldman, and Boor have shown that mortality and suicide rates drop significantly during presidential elections, a phenomenon the previous authors titled the presidential death dip. This work argues that the previous studies are flawed both methodologically and theoretically. By comparing suicide and mortality rates in presidential election years with rates in adjacent years the studies fail to examine all the information in their data set, and consequently are unable to control for other relevant variables. In particular, other studies have shown that the unemployment rate is significantly related to the suicide and mortality rates, and the rate of unemployment tends to be relatively low in September and October of presidential election years. Employing monthly suicide and mortality data between 1903 and 1977, and using multivariate time-series analysis, it is found that when variations in the unemployment rate are controlled no significant relationship exists between presidential elections and suicide and mortality rates. The results of this study demonstrate that the presidential death-dip hypothesis is incorrect.

Moore	American Sociological Review	44	5	1979-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 784-815	American Sociological Association	fla		Early childbearing has been assumed to result in numerous social and economic problems, including school drop-out, large families, and poverty. However, few studies have been conducted within a multivariate, nonrecursive framework, and researchers have not traced the causal and cumulative effects of an early first birth. Using data from the National Longitudinal Surveys of young women on a subsample of women who have borne a child by age 27, we find strong direct effects within a path analytic framework, such that later childbearers complete more education, have smaller families, and work fewer hours at age 27. The relationship with education is recursive among women having a first child by age 18, but simultaneous among later childbearers. Effects of age at first birth on economic well-being at 27 are indirect. Lower education is related to reduced earnings among women and among other household members (usually the husband). Since resources must be divided among more family members, the incidence of poverty is greater. For women who are at least 19 when they have their first birth, the timing of that birth is important to later well-being primarily because of the smaller families and increased work experience of those who postpone their first birth into the twenties. Having an early first birth was found to be less detrimental to the later economic well-being of black women than white women.

Robert Wuthnow	American Sociological Review	41	5	1976-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 850-867	American Sociological Association	fla		A "generation unit" theory derived from Mannheim's discussion is developed as an explanation of irregularity in the secularization process. This approach indicates that distinct shifts in religious trends may be the result of age strata attempting to differentiate themselves symbolically from some other age strata. Applying this approach to recent patterns of secularization suggests that the so-called counterculture of the late 1960s may have been an important source of the shifts evident in religious trends. Tests of five derivative hypotheses using a variety of data sets lend support to this interpretation. Other instances of dramatic fluctuation in religious patterns that may be understandable as generational phenomena are suggested.

To justify their actions, organizations create problems, successes, threats and opportunities. These are ideological molecules that mix values, goals, expectations, perceptions, theories, plans, and symbols. The molecules form while people are result watching, guided by the beliefs that they should judge results good or bad, look for the causes of results, and propose needs for action. Because organizations modify their behavior programs mainly in small increments that make sense to top managers, they change too little and inappropriately, and nearly all organizations disappear within a few years.

These analysts also maintain that disorganization increases discontent. "Solidarity theorists," on the other hand, argue that isolated individuals are less likely to protest than others and that discontent is unrelated to protest. Data from a survey of Boston residents provide support for the solidarity theorists' argument that social cohesion increases protest. The Boston data, however, support the breakdown theorists' hypothesis that discontented individuals are more likely to protest than others. Finally, the data undercut the breakdown theorists' hypothesis that disorganization increases discontent.

A fifth experiment, developed to test this theory, provides partial confirmation but also evidence that the norm can create effects in one direction only. In addition, a sixth experiment is reviewed which emphasizes the fact that a presumed need for psychological consistency is too vague a description of the forces at work. Only where consistency receives normative definition and direction does the context effect occur. Finally, an attempt is made to specify types of persons most susceptible to the context effect, but further evidence will be needed in order to achieve more complete understanding on this point.

A further aim of this research was the inspection of the Parsons and Bales proposition of complementarity of expressive and instrumental specialization. The results indicated that while women were strongly committed to expressive activities during the infancy of their children, the intensity of this commitment decreased substantially in early childhood. Males, while relatively less involved in expressive activities, still assumed a substantial portion of the expressive functions of the family, and maintained the level of this commitment throughout the infancy and early childhood of their offspring. A moderate level of male-female expressive complementarity was found in the infant caregiving activities; beyond infancy, however, the complementary relationship disappeared completely. Finally, no evidence was found to support a principle of complementary expressive-instrumental specialization in the family.

Marks	American Sociological Review	42	6	1977-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 921-936	American Sociological Association	fla		Sociologists generally invoke a natural "scarcity" approach to human energy, stressing the overdemanding nature of multiple roles. In contrast, a seldom used "expansion" approach provides an energy-creation theory of multiple roles rather than a "spending" or "drain" theory. Empirical literature only partially supports the scarcity approach view that multiple roles inevitably create "strain." Moreover, human physiology implies that human activity produces as well as consumes energy. We need a comprehensive theory that explains both the scarcity and the abundance phenomenology of energy. Such a theory requires careful analytical distinctions between time, energy, and commitments. It is argued that particular types of commitment systems are responsible for whether or not strain will occur. A theory of scarcity excuses explains how strain or overload is generally rooted in one such system. Scarcity excuses get implicit support from scarcity theories, and a sociology of these theories suggests their ideological basis.

Rosenfeld	American Sociological Review	45	4	1980-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 583-609	American Sociological Association	fla		In this paper, career differences by race and sex are analyzed. Careers are defined as trajectories of socioeconomic status and wages and are described by a linear differential equation model. It is assumed that the different groups defined by race and sex tend to be in different labor markets and economic sectors and to face different opportunity structures even within labor market divisions. This assumption guides predictions for and interpretation of results with respect to various aspects of career inequality: initial status and wage level; potential status and wage levels; effects of human capital, family background, and family of procreation variables on initial and potential wage and status levels; speed of advancement. Pooling of cross-sections and time-series techniques are used to estimate the model, with data from the National Longitudinal Surveys of the Labor Market Experience of Young Men and Women.

Cutright finds a negative effect of democratization on inequality, while Jackman finds no effect. In this paper, we reanalyze and extend these analyses. We consider five issues and our findings are the following: (1) the two different indexes of democratization used are not the likely cause of the discrepant findings; (2) the different samples are not the likely cause; (3) the probable cause of the different results seems to be in the data used or coding procedures that Cutright and Jackman employed in constructing their measure of sectoral income inequality; (4) substituting personal income for sectoral income in the analysis, we find that both the Cutright and Jackman indexes have negative effects on inequality; (5) we test the alternative specification which hypothesizes that inequality has a negative effect on democratization, and then test these two different hypotheses. This analysis supports the hypothesis that inequality has a negative effect on democratization, but there is less empirical support for the original hypothesis that democratization negatively affects inequality.

Smith	American Sociological Review	43	5	1978-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 643-656	American Sociological Association	fla		Thirty-five studies examining the relationship between social class and crime/delinquency are reduced to comparable statistics using instances where the relationship was studied for specific categories of age, sex, race, place of residence, data type, or offense as units of analysis. The findings from 363 instances are summarized and patterns are identified. The overall results show only a slight negative relationship between class and criminality, with self-report studies reflecting lower associations than official statistics studies. Moreover, analysis demonstrates a clear historical decline in magnitude of association to the point where both self-report and official statistics studies done in the current decade find no class variation. This historical trend is shown to be due to changes in the findings from studies using official statistics as indicators of criminality. Alternative interpretations are discussed, but all lead to serious doubts about the adequacy of theories of deviance that contain assumptions of class differences.

The effects are examined in a representative sample of persons who won between $500 and $100,000 in state lotteries. Following an incubation period of over one year, it is found that the magnitude of winnings are positively related to gratification permissiveness and inversely related to future aspirations. However, both of these immediate effects tend to be anomia-reducing, a finding which seems contrary to Durkheim's affluence thesis. The findings are interpreted in relation to changes in normative structures, and it is proposed that such changes alter the meaning of anomia as a personal-level indicator of a state of anomie in society.

The first, based on a developmental perspective, argues that there is a high degree of regional uniformity in party support in Britain. The second, based on the theory of reactive ethnic cleavages, supports the view that Celtic political distinctiveness is a persistent feature of British politics. Both perspectives are found to be inadequate because of errors in conceptualization and design. One such error is the assumption that class affinity and status-group affinity as bases for political action are mutually exclusive orientations. Supporters of both perspectives argue that the predominance of class implies that status affinity is relatively unimportant and vice versa. A serious design defect concerns vote dichotomization; typically, researchers have examined the votes for only a single party. This paper demonstrates that the analysis of Conservative votes supports the theory of reactive ethnic cleavages, while the analysis of Labour votes supports the developmental perspective. Together, these findings support a third argument--that in economically peripheral areas, an appeal to regional or "ethnic" interests by the local dominant strata may be provoked by local class cleavages.

The model is obtained from positing the notion of structural control. The necessary procedures for estimating the model are developed and applied to data from a panel study of bureaucracies. The model addresses Blau's formal theory of differentiation and both modifies and extends that theory. The relationship between size variables and differentiation variables is more complex than Blau's theory suggests. Moreover, some mechanisms of change are more important than others and this relative importance is detected in the model.

Stolzenberg	American Sociological Review	43	6	1978-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 813-828	American Sociological Association	fla		Employers play a crucial role in the process of social stratification in the U.S.: the jobs they provide are the primary mechanism by which individuals are distributed among occupations and by which earnings are distributed among persons. But the vast majority of sociological work on socioeconomic achievement ignores employers completely, and nearly all related work by economists either ignores employers or else ignores characteristics of workers, substituting one omission for another. In the theoretical section of this paper, we review and combine sociological work on organizational structure, sociological studies of social stratification, and economic research on labor markets, industrial wage differentials and human capital. In this review, we hypothesize that the size of an employer organization works indirectly through other dimensions of organizational structure to alter the effect of workers' schooling on their wages and occupational attainment. In particular, we hypothesize that the effect of workers' schooling on earnings and the effect of workers' schooling on occupational SES increase as logarithmic functions of the size of the organization which employs them. Since the relationship between schooling and occupational attainment is a central part of social stratification research, and because the effect of schooling on earnings is a fundamental feature of sociological and human capital research on earnings, this hypothesis links organizational structure to the very heart of current issues in social stratification and human capital studies. In the empirical section of the paper, we divide a national probability sample of workers into five groups, depending on the size of the establishment in which they work. Fitting models of earnings and occupational attainment in each of these groups and then relating schooling effects to the size of the establishment which defines the groups, we find that the effect of workers' schooling on earnings and SES increases approximately as a logarithmic function of the size of the establishment for which they work. Indeed, we find zero-order correlations between schooling effects and log establishment size to be between +.88 and +.95, and statistically significant at the .025 level or better. Implications of our research are discussed.

It is argued that one must separate stayers and movers when studying career mobility. Data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Older Men and from the March 1981 Current Population Survey are employed. Two industrial sector models are tested, and are compared with a blue-collar vs. white-collar dichotomy. Industrial sector is shown to have only a modest impact on career mobility: Industrial sector is no more important for blacks and women than for white men. For all groups, collar color inhibits career mobility significantly more than does industrial sector.

DuBick	American Sociological Review	42	5	1977-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 756-768	American Sociological Association	fla		The major thesis of this paper is that macroanalyses of urban social organization have unduly exaggerated the importance of trade and commerce as the foundations of a division of labor among cities. This division of labor and the capacity of cities to influence each other differentially are examined as resting upon a convergence among fiscal-commercial activities, plus intellectual, cultural and organizational activities, and transportation and communication. This multifaceted conception of urban dominance stresses how different kinds of activities are associated with different geographical spheres of influence, resulting in three distinct types or dimensions of dominance: national-international, regional and local. Examination of U.S. cities in 1890 indicates two different functional and geographical distributions of regional and national dominance. They are associated with different patterns of regional integration and with variations in the economic development of regions. The types of dominance are also seen to exhibit substantial historical continuity between 1890 and 1970, with the multifaceted measure providing much better predictions than the financial measure.

Sørensen	American Sociological Review	40	4	1975-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 456-471	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper analyzes mobility rates for black and white men using life-history data on intragenerational mobility. Mobility is linked to the process of occupational achievement. It is argued that job mobility is generated by persons' attempts to maximize their status and income. Since opportunities for better jobs will be fewer the higher the occupational achievement already attained, the rate of mobility will depend on time in the labor force. The mathematical formulation of this time dependency is derived from a simple change model for the occupational achievement process. With this formulation, a redefinition of time is possible and job shifts in the redefined time scale can be described by a Poisson process. One component in the formulation of a realistic and theoretically meaningful stochastic model of mobility is then obtained. The empirical analysis indicates that the proposed model describes the observed change in mobility rates over time reasonably well.

Employment outside the home is associated with improved mental health among married women. Investigating the determinants of these effects shows that the mental health advantage of employment for women is due to objective changes in their life situations as they move out of the home and into the labor force. We have a less clear understanding of the relationship between spouse's employment and psychological distress among men, but inferential evidence suggests that traditional sex role orientations explain part of this effect. There is no evidence that objective burdens associated with increased housework or childcare responsibilities play a part in the elevated rates of distress reported by husbands. These conclusions are brought together in a discussion of trends in the relationship between sex and psychological distress.

Quadagno	American Sociological Review	49	5	1984-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 632-647	American Sociological Association	fla		A central concern of political theorists has been the relationship between the state and the economy, or more specifically, how political power gets translated into economic power. Recent debates have been shaped around critiques of the corporate liberal thesis, which contends that class-conscious capitalists manipulate the polity so that government comes to pursue policies favorable to capitalism. Alternative theories suggest that the state is capable of transcending the demands or interests of any particular social group or class. The Social Security Act of 1935, which represented the beginning of the welfare state in the United States, was a conservative measure that tied social insurance benefits to labor force participation and left administration of its public assistance programs to the states. In this paper the Social Security Act is used as a case study to adjudicate between several competing theories of the state. The analysis demonstrates that the state functions as a mediating body, weighing the priorities of various interest groups with unequal access to power, negotiating compromises between class factions, and incorporating working-class demands into legislation on capitalist terms.

Hindelang	American Sociological Review	44	1	1979-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 27-37	American Sociological Association	fla		Black's (1979) comment, when read in conjunction with The Behavior of Law (Black, 1976), raises several questions pertaining to the scientific adequacy of his theory of law. This paper assesses Black's theory against two criteria of scientific adequacy: generality and falsifiability. Black (1979) rejects our use of victimization survey data to test his theory because these data do not allow a comparison of that conduct initially labelled as crime and that conduct not so labelled. Our interest was not in this first-stage labelling, but in the second-stage decision by victims to increase the quantity of law by calling the police, given that the respondent had labelled some behavior as a crime. Black argues against such second-stage tests of his theory and also argues that his theory must be viewed as valid only with respect to the initial labelling of conduct as illegal; as a result, all labelling decisions predicated on the initial labelling decision are beyond the province of his theory. We also note that the basis of Black's (1979) restriction of the generality of his theory is inconsistent with his original statement of the theory (Black, 1976) in which he uses results from victimization surveys (of the same kind he now argues are irrelevant to the theory) to support his theory. In addition, Black's (1979) criteria for data sufficient to test his theory reduce the potential for testing his theory. Finally, we discuss some issues regarding conduct and its seriousness as they relate to Black's theory.

The paper is an effort to test empirically the implications of Goffman's (1961) general analysis of total institutions and Freidson's (1970) analysis of the social organization of illness within such contexts. These analyses argue that the institutional organization of being ill tends to reinforce patterns of illness behavior among clients by constraining the individual increasingly to adopt attitudes and behavior consistent with the assumption of the sick role. With data drawn from the 1971 Aging in Manitoba study (n = 4,805), an empirical test of this theory is presented by contrasting patterns of illness responses among the institutionalized and noninstitutionalized elderly. Specifically, the extent to which institutionalization alters the association between respondents' objective health status and respondents' self-definition of health status is analyzed. Contrary to the expectations of the theory, the results indicate that, given comparable levels of illness and disability, the institutionalized elderly are less likely to incorporate the illness label into their definition of self. In a subsequent section, the implications of these findings for the individual's overall level of life satisfaction also are identified and discussed.

Hogan	American Sociological Review	45	2	1980-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 261-276	American Sociological Association	fla		Individuals in American society tend to agree that it is normatively appropriate behavior to order the events marking the transition to adulthood so that formal schooling is completed first, and so that both school completion and beginning of first job occur prior to marriage. This paper reports on the testing of the hypothesis that men who order their transition events in a nonnormative fashion experience reduced occupational status and earnings returns in their later careers. The study is based on the responses of 18,370 ever-married white males aged 20 to 65, who were employed in the experienced civilian labor force, and were interviewed in the 1973 Occupational Changes in a Generation II survey. While no difference in occupational attainments are observed, men who experience a disorderly transition to adulthood also experience lower earnings returns to their education, as well as substantial deficits in their total earnings.

A sample of urban families residing in conditions ranging from open to highly compressed provided the data for the investigation, and multiple regression was used to analyze the influence of the crowding variables on family relations. Household congestion is found to have a small positive influence on the incidence of sibling quarrels and on the incidence with which parents struck their children. In general, however, crowding is found to have little or no effect on family relations.

McCann	American Sociological Review	42	1	1977-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 74-90	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper describes a procedure for analyzing tables of social mobility. The method is deduced from a few simple postulates relating to the mobility process. The major assumption is that sons may be ranked on a single dimension of status and that their occupational attainment is determined by their ranking on this dimension and by current labor needs. A priori specification of the general nature of the distribution of sons along this dimension is an operational requirement of the model. The procedures are applied to the intergenerational mobility tables of Britain and Denmark. The results show that, in large measure, the tendency of sons to take positions similar to those of their fathers can be accounted for without recourse to a principle of status inheritance. Another advantage of these procedures is that, within the framework of the model, they permit the effects on mobility of changing labor requirements to be separated from the effects due to the openness or fluidity of the social system.

It occurred at the time of the American Indian population nadir and had the objective of returning deceased Indian populations to life. Differential tribal participation in the Dance is analyzed as a result of the demographic characteristics-population change and size. Both were found important, though size had a stronger influence as virtually all smaller tribes participated. Size also mediated the impact of prior population changes on participation. Such demographic variables may have importance for the analysis of other nativistic movements, as well.

He defends an earlier statement of status-inconsistency theory (Lenski, 1954; 1956) against attacks on its coherence, and he provides a model which accurately represents the theory (and an equivalent theory of mobility effects) and may be used to test it. By contrast with this "diamond" model, he shows that the usual "square-additive" model cannot test for the presence of status inconsistency or mobility effects, whether these are defined additively or interactively. The technique of "design matrix regression analysis" is introduced as a means for exploring the relations between models in order to grasp their structure and implications before they are fitted to data. The square-additive model is criticized for its conceptual vagueness, but a theoretical position is suggested which incorporates the main positive feature of the model while constituting a worthy rival to inconsistency theory.

A cross-sectional analysis of 48 American states circa 1960 supports the propositions that large business corporations negatively affect governmental redistribution and that labor unions positively affect governmental redistribution. The analysis also supports past findings relating socioeconomic development, poverty, and the interaction of Democratic party strengths and cohesion and interparty competition to governmental redistribution. Findings suggest that redistribution to the poor by American state governments is a class issue, partially determined by conflicting class forces.

Robinson	American Sociological Review	49	2	1984-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 182-196	American Sociological Association	fla		Through an analysis of five capitalist societies, the reproduction of social relations of production from generation to generation and the role of education in this is found to depend on the type of class relation being reproduced. Relations of ownership of the means of production and the purchase of labor power, which are based on possession of physical capital, are reproduced directly from one generation to the next; education plays little role in the process either as a mediator of father's class or in its own right. Apparently capitalist and petty bourgeois fathers simply hand over the family business to their sons or provide them with investment capital to start their own businesses. Control over labor power, which is based on possession of education, knowledge, expertise, and skills rather than physical capital, is reproduced somewhat less directly in that there is some tendency for fathers who control labor power to ensure that their sons get more education which, in turn, enables the sons to acquire control positions themselves. Moreover, while education is generally irrelevant to acquiring ownership or purchasing labor power, it is an important factor, net of father's class, in obtaining control over labor power. Even the reproduction of control, however, is largely direct. Moreover, there is no tendency for education to assume a greater role in class reproduction or acquisition in the advanced industrial countries than in the Third World countries.

Bilingual French Canadians are rewarded, on the average, by placement into better occupations. The hypothesis is made that a similar reward exists for bilingualism in English in the Spanish mother tongue labor force in Puerto Rico. The 1970 Census of Population in Puerto Rico provides data for a test of this hypothesis in which the reward is demonstrated. It is also hypothesized that it is mainland American ownership of businesses which accounts for this reward. This hypothesis is tested on the labor force in manufacturing. It is not confirmed.

Bordua	American Sociological Review	45	2	1980-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 229-244	American Sociological Association	fla		A rationale for investigating subcultures of firearms ownership is developed. Two gun-owning populations are investigated by using survey data for the State of Illinois, those who own guns for sport and those who own guns for protection. Models of individual level gun ownership for sport and for protection are constructed and tested. Sporting gun ownership appears to be subcultural. Sporting gun ownership can be predicted by using family socialization variables and indicators of contact among members of the subculture, independent of situational variables. Protective ownership has none of the trappings of a subculture. It does not respond to family socialization and indicators of contact with other people who own guns for protection. Further, there is no indication of a subculture of violence among protective gun owners. Violent attitudes and behavior do not predict protective gun ownership. In fact, a situational variable (county violent crime) was the only predictor of gun ownership for protection. Further, gun ownership for protection and gun ownership for sport were found to be independent events, with no joint probability of occurrence. This suggests that the impetus for a subculture of protective ownership could not be a logical extension of a subculture of firearms ownership for sport.

At the same time, however, the discipline has failed to take advantage of applied sociological opportunities. To at least some extent, applied work could mitigate the consequences of the shrinking opportunities for sociologists in the academic labor market. In our view, however, there are qualitative differences between applied and conventional academic work that need to be confronted, including the educational preparation required, the criteria for student selection, the ways faculty are evaluated, and the kinds of work that are valued.

The outlines of a new paradigm are introduced, "the functional theory of deviant type-scripts," which suggest that everyday expectancies for deviance--which link types of actors to types of roles and which serve dominant social interests--at once account for our professional failure to include the sex variable in theories of criminal deviance and, more importantly, provide the single strongest theoretical account of the very striking cross-cultural difference in male and female criminality.

Hindelang	American Sociological Review	43	1	1978-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 93-109	American Sociological Association	fla		Most contemporary sociological theories of crime predict that blacks will be overrepresented among arrestees in common law personal crimes. These theories differ, however, in the extent to which this overrepresentation is attributed to disproportionate involvement in criminal offenses vs. criminal justice system selection biases. Studies that have relied upon official data have generally supported the differential involvement hypothesis, whereas studies relying on self-report techniques generally have supported the differential selection hypothesis. National victimization survey data on victims' reports of racial characteristics of offenders are introduced as a third measurement technique in order to shed additional light on this controversy. These data for rape, robbery, and assault, are generally consistent with official data on arrestees and support the differential involvement hypothesis. Some evidence of differential selection for criminal justice processing is found; however, most of the racial disproportionality in arrest data is shown by victimization survey data to be attributable to the substantially greater involvement of blacks in the common law personal crimes of rape, robbery, and assault. These results suggest that traditional admonitions against using arrest data as an index of involvement in these crimes may be overly cautious. In fact, the results imply that more caution should attend the use of self-report data in this vein and that more attention should be given to sampling and instrument concerns in self-report techniques. As currently used, the method may not be adequate for assessing the correlates of serious illegal conduct. The results also suggest that research emphasis be placed on those theories, such as the subcultural and differential opportunity perspectives, which attempt to explain differential racial involvement in these common law personal crimes.

However, our results also suggest that the effects are more complex than earlier quantitative research has shown.

Quadagno	American Sociological Review	44	1	1979-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 100-109	American Sociological Association	fla		One of the few theories in the history of ideas which has been held in common by both the social and natural sciences as well as philosophy is that of evolution. As a scientific paradigm evolutionary theory can be analyzed according to five principles: change, order, direction, progress and perfectibility. Darwinian evolutionary theory was based on the idea that change in forms occurs through the mechanism of natural selection. Darwin's central problem was to explain the apparent instability of species, which he observed in fossils. In contrast, the central problem of sociobiology has been to explain the evolution of social behaviors, including complex human social behaviors. A key issue has been the origin of altruism. In explaining the origins of social behavior, sociobiologists have altered the paradigm of evolutionary theory as originally formulated by Darwin in several ways. First, they have argued that the principal effect of natural selection must be the maximization of reproduction. Second, the concept of fitness has been altered; species typical behavior has come to be defined as fit behavior. Third, there has been an increased stress on the adaptive nature of behavior, with the subsequent effect that nonadaptive evolution has been ignored. Two specific examples of sociobiological reasoning which both purport to explain altruism, kin selection and reciprocal altruism, provide an example of tautological reasoning. In terms of both logic and method, sociobiology cannot be applied to the analysis of complex human social behavior. Sociobiology is based on a preconceived notion of change leading to a necessarily adaptive order in which the morality of human consciousness is replaced by the morality of gene survival.

Guterbock, Bruce London	American Sociological Review	48	4	1983-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 439-453	American Sociological Association	fla		Competing theories about differences between American blacks and whites in rates of political participation and joining of voluntary organizations are tested using data from a 1967 national sample survey. Prior literature offers four theories that seek to explain these differences: ethnic community theory, compensatory theory, isolation theory, and cultural inhibition theory. A typology of political orientations is developed, based on the underlying dimensions of political trust and political efficacy, and it is argued that the competing theories deal with the expected behavior of blacks with each of the four orientations thus defined. The theories are tested by computing expected mean participation rates for blacks of each orientational type and comparing these to the observed mean rates. The comparisons reveal whether participation rates for blacks with each orientation differ from those to be expected on the basis of their social class and demographic characteristics. The results give strong support to the ethnic community theory and clear counterevidence to the compensatory theory of black participation; the isolation and cultural inhibition theories receive virtually no support. Some broader theoretical implications of these results are suggested.

McLaughlin	American Sociological Review	43	6	1978-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 909-921	American Sociological Association	fla		Recent research on sex differences in the process of earnings attainment has relied heavily on occupational prestige or status as a determinant of male and female earnings. Utilizing occupational level data from the U.S. Census and the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, this paper presents evidence suggesting that the use of prestige may lead to misspecification when the earnings attainment of males and females is compared. The data reveal differences in the nature of the occupational task by occupational sex identification within levels of prestige. Since some of these task differences are shown to be income relevant, the task-based earning potential of male dominated occupations is higher than the earning potential of equally prestigious occupations dominated by females. Finally, after the effects of both prestige and the nature of the task have been controlled, the sex identification of the occupation is shown to have a substantial impact on male and female earnings.

It explores the early Paschal controversies within the context of the Church's attempts to establish its own unique identity as distinct from the Synagogue, claiming that the temporal segregation of Easter from its Jewish precursor was part of a general effort to emancipate the ecclesiastical calendar from the Jewish calendar and, thus, actually to promote the social segregation of Christians from Jews. The paper demonstrates that, as a symbolic system that is commonly shared by a group of people and is unique to them, the calendar accentuates the similitude among group members--thus solidifying their in-group sentiments--while, at the same time, contributing to the establishment of intergroup boundaries that distinguish, as well as separate, group members from "outsiders."

We ascertain the extent to which the sex gap in aspects of authority can be explained by the following three factors: (1) women's qualifications, (2) the behaviors and policies of employers, and (3) the attitudes and behaviors of women themselves. We find that while the amount of sex difference in aspects of authority that can be explained by women's qualifications is substantial, it is not the most important factor responsible for the restriction of women from positions of authority. Furthermore, strong evidence is presented that suggests that the behaviors and policies of employers are much more important causes of sexual differences in authority in the workplace than are the attitudes and behaviors of the women themselves.

We contend that the engine of rationalization and bureaucratization has moved from the competitive marketplace to the state and the professions. Once a set of organizations emerges as a field, a paradox arises: rational actors make their organizations increasingly similar as they try to change them. We describe three isomorphic processes--coercive, mimetic, and normative--leading to this outcome. We then specify hypotheses about the impact of resource centralization and dependency, goal ambiguity and technical uncertainty, and professionalization and structuration on isomorphic change. Finally, we suggest implications for theories of organizations and social change.

Randall Smith	American Sociological Review	48	3	1983-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 289-305	American Sociological Association	fla		The partitioning of the national labor market along a number of dimensions has recently been a topic of considerable interest. Less attention has been directed to the segmentation that occurs within submarkets or economic sectors. Yet the same forces that create sectors at the national level also segment internal labor markets bounded by occupations. The analysis of 1,741 job vacancy chains involving intercollegiate football and basketball coaches demonstrates that a core-periphery segmentation occurs within these occupational-internal labor markets. Jobs within the core of the market are more stable and individuals have greater chances for mobility. These results suggest that disaggregating the national labor market solely on the basis of occupation or economic variables is insufficient.

Chamlin	American Sociological Review	48	2	1983-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 240-247	American Sociological Association	fla		The issue of ethnic identity has received little attention in the empirical literature on ethnicity, despite its importance in the light of the currently high rates of intermarriage and mixed ancestry. In a preliminary way, we examine the variation of a skeletal form of ethnic identity: namely, ethnic identification, the individual's self-placement in terms of ethnic categories. We concentrate on the distinction between those who identify with a single group and others who do not and analyze its association among native-born whites with such variables as education and generation in the U.S. A key finding is the rising number of individuals who have mixed ethnic ancestry but identity themselves in terms of one group. This occurrence appears to corroborate assertions of a "resurgence of ethnicity" but points as well to a fundamental change in the nature of ethnicity, as ethnic identifiers are increasingly individuals with mixed ethnic ancestry, who are likely to have a muted ethnic identity.

This paper proposes a theory of vertical occupational differentiation based on the role activities of occupational incumbents. Two dimensions of vertical differentiation, authority and complexity, are derived from the division of labor. These concepts are shown to differ from occupational prestige by estimating confirmatory factor models that contain indicators of authority, complexity, and prestige. Results of the analysis are used to suggest resolutions for the anomalies cited.

Sly, Jeff Tayman	American Sociological Review	42	5	1977-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 783-795	American Sociological Association	fla		The organizational model of migration asserts that demographic responses are the result of organizational change and that they are influenced only indirectly by technological and environmental factors. Previous research has validated the usefulness of this model in developing an understanding of the population migration process in relatively less-developed ecological units. The application of this model to more complex ecological units in this paper, however, calls into question its generalizability and leads to the consideration of an alternative model which postulates that migration is a direct response to environmental conditions and that the influences of technology and organization on migration operate indirectly through their effects on the environment. Support for the environmental model using correlation and path techniques leads to the suggestion that alternative sets of factors influence migration differently at more complex levels of development. Whether organizational or environmental factors influence migration most directly appears to be determined by which is more strongly influenced by technology.

Bose	American Sociological Review	49	4	1984-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 474-490	American Sociological Association	fla		Using the Census P.U.S., we focus on household composition and resources which influenced the distribution of paid work to female adult and younger members of households in 1900. Controls for individual and geographic variables are included. Two different household-level processes lowered women's rate of gainful employment, although their usage varied by race and ethnicity. First, home-based alternatives inhibited seeking jobs for which women might have been recorded as gainfully employed. Second, alternatives were structured by household composition. Families with older daughters or related single adults might urge these members to work, engendering a trade-off between the labor of wives and their older children or relatives. The presence of men or nonfamily also plays an important role. Advantages of our model include the study of work and family life as a single set of relations; the integration of the detail of historical studies in single cities with the measurement of national patterns through aggregate Census materials; and a focus on factors reducing the reporting, as well as actual rates, of women's gainful employment.

McRae, Jr.	American Sociological Review	46	4	1981-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 443-452	American Sociological Association	fla		In recent years a great deal of interest has developed in the "sex role hypothesis" as a way of understanding the high rates of psychological distress among women in our society. Although this work has been almost entirely cross-sectional, the underlying hypothesis predicts that the relationship between sex and distress should decline as sex roles become more comparable. Basing our analysis on three national surveys and two community surveys spanning the years 1957 to 1976--a period of rapid changes in the roles of women--we document a reduction in the relationship between sex and one indicator of distress, a screening scale of psychophysiological symptoms. Specification analyses show that the increased labor-force participation of women has been responsible for part of this trend. However, there appear to be no relationships between the decline in psychophysiological symptoms and changes in educational attainment, rates of marriage, marital dissolution, or childbearing.

A multivariate analysis, based on the individual census schedules for the city of Los Angeles in 1850 and 1870, is used to explore the changing relationships between economic, demographic and other structural variables on household structure. The findings suggest that a dynamic, Marxian model can help explain the effects of social change on the family.

Here I present these conditions in the form of a single theoretical decision rule: bias is absent when, and only when, the group mean of the independent variable (X) has no effect on Y, with X controlled. This paper introduces this rule, demonstrates it for the general n-variable case, compares it with prior discussions of cross-level inference, and illustrates it with the 1930 census data used by Robinson (1950). The final section discusses the implications of this rule for the converse type of cross-level inference: the use of individual-level data to estimate aggregate-level relationships.

Christenson	American Sociological Review	49	3	1984-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 398-411	American Sociological Association	fla		Current etiological theories of criminal behavior are unidirectional in structure; positing that crime is caused by a variety of social factors, these theories tend to ignore the reciprocal causal influence of crime on those factors. The present paper assesses the theoretical and empirical consequences associated with unidirectional explanations of criminal involvement. Using a linear panel model approach, it also examines the advantages of reciprocal causal structures by estimating a nonrecursive model of the relationship between crime and one other variable, unemployment. Results indicate that a reciprocal model is far more accurate than a traditional, unidirectional one; unemployment and crime appear to mutually influence one another over the individual's life span. Implications of these findings for etiological theories of criminal behavior are discussed.

Cleary	American Sociological Review	45	3	1980-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 463-478	American Sociological Association	fla		Although a negative relationship between socioeconomic position and psychological distress has consistently been documented in community surveys, we know very little about the determinants of this relationship. The dominant interpretation argues that distress is caused by exposure to stressful life experiences, that lower status people are highly exposed to this sort of experience, and that statistical adjustment for differential exposure can account for the higher rates of distress among lower status people. In this paper, a different interpretation is emphasized. It is shown that differential exposure to stress, while clearly of some importance, accounts for only a minor part of the status/distress relationship, and that a far more central role is played by class differences in responsiveness to stress--that is, by the fact that lower status people are more likely than middle and upper status people to develop symptoms of distress when exposed to problematic life experience. Several plausible interpretations of this differential responsiveness are presented and an analysis strategy developed to evaluate their relative contributions. Results of an empirical evaluation document the importance of social origins and mobility experiences as determinants of differential responsiveness to stress.

Baldwin	American Sociological Review	43	3	1978-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 335-347	American Sociological Association	fla		Modern behaviorism has made significant progress in analyzing private behavior: cognition and emotion. The behavioral distinction between contingency-shaped and rule-governed behavior establishes a starting point for analyzing tacit (subjective, private) knowledge and explicit (objective, public) knowledge. The present paper extends this analysis to include the issues of verstehen and erklären. One subset of tacit knowledge is verstehen. Behavioral analysis (1) describes the special qualities of this type of tacit knowledge and (2) delineates the circumstances under which verstehen will occur and produce valid understanding. Modern behaviorism makes it possible to carry out a scientific analysis of the socialization experiences through which people learn to attach meaning to their thoughts, actions and emotions. Thus, modern behaviorism can generate an erklärte understanding of the topic usually reserved for verstehen. Neither tacit nor explicit knowledge can replace the other, nor can verstehen and erklären. Both are needed and natural components of human behavior. Since both are frequently intermeshed, rarely does one encounter a pure form of either.

The comparisons are rendered as nontechnical as possible, so that those familiar with ordinary regression will readily see how each of these techniques is analogous to regression in cases where one variable is deemed dependent on the others. The paper highlights the availability of linear probability modeling, a technique which has been largely ignored by sociological practitioners despite some attractive features. It also describes eight common errors in published applications of log-linear modeling.

Socio-historical models are generalizations which emphasize the repetitive side of history; developmental theories describe and explain particular historical phenomena. The model of the charismatic community of ideological virtuosi comprises an emotional consociation with a distinct pattern of ideology, membership and want satisfaction. Historically, the charisma of reason and natural rights, which infused its principles into the French Revolution and later into ethical socialism, was destroyed by the advent of evolutionary and deterministic Marxism. The recent youth and student rebellions are viewed as the charismatic eruption of a new moral mood reviving the charisma of reason, and the contemporary peaceful communes and warlike groups are interpreted as the counterculture's charismatic core.

Poston, Jr.	American Sociological Review	40	6	1975-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 773-784	American Sociological Association	fla		An assumption basic to human ecological theory, as developed by Gibbs, Hawley, Martin and others, states that a significant relationship exists between sustenance organization and population growth or decline. The present investigation transforms this assumption into an empirically verifiable hypothesis. Several components of sustenance organization are operationalized and found to account for a substantial proportion of the variation in relative population change in the nonmetropolitan countries of the United States between 1960 and 1970. The efficacy of sustenance activities as an explanation of population change is tested against a number of competing hypotheses focusing on age and racial composition, economic opportunities and proximity to metropolitan areas. Collectively these alternative explanations add little to the amount of variation in population change accounted for by components of sustenance organization. The implications of these findings for ecological theory are discussed in some detail.

Ross	American Sociological Review	48	2	1983-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 228-239	American Sociological Association	fla		Paranoia is an alienation from others that has gone beyond a sense of disconnection to one of persecution. Very little is known about the relationship of paranoia to sociodemographic variables. However, prior theory and research provide a basis for inference. We argue that social positions characterized by powerlessness and by the threat of victimization and exploitation tend to produce paranoia. Powerlessness leads to the belief that important outcomes in one's life are controlled by external forces and other persons, rather than by one's own choice and effort. This belief in external control interacts with the threat of victimization or exploitation to produce mistrust, which may then develop into paranoia. Using data from a community mental health survey of persons living in El Paso, Texas, and Juarez, Mexico, we find that belief in external control is directly associated with low socioeconomic status, Mexican heritage, and being female. Belief in external control interacts with low current socioeconomic status to produce mistrust, which in turn is the major factor directly associated with paranoia.

We hypothesized that work plans would significantly affect actual behavior at mid life, and moreover, would modify the effects of many variables typically associated with women's employment. Our findings indicate plans did influence subsequent behavior, largely reflecting the realization of plans for those who expected to be employed. Further, marital and fertility status considerably influenced the labor force behavior only of those who expected to be at home, while employment history affected the employment only for those expecting to be employed. These results suggest: (1) demographic and economic change over the 1970s differentially affected this cohort's ability to actualize plans for mid life; and (2) the employment behavior of those who planned to be full-time housewives may be a transitory response to changes in their domestic roles.

Because the conclusions of earlier research on juvenile justice decision making are affected by inadequate data-analytic techniques, this study analyzes multivariate relationships among qualitative variables using Goodman's method of log linear analysis to investigate possible sources of bias in the severity of disposition for 6,894 male juveniles. Little support is found for the argument that race or social class bias directly affects the dispositions in these two courts. The implications of this research for understanding the prior pattern of contradictory findings and for the general issue of bias in the juvenile justice system are discussed.

Wasserman	American Sociological Review	49	3	1984-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 427-436	American Sociological Association	fla		The study reexamines Phillips's findings regarding the linkage between the appearance of news stories on prominent suicides and the subsequent monthly rise of national suicides-the Werther effect. Extending Phillips's original data set to 1977, and employing the quasi-experimental method, it is found that stories on prominent suicides are likely to trigger a subsequent rise in national suicides. However, this rise may be related to the linkage of suicide with the business cycle, and the fact that more prominent suicides may occur in years when there is a downturn in the economy. This study analyzes suicide rate data with a multivariate time-series model and controls for seasonal effects, the average duration of unemployment and war. No significant linkage is found between the national suicide rate and stories on prominent suicides on the front page of the New York Times. Employing Boorstin's definition of celebrities, the prominent suicides on the front page of the New York Times between 1947 and 1977 are differentiated as celebrity and noncelebrity suicides. Examining only celebrity suicides, it is found that a significant rise in the national suicide rate occurs in the month after a celebrity commits suicide. Suicidal imitation by the public is more selective than originally hypothesized by Phillips.

Griffin	American Sociological Review	49	3	1984-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 412-426	American Sociological Association	fla		Research on strikes has suffered from the lack of convincing measures of power which are operationally independent of the behaviors and outcomes such power is meant to explain. In particular, many discussions of strike behavior discuss the disruptive potential of strikes for the economy as a whole as an important structural basis of power, but such disruptive potential remains unmeasured. This paper proposes a strategy for measuring such disruptive potential using Leontief input-output matrices of intersectoral flows of commodities. The measure essentially taps the extent to which the cessation of production in one sector remains a purely local event or has ramifications throughout the economic structure. The empirical analysis of the paper then uses this measure to predict two outcomes: intersectoral wage differentials, and intersectoral strike behavior. The core results indicate that the measure of structural power predicts intersectoral wage differences extremely well but does not account for differences in strike propensities. The implications of these findings are then discussed in terms of the general problem of understanding the interconnections between power, strike behavior and wages.

In this paper we examine a central premise of individual modernity theory that psychological modernity mediates the effects of background factors and directly affects individual behaviors thought to contribute to societal modernization. Several analytical tests were made using fifteen behaviors identified in the modernization literature and an index of modern behavior. Based on data collected from a stratified quota sample of 210 Costa Rican adult males, we (1) estimate separate ordinary least-squares regression equations of the behaviors as a function of psychological modernity and background variables (age, rural-urban residence, education, occupation and income); (2) perform a similar analysis after forming indexes of background and behavioral indicators; and (3) estimate a full structural equation model of eight behaviors incorporating measurement error of psychological modernity and allowing the disturbances in the equations to be correlated. The results indicate that psychological modernity has, in most cases, a negligible effect on behavior when measurement is assumed to be perfect, and nonnegligible effects in the direction predicted for three of the eight behaviors when the measurement error in psychological modernity is taken into consideration. After evaluating design limitations and potential objections, we note that psychological modernity is important in determining only a limited number of behaviors and generally adds little to explaining behavioral variations beyond objective background characteristics. We conclude that psychological modernity appears more as an interpretative construct (and that only in several cases) than a pervasive source of modern behavior. Implications for national development and additional lines of research are discussed.

The results show several heretofore undocumented patterns. First, each aspect of SES is significantly associated with distress net of the others. Second, the relative importance varies with the sex and labor force status of the person under consideration. Among men in the labor force, income is the strongest predictor of distress. Among women in the labor force, education is the most important. Among homemakers, education is by far the most important aspect of SES for predicting distress. Several specifications and elaborations of these basic patterns are presented. Together these show that much more than a simple economic reality is involved in the SES-distress relationship. In a closing section, plausible interpretations and directions for future research are discussed.

This debate has neglected, however, the use of the Southern legal system to harass the civil rights movement. This paper identifies two forms of white response-legalistic and violent-to black protest, and examines their impact on major protest campaigns in several Southern communities. In cities where white officials used legal means and avoided violence, civil rights forces were defeated, underscoring the weaknesses of the movement in the face of such legal control. Final remarks discuss implications for the debate addressed by this paper.

On three of our four measures of assimilation, the higher the socioeconomic achievement, the greater the assimilation. These findings are discussed in light of the substantial socioeconomic gains the Japanese American community is presently making and the effect of those gains upon the assimilation of future generations of Japanese Americans. Finally, we develop a sociohistorical model that attempts to explain the unfolding of the assimilation process for our three-generational sample of Japanese Americans.

Harris	American Sociological Review	40	1	1975-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 71-87	American Sociological Association	fla		A fundamental position of contemporary labeling theory is specified and examined: from the viewpoint of an actor publically defined as deviant, increased public intervention will increase the expected value of deviant behavioral choice. Questionnaires administered to 234 black and white inmates in a prison for youthful offenders provide the basis for examining this position in the context of criminal choice, the expected value of criminal choice, and imprisonment. Curvilinear trends in the effects of imprisonment on the relative expected value of "going crooked" as opposed to "going straight" indicate that a modification of the linear expectations generated by the labeling perspective may be in order. An initial decrease in the relative expected value of criminal choice is found for blacks and whites after point-of-entry into prison, and this is identified as a "rehabilitation" effect. With continued imprisonment, however, this effect is reversed and the relative expected value of criminal choice increases. This increase is substantially more marked for whites than blacks, thus suggesting another modification of the labeling perspective: official intervention appears to have differential effects by race.

Pronounced economic differences also provide elites with a strong need to maintain order so that ongoing relationships will not be disturbed. Because a strong police force is the most direct way to maintain order, one logical implication of conflict theory is that law enforcement personnel should be most numerous in metropolitan areas where differences in economic resources are greatest. Cross-sectional analyses of large SMSAs in 1960 did not always support this hypothesis. But when data from 1970 were analyzed the results invariably showed that unequal metropolitan areas were likely to have more police and other law enforcement personnel.

Using national opinion survey data collected between 1972 and 1976, with a sample of about 4,000 adults, we compute intolerance ratios for four activities: homosexuality, extramarital sex, premarital sex, and pornography. Intolerance is shown to be strongly related to the size of the city in which the respondent lived at the time the survey was taken. It is much more strongly related, however, to the size of city lived in when the respondent was age sixteen.

In contrast to most of the previous research in this field three dimensions of power distribution within countries are explicitly taken into account: the organizational power distribution, the distribution of power in the labor market, and the "steering power" of the state. Going beyond previous formulations of a power theory of income inequality, we take explicitly into account the embracing system of the world economy. The specific focus is on the institution of the multinational corporation (MNC) which forms an all-embracing structure linking countries in a differential manner to the world economy. The concepts of MNC-headquarter status and MNC-penetration are introduced. With respect to the latter, we test the hypothesis that the extent of MNC-penetration affects power distribution which in turn results in a more unequal pattern of income distribution. Empirical analysis is based on multiple regression and pathanalysis. Although no empirical evidence is found to support the complementary hypothesis, i.e., that MNC-headquarter status leads to greater income equality, the hypothesis with regard to MNC-penetration does receive empirical support. Significant positive effects of MNC-penetration on income inequality are demonstrated via its relationship to all three dimensions of the power distribution. Directions for further research are suggested.

Bollen	American Sociological Review	45	3	1980-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 370-390	American Sociological Association	fla		The empirical study of the causes and consequences of political democracy has been the subject of considerable research. Yet cumulative development of this research is hampered by the controversial aspects and limitations of the existing indices of political democracy. These issues concern the validity of the indicators, the unknown reliability, and the limited sample and temporal coverage of these indices. After a discussion of these issues, a revised index of political democracy that overcomes some of these limitations is presented. The indicators of the revised index are analyzed by means of confirmatory factor analysis and the reliability of the measure is discussed. The index is generally better than existing measures in reliability, sample size, and temporal coverage; but the remaining limitations of the index are reviewed. The moderate to high correlations of this index with other democracy indices support its external validity. Yet, the differences in empirical results possible by using different indices are demonstrated. Finally, there are two appendices. The first provides the technical details of the confirmatory factor analysis. The second appendix lists the values of the political democracy index.

The paper distinguishes three types of production politics: despotic, hegemonic, and hegemonic despotic. The focus is on national variations of hegemonic regimes. The empirical basis of the analysis is a comparison of two workshops, one in Manchester, England, and the other in Chicago, with similar work organizations and situated in similar market contexts. State support for those not employed and state regulation of factory regimes explain the distinctive production politics not only in Britain and the United States but also in Japan and Sweden. The different national configurations of state intervention are themselves framed by the combined and uneven development of capitalism on a world scale. Finally, consideration is given to the character of the contemporary period, in which there emerges a new form of production politics--hegemonic despotism--founded on the mobility of capital.

Hudis	American Sociological Review	41	2	1976-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 209-234	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper investigates the causal dynamics underlying the negative relationship between occupational income and concentrations of minority (female and black male) workers. In particular, the study examines competition (entrance of minorities depresses occupational income) versus segregation (minority workers are excluded from higher paying occupations) arguments, which have not been adequately addressed in previous empirical research. Regression analyses of 1950 through 1970 U.S. Census data on detailed occupations indicate that competition and segregation are race or sex specific processes. Females appear to compete with white males, but there is no support for wage segregation of women. Conversely, the findings show segregation but not competition in the case of black men. However, neither competition nor segregation is empirically very important during the period covered by the Census data. Instead, "historical" factors which have largely determined the occupational distributions of income and minorities (in the lower paying jobs) are identified as the most important sources of the lesser economic rewards of heavily black or female occupations. Historical analyses are therefore suggested for further investigation of these issues.

The primary reason is economic development, but economic development alone is inadequate for explaining urbanization in the Third World. Theoretical arguments and fragmentary empirical evidence suggest that, in the underdeveloped regions of Asia and Latin America, urbanization is caused by adverse rural conditions as well as by economic development. Data for 27 Asian and Latin American nations in 1960 and 1970 provide evidence that two rural conditions, high agricultural density and plantation agriculture, spur urbanization in underdeveloped regions, independent of the effects of economic development and prior urbanization in these regions.

Drawing on hitherto untapped archival materials, this paper attempts to resolve an ongoing controversy about the sources of this rebellion. It outlines the events in the rebellion, identifies the protagonists in the conflict, and describes the reasons for conflict. The rebellion was led by "association" men, rebelling against a variety of elitist trends in the professional community. The event occurred in the context of a variety of practical stresses resulting from the Depression. My account of this episode is related to a contemporary debate in the sociology of science about the nature of scientific change.

In this paper a fresh case is made for social psychology. New insights in psychology are combined with resource mobilization theory in an attempt to overcome the weaknesses of traditional social-psychological approaches to social movements. Expectancy-value theory is applied to movement participation and mobilization. It is assumed that the willingness to participate in a social movement is a function of the perceived costs and benefits of participation. Collective and selective incentives are discussed. Expectations about the behavior of others are introduced as an important expansion of expectancy-value theory to make this framework applicable to movement participation. The theory is applied to mobilization campaigns of the labor movement, and empirically tested in a longitudinal study of a campaign during the 1979 collective negotiations in the Netherlands. Outcomes support the theory. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

Alwin, Donald Camburn	American Sociological Review	48	2	1983-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 211-227	American Sociological Association	fla		Using data from an eighteen-year panel study of women and their children, this paper addresses a range of questions regarding sex-role attitudes and attitude change. A definite trend toward more egalitarian conceptions of women's roles is observed through the mid 1970s and into the 1980s. There is little evidence of a general nature that indicates that this trend is slowing. An analysis of the determinants of sex-role attitudes shows that youth, labor force experience, and educational attainment contribute to the formation of egalitarian views of women's roles, while church attendance and a fundamentalist Protestant religious identification tend to preserve more traditional outlooks. There is also evidence of reciprocal effects of attitudes with labor force participation, but not with fertility, church attendance, education, and marital stability. Finally, it is shown that mothers' sex-role attitudes and experiences play an important role in shaping the attitudes of their offspring.

Johnson	American Sociological Review	42	2	1977-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 292-304	American Sociological Association	fla		Previous work dealing with the deterrent effects of legal sanctions has lacked an appropriate sociological context. This paper adopts a theoretical perspective which views legal threats as only one mechanism which may produce conformity. Our framework, which is consistent with both the social control and social influence literature, emphasizes the possible importance of extralegal factors in the production of conformity. We illustrate the methodological implications of our approach empirically with a test of the deterrence doctrine that focuses on the use of marijuana. A multiple regression analysis of data obtained from a sample of both marijuana users and nonusers in a jurisdiction with severe penalties for the use of marijuana indicates that the criminal law receives support from certain extralegal inhibitory influences. Moreover, when the relative efficacy of these extralegal influences are compared to the controlling effects of legal threats, the extralegal influences are found to be the more important.

The class vote in Canada is re-examined using a new measure which takes into account voter perceptions of the class positions of the political parties. The results indicate that voter interest in class issues is greater than previously thought. This, in turn, suggests that the main source of the anomaly associated with the Canadian case resides, not with the Canadians themselves, but with the nature of the electoral options presented to them. This finding suggests that one cannot assume that the politics of a democracy faithfully reflect the salient concerns of its citizens. The results also suggest that conventional measures of voting behaviour, which normally fail to take into account the variable nature of electoral options, provide a poor indicator of the nature of mass sentiment.

Looking at the social and demographic changes within a sample of 395 central city and suburban tracts, the analyses model the effects of zoning on growth from 1960 to 1970. Findings show that by regulating the types of housing that may be included within local areas, zoning affects local housing availability and hence the socioeconomic composition of sub-areas in the Chicago SMSA. Such findings suggest that the urban ecology framework requires modification to account for the influence of political processes.

Ference	American Sociological Review	42	4	1977-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 539-551	American Sociological Association	fla		The term "cynical knowledge" is used to describe the understanding by members of an organization that presumably altruistic procedures or actions of that organization actually serve the purposes of maintaining the legitimacy of existing authority or preserving institutional structure. This paper explores the processes by which organization members obtain cynical knowledge. A study of the priests of a larger American archdiocese offers evidence that discrepancies in their belief systems, associated with age, can be explained successfully by an understanding of the role that cynical knowledge plays in an organization dependent upon commitment to altruistic ends. In any institution characterized by a strong belief system, authority relationships may be threatened to the degree that cynical knowledge is acquired by participants early in their careers. Such breakdowns of authority relationships may become more common with the organizational changes now occurring in many professional organizations.

Waldo	American Sociological Review	40	6	1975-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 753-772	American Sociological Association	fla		The "conflict perspective" has generated considerable critical interest in the mechanisms of criminal sanctioning. Among the hypotheses generated by conflict criminology is the proposition that "when sanctions are imposed, the most severe sanctions will be imposed on persons in the lowest social class" (Chambliss and Seidman, 1971:475). This paper affords an empirical test of that proposition, which has been widely accepted as true despite the absence of substantial supporting evidence. Prison sentences received by 10,488 inmates for a total of seventeen specific offenses, within three southeastern states are examined. Product-moment correlations between a defendant's SES and the sentence received provide no support for the conflict proposition, and this conclusion is further strengthened when controls are introduced for "prior record" and demographic characteristics of the defendant. Multiple correlation and beta coefficients are also examined with similar conclusions. Implications for the explanation of criminal sanctioning institutions by conflict mechanisms are suggested.

Liker	American Sociological Review	47	2	1982-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 264-283	American Sociological Association	fla		Work is believed to be important for the mental health of men and women. With limited empirical support, social scientists have argued that employment is important as both an income source and a source of "extraeconomic" benefits as well. The latter include social status, an interpersonal context, and psychologically rewarding activities. Although jobs in the middle and upper status range appear to be obvious sources of extraeconomic benefits, this is less apparent at the lower margins where jobs are less socially desirable. The analyses described here examine the economic and extraeconomic benefits of employment among one portion of the marginal labor force--ex-felons. Drawing on data from TARP, a field experiment involving about 2000 ex-felons released in Texas and Georgia in 1976, a nonrecursive model of the functions of employment was formulated and tested. Using three-stage least squares, employment was found to reduce affective distress among ex-felons by providing both income support and extraeconomic benefits. Furthermore, there were some feedback effects in that affective stress was found to reduce subsequent work activity, further aggravating feelings of displacement and stigmatization among unemployed ex-felons.

Cramer	American Sociological Review	45	2	1980-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 167-190	American Sociological Association	fla		Seemingly contradictory results have been reported recently on the causal relationship between fertility and female employment. Data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics are used to investigate four possible explanations of the contradictions: (1) multicollinearity in nonrecursive models; (2) misspecification of models; (3) discrepancies between attitudes or intentions and behavior; and (4) differences between static and dynamic models. All four explanations are pertinent to the controversy. It is found that the dominant effects are from fertility to employment in the short run and from employment to fertility in the long run. Multicollinearity often is a serious problem in nonrecursive models. Dynamic models are much more informative than static models. Plans generally seem to be consequences more than determinants of behavior. Results (sometimes) depend upon how variables are measured, upon what time intervals are used, and upon aggregate trends and cycles and historical circumstances. Other substantive findings and general methodological issues are discussed briefly.

Occupational status or a similar variable is almost always used as the core criterion defining the individual's position in the system of stratification. This study provides a preliminary operationalization of the Marxian class categories for use in quantitative research. The three most important of these classes--workers, managers and employers--then are analyzed to see what interactions occur between class position and the usual variables used in predicting income (education, occupational status, age and job tenure) and between class and race-sex categories. It was found that there is a substantial interaction between class position and the income returns to education; within class categories, however, there are no differences between race and sex groups in the returns to education.

This paper presents a new analysis of data on inter- and intragenerational mobility of black men from the OCG surveys of 1962 and 1973 that supports Wilson's argument. Three important class effects of the type hypothesized by Wilson are found. First, class effects on intragenerational mobility between 1962 and 1973 were significant for blacks; these class effects were similar to class effects among whites. Second, class differences in intergenerational mobility increased between 1962 and 1973. Finally, upward mobility between 1962 and 1973 was greatest among men from the most advantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. The analysis also reveals an important role for public-sector employment in both occupational upgrading among black men and the emergence of class cleavages within the black population. The public sector provided more high- and middle-status occupations for black men than did the private sector. On the other hand, the public sector was more selective in recruiting blacks from middle class and skilled manual backgrounds than was the private sector.

The results indicate that the fairness of earnings is judged relative to a set of criteria which includes (but perhaps is not limited to) formal educational attainment, occupational attainment, sex, marital status and knowledge of family earnings. That is, both merit and need factors combine to produce judgments of fairness and unfairness. These criteria for just earnings appear to be held consensually and are largely independent of the raters' observable demographic attributes.

Robinson, Jonathan Kelley	American Sociological Review	44	1	1979-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 38-58	American Sociological Association	fla		The class theories of Karl Marx and Ralf Dahrendorf, although subject to much theoretical analysis, largely have been ignored in the dominant lines of quantitative research on status attainment and the political consequences of social stratification. This paper attempts to bridge this gap by drawing out some of the implications of Marx's ownership of the means of production and Dahrendorf's authority for both income inequality and politics, by evaluating these implications empirically and by showing how these conceptions of class can be incorporated into the dominant Blau-Duncan model of status attainment. Using survey data from large national samples in the United States and Great Britain, we show that both Marx's and Dahrendorf's class models have important implications for men's income, increasing by almost half the variance explained by the conventional Blau-Duncan model. The income of American women, in contrast, is little influenced by class and this explains a substantial part of the male-female income gap. As Marx, Dahrendorf, and others predicted, class position has a stronger impact on class identification and politics in Great Britain than in the United States. An analysis of the transfer of class position from one generation to the next in Britain suggests the existence of two overlapping but distinct stratification systems, one a class system rooted in ownership of the means of production and authority, and the other a status system based on education and occupational status.

In this paper we first clarify the notion of paradigm as explicated by Kuhn and by Margaret Masterman, and note that the "exemplar" is the central element in the concept. We then analyze the usage of the concept by sociologists who have attempted to ascertain the paradigmatic status of sociology and we focus in particular on the work of Friedrichs and that of Ritzer. In so doing, we show that they have concentrated almost exclusively on the less important, more general meanings of the paradigm concept and thus lose the major thrust of Kuhn's argument. Possible reasons for this misuse are discussed. Finally, we argue that sociology has relatively few exemplars, lacks a clear-cut puzzle-solving tradition, and tends to operate from discipline-wide perspectives. In this regard, sociology is not a mature science; attempts to treat it as such within Kuhn's framework are misdirected.

Roy	American Sociological Review	48	2	1983-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 248-257	American Sociological Association	fla		An analysis of interindustry interlocking directorates for the period 1886-1905 reveals that centrality was the primary structural feature. Twelve randomly selected industries formed a structure shaped like a core with radiating spokes. The railroad, along with the telegraph and coal industries, formed the core. The other, peripheral industries at first interlocked only with the core, and only after the turn of the century substantially interlocked with each other. Banks were initially secondary to railroads, but increasingly played an integrative role. Two types of interlocks, those based on proprietary relations and those based on resource exchange, are seen to structure the system. The results offer a provisional baseline for studies of long-term change in the structure of the American interlocking directorate network.

It asks why the last decade of research bearing on it has been so inconclusive. The answer, the author suggests, lies (a) in the overlooked flaws in its underlying logic--the escape clause problem, (b) in the overly inclusive nature of its central variables--the omnibus variable problem and (c) in the level of reality it selects for study--the assumption of meaning problem. These three problems appear not only in disengagement theory but in much of the later research bearing on it. In an attempt to avoid these problems, the author sketches an alternative theory. This theory redefines disengagement and proposes new structural determinants of it.

Predictions of the reactive ethnicity and competition theories are tested by using as an indicator of ethnic solidarity the vote for the Flemish movement in Belgium after World War II, measured at the canton level. Hypotheses about the social bases of support for the Flemish movement are incorporated into a dynamic model of political mobilization represented by linear differential equations. The differential equations model is estimated using a pooling of cross-section and time-series data technique which is designed to correct for both the autocorrelation of disturbances and heteroscedasticity. Results with respect to the social bases of support for the Flemish movement reveal positive effects on ethnic solidarity of income and employment in the tertiary sector, no effect of employment in the primary sector, and a negative effect of industrialization. Overall, the empirical analysis lends support to the competition theories of solidarity and disconfirms the reactive ethnicity model. The dynamic nature of the mobilization process is also found to differ systematically across parties.

It is problematic how extensively the temporal norms of business have come to dominate various aspects of social life. The paper focuses on bereavement. It examines the process in which business came to cast the situation of the bereaved worker in a temporal framework: "time off." This gave emphasis to time prescriptions as a basis for organizing death work and extended business time conventions to bereavement practices and funerary rituals. As bereavement practices have been brought increasingly into consistency with the business temporal code, bereavement has taken on the meanings of the business system, reflecting and reinforcing a social order based on businesslike management of time.

Morse	American Sociological Review	42	5	1977-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 716-725	American Sociological Association	fla		This study concerns attributes of organizations likely to facilitate or inhibit the adoption of innovations by organizations. First, it offers an interpretation of the often-found relationship between size and adoption frequency. Second, it investigates relationships between structural attributes--specialization, functional differentiation and centralization--and adoption and it develops a model which specifies interactions between these attributes and the type of innovation adopted. An interaction between size and centralization is also posited, and the model is tested using data gathered from a sample of U.S. hospitals. The findings on the whole are consistent with the hypothesis that adoption of innovations compatible with the interests or perspectives of lower-level decision-makers occurs more frequently in large, specialized, functionally-differentiated and decentralized hospitals. Centralization and the interaction between size and centralization do not appear to affect adoption of innovations which are not compatible with the interests of lower-level decision-makers. Contrary to expectations, the data indicate that functional differentiation facilitates adoption of this type of innovation. A revised model of adoption behavior is suggested, and its implications for a general theory of organizational adoption behavior are explored.

Smith	American Sociological Review	47	4	1982-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 518-532	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper presents a description and explanation of the current character of whites' beliefs about blacks' opportunity: perceptions of equality of opportunity, discrimination, "reverse discrimination," and the over-time trend in black opportunity. Data from a recent national survey show that whites tend to perceive widespread reverse discrimination, to see blacks' opportunity as having greatly improved in recent years, and in general to deny structural limits to blacks' opportunity. We propose that these perceptions are, in part, the product of the prevailing beliefs about stratification held by the American public. Empirical analysis shows that whites' beliefs about blacks' opportunity are significantly influenced by persons' perceptions of their own opportunity, by stratification ideology explaining opportunity in general, and by feelings of relative deprivation.

The access that individual practitioners had to these program networks was seen theoretically as a measure of their integration into a larger social collectivity, a conceptualization that tied the analysis to a Durkheimian view of social structure. The specific hypothesis that was tested was that a strategic network position would be associated with more extensive professional ties to important institutions and decision-making centers in the surrounding community. In four of the six programs the hypothesis was confirmed; network centrality, measured sociometrically, was in fact a better predictor of the participants' community contact and community activism than their personal attributes, the technical resources and skills they brought to their work, or the formal status and autonomy they had achieved in the agency that employed them. In one of the two remaining programs, the hypothesis was not confirmed and, in the other, a reversal was evident: individuals with central network positions were less involved in the community than those who were relatively isolated from the network. The results are offered as evidence of how social network analysis can bridge levels of inquiry and provide new ways of approaching questions derived from traditional sociological theory.

Three theoretical models in the literature on suburban change are shown to be related to statistical measures of change of the mean, change of dispersion and positional change. Because of failure to recognize that there are three mathematically independent dimensions of change, high correlations between measurements of a status characteristic at two points in time were formerly misinterpreted to mean a lack of change. Also, previous studies probably erred in generalizing from only one indicator of suburban SES, educational attainment. In this study, three SES variables, education, occupation and income, are shown to have different patterns of change on the three dimensions.

Burt, Kenneth P. Christman, Harold C. Kilburn, Jr.	American Sociological Review	45	5	1980-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 821-841	American Sociological Association	fla		Moving away from description of directorate ties as a cooptive device, we test a theory explicitly predicting cooptive uses of corporate directorates from the structure of the market in which firms operate. The theory is based on a network model of structural autonomy. It takes as exogenous information the sales and purchase transactions between establishments in sectors of the economy, locates those sectors most constraining pricing discretion within each sector, then predicts where establishments should be connected by interorganizational relations if such relations are intended to coopt market constraints. Using data on interorganizational relations as directorate ties (establishments connected through corporate boards by ownership, direct interlocking, and/or indirect financial interlocking) in the 1967 American economy, we find the theory's predictions to be accurate. Each of the three types of directorate ties tends to occur where there is market constraint and tends not to occur in the absence of constraint. Further, the three types of ties are coordinated as multiplex directorate ties. Where establishments in one sector constrain those in another, there is a strong tendency for all three types of directorate ties to exist between the two sectors. Where there is no such constraint, all three tend to be absent. Support is weaker for intrasector in comparison to intersector cooptation via directorate ties. Whatever the cooptive intent of the directorate ties described, they are patterned as if they were intended to coopt market constraints on corporate pricing discretion.

A clear ranking among the denominational subgroups emerges, ranging from those identifying with Orthodoxy, to those identifying with Conservative Judaism, Reform, and finally those having no denominational preferences. This last group has the lowest levels of religious and ethnic identification. The subgroups closer to the Orthodox pole have higher levels of Jewish identification and observance, and are somewhat lower in socioeconomic status and voluntary association activities. The socioeconomic differences are considerably smaller than they are known to have been historically, but differences in the degree of Americanization, as indicated by the number of generations in the United States, remain strong. The data also show that marital patterns and certain secular attitudes and behavior are associated with denominational identification and synagogue membership. Analogies are suggested between the ideological and behavioral divisions within American Judaism and those found in Protestantism. Our findings point to the durability of a denominationalism which is becoming increasingly independent of its classic social and economic sources.

We find that various structural conditions, such as being geographically mobile from rural areas, being self-employed, or being status discrepant, have no effect on anti-pornography social movement adherence when variables representing different socialization experiences and cultural environments are taken into account (religion, education, residence, age and sex). Historical evidence challenging previous status discontent interpretations of the American temperance movement and German National Socialism is also reviewed. It is concluded that no special theories positing status frustration are required to account for moral-reform social movement adherence.

Analyses of anecdotal data, background information, and data on citations support the findings from the block models.

Each group has a centerperiphery pattern, and the two groups show structural differences that appear to reflect differences in the timing and diffusion of their respective major research findings.

The shift toward egalitarianism was considerably more pronounced for the global items concerned with the general principles of role segregation and division of authority within the home than for more specific aspects of role specialization, such as the sharing of housework or the legitimacy of nonhome activities for mothers. In 1962 sex role attitudes bore no appreciable relation to a wide spectrum of individual characteristics. By 1977 many of these basic characteristics were related to sex role attitudes. Younger women, those with more education, those with better educated husbands, and those who were working in 1962 were more likely than others to adopt egalitarian sex role attitudes, while mothers of large families and fundamentalist Protestants tended to retain traditional attitudes. The experience of the women during the 1962 to 1977 intersurvey period also was associated with a shift in sex role attitudes. Additional education, work for pay, and exposure to divorce were associated with shifts toward egalitarian attitudes while additional births were associated with retaining traditional attitudes.

The theory utilizes information on interest (X) and initial control (C) to make predictions concerning the value of events (V), the resources of persons (R), and the pattern of control at equilibrium (C\ast). The experimental paradigm, which incorporates three distinct five-event, four-person exchange systems, shows that the theory's predictions are highly accurate for V, R and C\ast. Competitive goodness-of-fit tests demonstrate that Coleman's theory surpasses alternative theories based on less input information. The findings substantiate previous tests of Coleman's theory conducted on smaller exchange systems.

Galle	American Sociological Review	44	1	1979-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 59-80	American Sociological Association	fla		Several recent studies have suggested that, contrary to investigators' initial expectations, household crowding typically has little impact on humans. Using a sample collected in Chicago which minimized the collinearity between crowding and socioeconomic variables, we find that both objective crowding (as measured by persons per room) and subjective crowding (as indicated by (1) excessive social demands and (2) a lack of privacy) are strongly related to poor mental health, poor social relationships in the home and poor child care; and are less strongly, but significantly related to poor physical health, and to poor social relationships outside the home. Furthermore, these three crowding variables taken together, on the average, uniquely explain as much (and with many indicators, more) variance in our dependent variables as is uniquely explained by the combined effects of sex, race, education, income, age, and marital status. It is suggested that attention be turned away from the question of whether crowding ever has effects to the study of factors which maximize or minimize its effects.

Ralph, Richard Rubinson	American Sociological Review	45	6	1980-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 943-954	American Sociological Association	fla		Our research analyzes the effects of immigration on the rate of growth of educational expansion in the United States from 1890 to 1970. Previous studies have shown that the presence of nativist, Protestant-millenial groups was associated with the early expansion of public primary enrollments. Immigrant groups provide an important contrast to such groups, and several interpretive histories of United States education stress the relationship between immigration and schooling. Using aggregate, time-series analyses, we find that: (1) immigration decreased the rate of growth of public primary and secondary enrollments between 1890 and 1924; (2) immigration increased the rate of growth of private primary and secondary enrollments during this period; (3) immigration increased the rate of growth of public primary and secondary enrollments between 1925 and 1970; and (4) immigration decreased the rate of growth of private primary and secondary enrollments during the period. These findings show that the effect of immigration on the aggregate rate of growth of schooling has varied as a function of the character of the immigrants themselves.

Weinberg	American Sociological Review	43	5	1978-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 674-692	American Sociological Association	fla		"Family background" frequently has been found to have long-term effects on adult intellectual, occupational, and economic outcomes. Since families differ both genetically and environmentally, it has been difficult to interpret family effects in studies of individuals or biological relatives. This study includes samples of adoptive and biologically-related families with children between 16 and 22 years of age. We regressed child IQ on several family demographic variables, on parental IQ, and on natural parent characteristics (for the adopted children) to estimate the degree of genetic bias in the coefficients on measured family background. The results indicate that there is little effect of those family environmental differences studied on IQ differences among the adolescents in the SES range of working to upper middle class. Parent-child and sibling correlations further indicate that genetic differences among families account for the major part of the long-term effects of "family background" on IQ.

Rational-choice emphases upon electoral manipulation of the economy and Keynesian stabilization; Marxian emphases upon monopolization and fiscal control of labor militancy; organizational-decision theory emphases upon budgeting inertia; and a number of additional thrusts from other literatures are supported by time-series regression analyses of 1961-1978 surpluses/deficits. The final model is statistically well behaved. Analysis of so-called "high-employment" measures of "discretionary" surpluses/deficits supports all interpretations requiring discretionary policy making, but an indication of "automatic" stabilization emerges as well. A focus upon executive policy-making roles is suggested as one means to further theoretical integration of explanations of state macroeconomic policy.

Giles	American Sociological Review	43	6	1978-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 848-864	American Sociological Association	fla		Recent studies have provided conflicting evidence on the relationship between school desegregation and white enrollment stability. Pettigrew and Green (1976), Farley (1975), Rossell (1976) and Fitzgerald and Morgan (1977) have found desegregation to be unrelated to white enrollment stability. In contrast Bosco and Robin (1974), Lord (1975), Coleman et al. (1975), Munford (1976), Clotfelter (1976) and Giles (1977a; 1977b) have reported declines in white student enrollment concurrent with desegregation. The appropriate query therefore should probably not be whether school desegregation leads to white flight, but instead attention ought to focus on the conditions under which white enrollments decrease as a result of desegregation. Among the most frequently cited correlates of white withdrawal is the level of black concentration. There is disagreement, however, about the structure of this relationship. Some studies have found a linear relationship, whereas others have suggested the presence of a tipping point beyond which white withdrawal accelerates and schools become all-black. The present study reexamines the relationship between percent black enrollment and white enrollment change at both the district and the school levels. The analysis focuses on 60 districts and approximately 1,600 schools located in Southern SMSAs. Higher percent black enrollments are found to be associated with the rate of white withdrawal at both the district and the school levels. In both cases this relationship appears to be curvilinear with white withdrawals increasing exponentially with black enrollments over 30%.

We hypothesize that neighborhoods are important social contexts within which individuals draw satisfaction from life. In the individual-level model of life satisfaction, the results agree with past research that age, education, health, and marital status affect satisfaction. The effects of neighborhood context and social-comparison processes show that rural dwellers are more satisfied than city dwellers, while persons living in neighborhoods with a high cost of living are less satisfied. People whose incomes are below the neighborhood average may be less satisfied.

In contrast to the traditional emphasis on the transplanted cultural heritage as the principal antecedent and defining characteristic of ethnic groups, we suggest that the development and persistence of ethnicity is dependent upon structural conditions characterizing American cities and position of groups in American social structure. Attention is focused on the question: under what conditions does ethnic culture emerge? Specifically, what social forces promote the crystallization and development of ethnic solidarity and identification? As an emergent phenomenon, ethnicity continues to develop with the changing positions of groups and individuals within society. As society changes, old forms of ethnic culture may die out but new forms may be generated.

While it is widely assumed that there is an important theoretical message to be found in these linkages, a serious debate has developed concerning the nature of this message. This paper brings data to bear upon the question of the meaning of the well-known relationships of marital status, social class position, and work performance to psychiatric outcome as measured by time spent in hospital. The results suggest that these relationships are secondary associations deriving largely from social selection processes. More specifically, our findings indicate that marital status, social class, and probably work performance, appear to matter for outcome largely because varying statuses on these factors reflect important differences in social competence. Some of the implications of these results with respect to competing explanatory perspectives are discussed.

The net effect of son's educational attainment on son's status changed substantially through the succession of cohorts. It is suggested that the change in the education slope was produced by a change in the educational quality of the labor supply between successive cohorts, as mean educational level has increased while the variance of education has declined.

Data from 2,044 individuals, subsequently reduced to 256 grandparent-parent-youth lineages, are used to explore this issue. Multivariate analysis resulted in the identification of two value dimensions (Humanism/Materialism and Collectivism/Individualism) that characterized the range of choices from which respondents made value judgments. Generational differences in Collectivism/Individualism values were apparent, and on this dimension low to moderate family transmission effects did emerge. But the capacity to explain value choices on the basis of either of these sources of influence was minimal, especially on Humanism/Materialism.

Cook	American Sociological Review	40	3	1975-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 372-388	American Sociological Association	fla		One important reason for the inconsistent findings of the research on inequitably over-rewarded individuals is the failure to understand and control the process by which rewards come to be related to the formation of expectations about rank or position on the dimensions of evaluation which are the basis for the allocation of rewards in social systems. If individuals have well-defined expectations concerning position or rank on the dimension of evaluation which serves as the basis for allocating rewards, when reward-expectations are violated the individual will define the situation as unjust and will attempt to act equitably when allowed to distribute rewards. If, on the other hand, an individual's rank expectations are not clearly defined, rank expectations emerge which tend to be consistent with the actual distribution of rewards. In this case, individuals come to define the initial distribution by some third party as equitable, and when given the opportunity to allocate rewards they maintain the existing reward distribution, continuing to allocate more pay to themselves.

That is, the study was designed to measure the impact of informed consent procedures on response rates and response quality in social survey research. For this purpose, a fully crossed 2 x 3 x 3 factorial design was imposed on a national probability sample of 2,084 potential respondents. The questionnaire consisted of a large number of items in such presumably sensitive areas as drinking, marijuana use, sexual behavior, and mental health, in addition to more conventional questions about leisure activities. Major findings can be summarized as follows: 1. The overall response rate to the survey was 67%; of the three variables investigated, only the request for a signature had a significant effect on the probability of responding. Seventy-one percent of those not asked for a signature were interviewed, compared with 64% and 65% of those asked to sign before and those asked to sign afterwards. 2. Only the assurance of confidentiality had a significant effect on item nonresponse. Despite the sensitive nature of the interview, nonresponse to individual questions was very low. On those questions to which the nonresponse rate totaled more than 3%--all of them questions about behavior rather than attitudes--respondents given an assurance of absolute confidentiality had a lower nonresponse rate than those in two other experimental groups, in some cases by a statistically significant margin. 3. None of the three independent variables had either consistent or large effects on the quality of response. However, there are suggestions in the data that asking for a signature before the interview has a sensitization effect, so that better data are obtained if the respondent is asked to sign a consent form afterwards.

Elder, Jr.	American Sociological Review	48	3	1983-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 343-359	American Sociological Association	fla		Economic stress in families and lives represent interdependent problem areas, although most work to date has ignored this critical relationship. Consistent with Burgess's concept of the family, as a "unity of interacting personalities," a life course perspective on family development attends to the complex interaction of individual personalities and emergent social patterns in family change. With longitudinal data from the Berkeley Guidance panel, this study examines the impact of relative income loss (1929-33) on change in the marital relations and personalities of 111 couples up to the 1940s. Economic loss produced marked declines in marital quality among middle- and working-class families. In large part, this outcome reflected the acute deprivational meaning of income loss to husbands. Marital discord increased under economic pressure as men who lacked adaptive resources became more difficult to live with, more tense, irritable, and explosive. But even apart from such change, marital relations generally grew more tense and conflicted as couples were forced to adapt family needs to unexpected income constraints. These adverse effects are one side of the Depression picture. Another side is evidence of remarkable personal and marital adaptation among couples whose marital bond was strong before hard times and among men of personal stability when they encountered hard times in the Great Depression.

Guest	American Sociological Review	43	2	1978-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 251-264	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper focuses on changes in socioeconomic structure of U.S. suburbs between 1920, 1950, and 1970. Persistence in suburban socioeconomic structure has been important in both time periods, but particularly so in the post-World War II period. Moderate evidence of suburban status evolution is found in the period between World War I and 1950. In the earlier time period, evolution was explained by characteristics of both the metropolitan area and the individual community; in the most recent time period, it related primarily to characteristics of the individual community. In both time periods, evolution in suburban socioeconomic structure has been related most strongly to community population growth.

The significance of this focus is illustrated with cases of social inventions found in the Mondragon system of worker industrial cooperatives in Spain and in new models for agricultural research and development in Central America. The paper concludes with reflections on the implications of a social inventions focus for research methods, for social theory, and for applied sociology.

Milburn	American Sociological Review	45	4	1980-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 627-643	American Sociological Association	fla		Philip Converse and other theorists have argued that the public at large does not have meaningful and stable attitudes. Specifically, they have argued that the public's attitudes, as compared to those of the political "elite," show less stability over time and less consistency between issues and are less likely to be based upon an underlying ideological predisposition. These hypotheses have been supported, generally, by computing correlations between attitude questions and comparing them between public and elite samples. The present paper examines all three hypotheses using a structural equation approach. This allows us to: (a) test for a single common underlying ideological construct; (b) separate ideological stability from issue-specific stability; and (c) use unstandardized structural coefficients to make between-sample comparisons. Using panel data from 1972-1974-1976 national surveys, we find that both the highly educated and the uneducated public show evidence of an underlying ideological predisposition, show remarkable stability in their attitudes, and show equal consistency or constraint between different attitude issues.

Heberlein, Robert Baumgartner	American Sociological Review	43	4	1978-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 447-462	American Sociological Association	fla		Two hundred fourteen manipulations of the independent variables in 98 mailed questionnaire response rate experiments were treated as respondents to a survey, yielding a mean final response rate of 60.6% with slightly over two contacts. The number of contacts and the judged salience to the respondent were found to explain 51% of the variance in final response. Government organization sponsorship, the type of population, the length of the questionnaire, questions concerning other individuals, the use of a special class of mail or telephone on the third contact, and the use of metered or franked mail on the outer envelope affected final response independent of contacts and salience. A causal model of the final response rate, including initial response, explaining 90% of the variance, and a regression equation predicting final response rates are presented to show that high response rates are achievable by manipulating the costs of responding and the perceived importance of both the research and the individual response.

Czajka, Sara Arber	American Sociological Review	41	4	1976-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 573-596	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper uses data from five sample surveys taken between 1964 and 1974 to investigate recent change in U.S. women's sex-role attitudes. It employs several statistical techniques to insure comparability among samples before making inferences about attitude change. The results of the analysis suggest there has been considerable movement toward more egalitarian role definitions in the past decade, with such change occurring equally among higher and lower status women. The analysis also finds evidence that women's attitudes about their rights in the labor market are becoming more strongly related to their attitudes about their roles in the home and shows that educational attainment and employment are among the most important individual-level predictors of attitudes at a given point in time. Little evidence is found for the unique influence of the women's movement on change in women's sex-role attitudes, but the sizable changes in these attitudes since 1964 may help explain the rise of the movement.

If IQ scores do not directly affect people's lives, perhaps much of the furor over the IQ tests is irrelevant. We use a two-equation non-recursive model within a logit formulation to examine the impact of IQ scores on the probability that "blue-slipped" elementary school children are placed in classes for the mentally retarded. We find that, holding constant a large number of variables measuring factors which many would claim are more valid indicators of school performance, IQ remains a critical causal variable in the placement process.

The units of analyses are the 112 metropolitan areas where the central city had a 1960 population of 100,000 or more, and where the central city and the metropolitan area were not coterminous. Primary concern is with determining whether whites were "fleeing" central city problems (such as crime, taxes, strikes, race riots, and large black populations) or were drawn to the suburbs because it is there that new housing and jobs were located. A model of the suburbanization process is explicated and evaluated, using path analysis.

I examine research papers on the issue of drinking and driving, treating the scientific document as a literary, artistic product. Principles of literary criticism, utilized in the analysis of narrative, drama and poetry are applied to the presentation of research to show how statements of fact are given scientific legitimacy and how the literary formulation transfers such statements into rhetorical prescriptions for action. Theorizing and conclusion-making are shown to involve presentational devices of literary selection and language which confer policy implications upon them.

Rosenbaum	American Sociological Review	40	1	1975-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 48-54	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper proposes that a school tracking system can be a good context for studying the effects of stratification on socialization. In addition, the study is designed to overcome limitations of previous research on the effects of tracking on cognitive skills (notably the work of Jencks). In a quantitative analysis of the school records of a socially homogeneous school with a highly stratified track system, the study finds that tracking has marked influence on changes of IQ scores between eighth and tenth grades, even after controlling for initial ability, sex, and social class. Furthermore, it finds that tracking has a pronounced influence on the dispersion of IQ scores. This finding suggests that different socialization processes occur in the upper and lower tracks, a differentiating process in the former and a homogenizing process in the latter. The paper concludes with some speculations on the relationship of stratification to socialization processes.

One kind of social control is known as self-help: the expression of a grievance by unilateral aggression such as personal violence or property destruction. It is commonly believed that self-help was largely displaced by law in the Western world during the Middle Ages, and that it has survived primarily in the traditional--especially stateless--societies studied by anthropologists. In fact, much of the conduct classified as crime in modern societies such as the United States is similar to these traditional modes of social control and may properly be understood as self-help. Several implications follow, including the possibility of predicting and explaining a significant amount of crime with a sociological theory of self-help, itself a branch of the theory of social control.

Lincoln	American Sociological Review	43	2	1978-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 199-220	American Sociological Association	fla		Kerr and Siegel's (1954) theory of social conditions responsible for strike proneness is taken as a framework for understanding variations in strike activity among 78 SMSAs. Their approach suggests that industrial specialization, absentee ownership, and employment concentration are community structure variables which tend to produce an "isolated mass" of workers and consequently a high level of community-based industrial conflict. Moreover, Kerr and Siegel imply that the influence of such conditions on local strike rates is not contingent on the level and form of labor organization in the community. Contrary to this view, the present study indicates that absentee ownership and industrial specialization only produce strikes indirectly by shaping the pattern of urban unionism which, in turn, is related to variations in strike activity. On the other hand, a measure of employment concentration behaves in a fashion which is quite consistent with propositions drawn from Kerr and Siegel, although alternative explanations for the findings regarding this variable are also discussed. Two measures of urban unionism, representing the level of unionization and the degree of concentration in union organization, are used in this analysis. These have notably different effects on dimensions of metropolitan strike activity. Overall unionization increases the frequency of strikes but not their size or duration. Union concentration, on the other hand, produces just the opposite pattern of effects. The study is conceived as an investigation into how organizational properties of urban communities affect their levels of industrial conflict.

These results suggest that increased societal integration fostered by impending Presidential elections decreased mortality (especially suicides) during the two months preceding the elections. November-December results suggest that mortality reduction during September and October of election years is more long-lasting for suicide than for other causes of death. The collective effects on mortality of Presidential elections and other factors that affect societal integration may be substantial.

Classes are also held to be unequal, though not necessarily strictly ordered in a hierarchy of advantage. The theorist of class mobility should distinguish between movement attributable to closeness on a vertical dimension and movement (or lack of it) attributable to specific class relations. This paper looks at all four combinations of vertical vs class-specific, and distributional vs exchange mobility, for men in three countries. While there is evidence of some inter-societal differences in both aspects of class-specific mobility, differences in vertical mobility are minute. The outstanding result of the analysis, however, is that 88% of all differences must be attributed to differences between occupational distributions. The analysis employs a "structured" approach to modeling which reflects the traditional concerns of mobility analysis.

Visher	American Sociological Review	45	4	1980-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 691-701	American Sociological Association	fla		Forty-four studies reporting data on the relationship between sex and indicators of deviance/criminality are reduced to a single data base. Contingency tables (1,118) are generated from the extant empirical literature on sex and deviance and comparable statistics are calculated, using instances where the sex-deviance relationship was reported for specific categories of class position, age, data type, year of study, level of family intactness, race, place of residence, and type of offense. The findings from 1,118 instances are summarized, and patterns are discussed. The overall results indicate that the magnitude of the relationship between sex and deviance is contingent on the year the data were gathered, the type of data used, the percentage classified as deviant in a particular table, whether the indicator of deviance is a single behavior or composite index, race, and the specific offense. Moreover, analysis demonstrates that trends in the sex-deviance relationship over time vary by type of data and by population group.

It is concluded that class is one of the very few correlates of criminality which can be taken, on balance, as persuasively supported by a large body of empirical evidence. Self-report studies, however, fail to provide consistent support for a class-crime relationship. Yet even here more studies show significant class differences than would be expected on the basis of chance. Studies of official records consistently show notable class differences in criminality. While there is a considerable literature which has failed to demonstrate widespread class biases in official records, there is neglected evidence which suggests that self-reports exaggerate the proportion of delinquency committed by the middle class.

Beginning with Chapin's social participation scale, this paper applies recent developments in confirmatory factor analysis in consideration of an appropriate measurement model for this concept. Using data from a sample of voluntary association members, the analysis indicates that Chapin's scale can be extended to include an additional dimension, that the congeneric measurement model is the most appropriate description of the relationships of true score variance to underlying dimensions, and of true score and error variances, and that the existence of correlations among measurement errors in the indicators of participation does not seriously impact conclusions concerning the appropriate measurement model of participation.

The sample consists of panel data from a cohort of 17-year-old men studied in 1957 and again in 1972 (N=442). Analysis is by multiple regression based on correlations corrected for unreliability, a strategy relating measured variables to their latent constructs thereby making explicit issues of differential validity and reliability among indicators and the bearing of each on causal systems. The major finding is that the two forms of alienation are affected by different patterns of structural and personality antecedents originating at various stages in the first half of the life cycle. The model accounts for small to modest proportions of variance in self-estrangement and powerlessness and slightly reduces the covariation between the two forms of alienation.

Anderson	American Sociological Review	48	1	1983-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 60-77	American Sociological Association	fla		The correlates of drinking behavior, and of drinking problems, are examined, using a sample of some 450 employed males in a metropolitan community. Multiple indices bearing on three domains of alienation--work experience, powerlessness, and social isolation--are employed to predict drinking habits and problems. Regression and covariance analyses establish that: (1) the sense of low control (high powerlessness) is consistently associated with heavier drinking and with drinking problems; (2) contrary to predictions that derive from an emphasis on the centrality of work, none of the work experience indices (e.g., job satisfaction, substantive complexity, or the level of intrinsic reward in work) is significantly associated with drinking phenomena; and (3) the hypothesis that social integration might serve as a buffer (ameliorating the negative impact of high powerlessness or of alienated work) is not supported since high social involvement correlates positively with heavier drinking. An analysis of the interaction among the three forms of alienation indicates that though powerlessness has the most consistent main effect, engagement in alienated work and involvement in social networks combine with powerlessness to yield distinctive drinking patterns.

This reform obliterated the existing system of units of time and time-reckoning and dating frameworks by introducing a new annual cycle, new months, a new weekly cycle, a new subdivision of the daily cycle, and a new chronological dating framework. The paper first analyzes the symbolic function of the Revolutionary Calendar, namely, the representation of three main themes of the French Enlightenment: secularism, naturalism and rationalism. It then brings into focus three major factors which account for its failure: totality of the obliteration of the traditional sociotemporal order, overemphasis on secularization, and advocation of nationalistic particularism at the expense of a practical and cognitive disruption of temporal coordination on a global level.

Land	American Sociological Review	46	5	1981-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 505-524	American Sociological Association	fla		This study systematically tests a formal theory of how certain dimensions of social stratification--income, race, and age--relate to risk of predatory criminal victimization. An opportunity theory of criminal victimization is proposed, focusing on the mediating role played by five risk factors: exposure, guardianship, proximity to potential offenders, attractiveness of potential targets, and definitional properties of specific crimes themselves. Propositions are derived pertaining to the bivariate and multivariate-partial (main) effects expected from the theory and tested in analyses based on a representative sample of the U.S. population for the crimes of assault, burglary, and personal larceny. These data indicate that the relationship between the dimensions of social stratification and the offenses studied here is complex, and that, other things being equal, those usually thought to be most vulnerable economically and socially--the poor, the nonwhite, the old--are not the most likely victims of crime. Race has little direct effect on victimization risk, while age is inversely related to each type of crime at both the bivariate and multivariate levels of analyses. The findings are largely consistent with the proposed theory.

Mare, Christopher Winship	American Sociological Review	49	1	1984-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 39-55	American Sociological Association	fla		An important exception to improvements in the relative socioeconomic status of blacks during recent decades is increased levels of joblessness among black youths relative to whites. Few proposed explanations for this trend reconcile worsening employment status for black youths with improvements on other socioeconomic indicators. Three mechanisms that link reduced status differences between the races in other spheres with increased disparity in employment are: (1) increased substitution of schooling and military service for employment by young blacks; (2) reduced work experience and disrupted employment for young blacks at older ages as a result of later average ages leaving school and the armed forces; and (3) "creaming" from the civilian out-of-school population of young blacks with above average employment prospects as a result of higher school enrollment and military enlistment rates. Empirical assessment of these arguments shows that they account for a substantial part of the growing racial employment difference among men aged 16 to 29. Although racial convergence on school enrollment and educational attainment has reduced other socioeconomic inequalities between the races, it has widened the employment difference.

The higher the husband's occupational prestige, the greater the demands to migrate emanating from his occupation and the greater the opportunities for employment in his field elsewhere in the country, the greater the probability of familial migration. The relative "fullness" of the wife's work role, however, as measured by her occupational prestige or her relative contribution to the total family income, and opportunities for employment in her field elsewhere in the country do not affect migration probability. The reverse question of the impact of migration on the wife's occupational participation is briefly examined. Interstate movement appears to facilitate employment for some wives who were unemployed prior to migration, but to hamper continued employment among wives employed before such a move.

Sectoral explanations which stress competition and the size of the employing unit are represented by a weighted index of concentration in manufacturing and by the percentage of workers in small enterprises. Democracy and the corresponding ability of those with low incomes to influence political outcomes is gauged with indicators of political competition and voting. With four additional factors controlled, the most consistent predictor of inequality is the degree of competition. States with more black residents and greater proportions of the work force in small establishments were also likely to have comparatively unequal income distributions. These results widen the impact of the sectoral argument and show that institutional arrangements in the economy have important effects on aggregate inequality in one highly industrial society.

Cook	American Sociological Review	47	5	1982-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 626-640	American Sociological Association	fla		Previous research on high school tracking has neglected students' course enrollments and students' course grades as possible selection criteria for curriculum assignments and as possible mechanisms whereby track membership exercises its influence on school outcomes. The present study extends the Alexander, Cook, and McDill (1978) curriculum process model to include detailed information on students' coursework patterns over the junior high school and senior high school years. We find that traditional academic criteria, including relevant prior coursework and grade performance, are quite influential in determining students' high school track placements. We also find, however, that previous studies have overstated the potency and pervasiveness of curriculum's influence owing to their neglect of such selection criteria. Curriculum's actual influence is restricted to students' orientations toward postsecondary education, and it apparently has little to do with the sorts of "educational treatments" that justify curriculum differentiation in the functionalist perspective. We discuss these results in light of claims for curriculum's efficacy as an organizational intervention and conclude that much of what is observed in high school studies of school achievement processes simply reflects achievement trajectories set in motion years earlier. Attention is directed to experiences in the primary grades as a high priority for future research.

Tolbert II	American Sociological Review	47	4	1982-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 457-477	American Sociological Association	fla		Despite the increasing acknowledgment of the "new structuralism" in social stratification research, important issues and assumptions remain to be examined. The present research employs the industrial segmentation version of the new structuralism to evaluate the neglected hypothesis that industrial sectors constrain career mobility. A conventional mobility analysis is employed to study men's occupational mobility within and between oligopolistic and competitive industrial sectors. Results of the analysis suggest that the influence of industrial sectors is most apparent in late career mobility patterns where sectors appear to be relatively impermeable barriers to mobility. The effect of industrial sectors on earlier intragenerational mobility is also evident in the analysis. During the early career, certain origins appear to facilitate intersectoral mobility while others clearly constrain such mobility. The results suggest that the augmentation of analyses with information on industrial segmentation aids in interpreting observed mobility patterns. Moreover, the findings indicate that there is some substance to the immobility theme implicit in the new structuralist literature.

We first examine basic differences between Durkheim and Weber and then consider Parsons' claim in the light of those differences.

Lincoln, Jon Olson, Mitsuyo Hanada	American Sociological Review	43	6	1978-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 829-847	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper reports the findings of a survey of 54 Japanese business organizations in the southern California region. We conceptualize these organizations as hybrids whose strategies of structuring work and authority relations incorporate both Western and Japanese patterns. Following Yoshino's treatment of Japanese multinationals, we hypothesize that the extent to which an organization of this sort adopts structural features which are characteristically Japanese depends on the extent to which it recruits Japanese nationals and Japanese-Americans as employees. Based on a series of regressions in which the Aston measures of structure are taken as dependent variables and the proportions of employees who are Japanese and Japanese-American are independent variables along with measures of size, automation, function, and status, we attempt to test this hypothesis. We find relatively strong evidence that functional (i.e., occupational) specialization varies inversely with the size of the Japanese cultural presence. With respect to centralization of decision making, formalization of rules and procedures, and vertical differentiation, only weak and inconclusive tendencies appear in our data.

Most of the research, aimed at explaining individuals' radical political orientations, willingness to use protest and perhaps violence, or actual riot or protest participation, has been guided by either a mass society perspective or some variant of the relative deprivation model. After outlining the basic elements of these two theories as well as an alternative differential socialization theory, central causal features of each theory are integrated into a structural equation model designed to explain individual political protest orientation, and the model (allowing for measurement error in the endogenous constructs) is estimated on separate samples of white and black adults. The results indicate strong race-specific differences in the formation of political orientations. Explanations for these differences are examined; the empirical patterns are interpreted as supporting a theory of differential political socialization.

Mare	American Sociological Review	46	1	1981-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 72-87	American Sociological Association	fla		The effects of parental socioeconomic characteristics on highest grade of formal school completed are stable over cohorts born during the first half of the twentieth century. Mathematical analysis and empirical findings based on the 1973 Occupational Changes in a Generation Survey show that linear models of the educational attainment process are stable over cohorts because their coefficients depend upon quantities which vary over time in offsetting directions. The coefficients are weighted sums of the associations between socioeconomic background and school continuation decisions where the weights are functions of the school continuation probabilities. Intercohort increases in school continuation rates by themselves imply declining background effects on educational attainment, but, over cohorts, the associations between background and continuation increase to offset the dampening effect of the changing marginal distribution of schooling. Stable linear model effects are the result.

The "interpersonal environment" mediates between larger system properties and individual realities. Two kinds of interpersonal environments are noted in classical theory: a gemeinschaft environment of high social density, and an overlapping specialized social circle environment. Using stress reactions (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) of Vietnam veterans to combat as an example, it was found that social density predicts lower levels of stress reaction only in smaller cities and rural areas, whereas interaction with a circle of Vietnam veterans is associated with reduced distress in cosmopolitan metropolitan areas and with increased stress reactions in medium sized cities and rural areas. Because combat is exogenous to the men's current urban setting, the findings are less likely to be confounded by "drift" and self-selection. Implications for classical urban theory are developed.

Berger	American Sociological Review	40	2	1975-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 158-173	American Sociological Association	fla		This study questions the common assertion that culture forms go through cycles. Data on the structure of the music industry and the sorts of music produced over 26 years are examined. Periods of market concentration are found to correspond to periods of homogeneity, periods of competition to periods of diversity. A relatively long period of gradually increasing concentration is followed by a short burst of competition and diversity, with changes in market structure preceding changes in music. Assertions that consumers necessarily "get what they want" or "want what they get" are not supported. The degree of vertical integration at three key points (creative factors, merchandising and distribution), as well as diverse mechanisms in the industry's task environment, are found to be important in explaining these associations. Their nature suggests the fruitfulness of comparative studies of the production of symbol systems in the arts, science, and religion.

I show here that the same results can be readily obtained by fitting a log-linear model to the full table, without actually collapsing it. All that is necessary is to exclude certain parameters pertaining to the collapsed variable. This approach is particularly useful for the analysis of recursive systems of categorical variables.

Drass	American Sociological Review	49	2	1984-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 221-234	American Sociological Association	fla		Since the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, various forms of employment discrimination have been prohibited by law. The courts have enforced these laws vigorously, often requiring plaintiffs and defendants to present quantitative analyses of applicant and employee records as evidence. In fact, statistical analyses have become a regular feature of employment discrimination cases. Consequently, there has been an explosion of interest in the production of statistical assessments of discrimination, as more and more social scientists and statisticians have become involved as consultants and expert witnesses on both sides of discrimination cases. This paper discusses current practices in the production of statistical assessments of discrimination and suggests nonstatistical techniques that can be used to aid the interpretation of the results of statistical analyses. Statistical assessments (1) may contradict accumulated social scientific knowledge about decision making, in general, and discrimination, in particular, and (2) may also contradict the spirit of civil rights legislation concerning discrimination. These shortcomings motivate the introduction of a method of analysis that incorporates principles of Boolean algebra, an approach that allows holistic comparison of categories of similarly situated individuals.

Using data from the Youth in Transition Study, the present report develops and tests multivariate models of social control theory which simultaneously consider how the four bond elements operate in relation to delinquency. Factor analysis and communality analysis examine the uniqueness of the four bond elements, and revised and additional measures are suggested. Background factors-measures of social class and ability-are added to the model, and a revised formulation of social control is suggested.

This application points out certain problems in Erikson's formulation that can be resolved by a systematic examination of the distribution of lynchings among the parishes of Louisiana and shows how Erikson's theoretic statement provides an interpretation of relationships between a parish's lynching incidence and its social and political characteristics. The analysis illustrates how econometric techniques may be applied to historical data in the process of sociological theory construction.

Ridgeway	American Sociological Review	47	1	1982-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 76-88	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper presents evidence that members' perceived motivation towards the group is an important determinant of the influence and status they attain in task-oriented groups. Following Meeker and Weitzel-O'Neill (1977) and Ridgeway (1978), it was suggested that people who enter a group with low external status characteristics (e.g., women in mixed sex groups, blacks in interracial groups) can use the communication of group-oriented motivation in combination with reasonably competent task contributions to overcome the fundamental inequality ("interaction disability") they would normally face, and achieve reasonably high levels of influence in the group. Results of an experiment using mixed and same sex groups showed that while group-oriented members are generally more influential than self-oriented ones, as predicted, the size of motivation's effect is dependent upon the member's external status characteristics. Females in male groups (low external status members) achieved fairly high influence and status when they appeared group-oriented, but very low status when self-oriented. As expected males in a female group (high external status members) achieved high influence regardless of their motivation.

Empirical evidence from reading and mathematics groups in a sample of 48 classes shows that structural constraints deter the creation of small, homogeneous ability groups for instructional purposes. Ability groups are found to be fairly large in size and stable over the school year. Ability grouping is seen to increase the variance in the achievement distribution of a class, implying greater inequality in educational attainment in grouped classes.

Specific attention is given to the social skills that emerge as a consequence of a particular style of play. The study, which draws upon a multiple-method design, reveals significant differences in the organization of play between the sexes. The primary difference concerns the complexity of the social setting in which play occurs. Boys' play is more complex than girls' play, as indexed by such attributes as role differentiation, interdependence between players, size of play group, explicitness of goals, number of rules, and team formation. The possible sources and consequences of this sex difference are explored.

James, Michael Soref	American Sociological Review	46	1	1981-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1-18	American Sociological Association	fla		The key assumption of managerial revolution theory--that ownership is separated from control in large corporations--has important consequences for theories of class structure and economic development. If managers do not act in the interest of proprietors, theories based on property ownership are obsolete. Furthermore, the growth patterns of capitalist societies would be altered if large corporations protect managerial interests rather than owner interests. We examined managerial revolution theory by studying the relationship between the dismissal of corporate chiefs and various structural variables (including five measures of manager/owner control) for 286 of the 300 largest industrial firms in 1964. Our results do not support managerial revolution theory. Profit performance most affects the probability that the chief will be fired, and type of control has little effect. Profit performance appears to be an effective constraint on the behavior of both managerially-controlled and owner-controlled firms.

The analysis reveals large racial differences in both the incidence and aftermath of disruption. Blacks were one-and-a-half times as likely as whites to have undergone a disruption by early adolescence; within five years of a disruption, however, only one out of eight black children, compared with four out of seven white children, were in a stepfamily. Frequent contact with the outside parent (an average of at least once a week for the past year) occurred in only 17 percent of the disrupted families irrespective of race. Provision of child support, residential propinquity of the outside parent, and the length of time since separation occurred were the most important factors in accounting for amount of contact between the outside parent and the child.

Feld	American Sociological Review	47	6	1982-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 797-801	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper shows how the social structuring of activity leads people to develop relationships with others who are similar to themselves. Most relationships originate in foci of activity that bring together disproportionately homogeneous sets of people. The more homogeneous these sets of people are, the more relationships tend to be with similar others. A sample survey and a study of friendships in one large factory illustrate the importance of the social structuring of activity for age similarity. It is suggested that the neglect of structural factors has led to the overestimation of the extent to which people "prefer" to associate with similar others.

In general, the data support hypotheses drawn from Blau (1977a) and Blalock (1967) which suggest that the proportional size of a minority subgroup is negatively related to its frequency of contact with, and amount of social support received from, the majority. In addition, female proportional representation is negatively associated with the amount of encouragement for promotion women receive from their male supervisors. Contrary to Kanter's (1977a, b) theory, token women are not found to face more severe organizational pressures than nontokens. However, it is suggested that the dynamics of tokenism described by Kanter tend to partially offset the negative association between female representation and the frequency and quality of male-female interaction patterns. Female representation is found to have significant, but counterbalancing, effects on mutual social support among female workers.
