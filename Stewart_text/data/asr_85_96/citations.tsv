Alwin	American Sociological Review	51	1	1986-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 30-46	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper addresses a number of theoretical and empirical issues derived from distributive justice theory regarding the social psychological process of justice evaluation. Building upon current theory and research, justice evaluation is conceived as a comparison of the rewards one receives with rewards s/he expects. Using data from a 1979 Indianapolis area survey, we examine beliefs about inequality and their role in subjective perceptions of distributive justice. We examine the extent to which  what is  affects perceptions of  what ought to be  using collective beliefs about distribution practices, that is, the extent to which persons perceive departures from justice in terms of existential standards. We find that it is possible to abstract, with a high degree of distinctiveness, a set of aggregate principles representing existential notions about the ways in which individual characteristics are related to household income. We find that this approach to the measurement of reference standards for the evaluation of income receipts has some empirical validity, in that it predicts perceptions of over- vs. under-reward, but such an approach to measuring departures from justice does not produce meaningful variation in measures of satisfaction and acceptance of income.

Shanahan	American Sociological Review	58	3	1993-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 351-366	American Sociological Association	fla		Poor children experience greater psychological distress than do nonpoor children. However, evidence for the relationship between poverty and children's distress is limited by the use of measures of poverty at a single point in time, by a failure to examine race or ethnic differences, and by a lack of concern with explanations for poverty's effects. Using data from the 1986 Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) data set, we explored the relationships among current poverty, length of time spent in poverty, maternal parenting behaviors, and children's mental health. Persistent poverty significantly predicts children's internalizing symptoms above and beyond the effect of current poverty, whereas only current poverty predicts externalizing symptoms. Mother's weak emotional responsiveness and frequent use of physical punishment explain the effect of current poverty on mental health, but not the effect of persistent poverty. The relationships among poverty, parenting behaviors, and children's mental health do not vary by race/ethnicity. These findings support theoretical developments calling for greater emphasis on family processes in studies of children's poverty. They also argue for greater attention to trajectories of socioeconomic status in analyses of the effects of status on mental health.

South, Weiman Xu	American Sociological Review	55	4	1990-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 591-599	American Sociological Association	fla		Drawing on the ecological concept of local industrial dominance, we examine how the industrial distribution of the metropolitan labor force influences workers' earnings. Industrial dominance is defined as the proportional overrepresentation of the local labor force in a given industry or industrial sector. A contextual analysis of census microdata for the largest 125 SMSAs shows that, within industries and sectors, workers in metropolitan areas in which their industry is dominant have significantly higher earnings than workers in areas in which that industry is less dominant. These results hold for two different measures of dominance and four race/sex groups. The effects of local dominance on earnings appear stronger for industries in the core and state sectors, for financial, business and personal service functions, and for public administration. The influence of dominance is partly explained by the tendency of locally dominant industries to be composed of larger establishments.

Barber, Xueguang Zhou, Yasemin Soysal	American Sociological Review	60	4	1995-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 469-499	American Sociological Association	fla		The 1960s represent an important chapter in U.S. business history, partly because they ushered in a new tactic of corporate combination--the predatory takeover. Predatory takeovers not only facilitate the restructuring of corporate enterprises, they also alter the internal structure of the business elite. We explore the factors that led large corporations to be acquired through friendly and predatory means in the 1960s. Consistent with the  embeddedness  perspective, our results indicate that the likelihood of acquisition during this period was influenced by a firm's position in the resource-dependence network of the economy as well as the positions of its managers and directors in the firm's ownership structure and in the social network of the business elite. Specifically, firms run by central managers and directors were less susceptible to predatory takeover--ownership relationships dominated over ties among the business elite. However, consistent with traditional economic accounts, our results suggest that in the 1960s undervaluation of a firm's assets, the ratio of its stock price to earnings, its performance, and its size also influenced the likelihood of acquisition.

Chen	American Sociological Review	51	3	1986-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 403-412	American Sociological Association	fla		A recent article reports that the effects of father's schooling on son's schooling are much larger for men raised in large sibships than for those from small sibships, and that men from small sibships, unlike their counterparts in large sibships, have enjoyed increased educational mobility during the twentieth century. This article shows these results to be artifactual. The effects of father's schooling and sibship size are mainly additive and invariant over cohorts. Apparent interactions between father's schooling and sibship size result from differences in mean educational attainment among sibship size groups rather than from any important differences in the association between father's and son's schooling. The censored regression (Tobit) model, which takes account of ceiling and floor effects on educational attainment, is a useful tool for investigating the effects of socioeconomic background on grades of school completed within the elementary, secondary, and post-secondary parts of the educational career.

Studies in the human ecology tradition cite rural adversity as a major determinant of Third World urban growth. Studies in the political economy mode emphasize economic dependency. This paper (a) argues that no quantitative analysis of Third World urbanization can be complete if it fails to incorporate determinants suggested by one or the other theory and (b) conducts such a  complete  quantitative, cross-national analysis, which examines simultaneously both rural adversity and dependency as predictors of urban change. Findings suggest that both factors are important.

Wilson	American Sociological Review	57	5	1992-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 661-678	American Sociological Association	fla		We investigate the relationship between geographic mobility and the earnings of Hispanic men and white men using the 1980 Public Use Sample. Migration status and labor force participation status are treated as joint selection processes and are incorporated into the earnings models. Despite the distinctive social and residential profiles of Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Cuban men, results show that residence in a concentrated ethnic area deters migration for all groups, even though they experience modest earnings penalties. Residence in a concentrated ethnic area is not related to labor force participation. The earnings returns to migration are negligible, at least over the short term. Because much research on the Hispanic population has documented differences according to national origin, it is noteworthy that our finding shows similar effects of residence in concentrated ethnic areas on migration probabilities and only trivial effects of migration on earnings for all groups. However, consistent with prior research on economic inequality, the effects of residence in an area of ethnic concentration and area wage rates on earnings differed among Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans.

Kelly Raley	American Sociological Review	61	6	1996-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 973-983	American Sociological Association	fla		Using the National Survey of Families and Households, I explore the role of cohabitation in differences between Blacks and Whites in union formation. Previous research has explained at most one-quarter of racial differences in marriage rates. Despite this and a well-documented rise in premarital cohabitation among both races, no previous research has explored racial differences in union formation. I begin by showing that the Black-White difference in the timing of first union (that is, first cohabitation or first marriage) is about one-half the Black-White difference in the timing of first marriage. Then I use proportional hazard models to determine whether racial differences in first union formation rates and first union type can be attributed to the availability of men or to men's employment characteristics. The results provide clear evidence that marriage market characteristics contribute to the lower likelihood that Black women will cohabit or will marry. However, Black-White differences in union type (that is, the greater tendency among Blacks to cohabit rather than to marry) are not related to differences in the availability of employed men.

Staffen	American Sociological Review	60	5	1995-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 635-654	American Sociological Association	fla		Labeling theorists have argued that members of disadvantaged groups are disproportionately likely to be labeled negatively, but we find that in some situations members of disadvantaged groups may, in fact, be less likely than others to be labeled for the same actions. In neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), we argue, the process of sorting and evaluating parents of NICU patients varies with the gender, age, and race of the parents and depends on what those characteristics are taken to mean in the context of the organization. We find that social control in the NICU tends to be reintegrative rather than disintegrative. Because NICUs cannot control their organizational borders and because of the fundamental interdependence between medical careproviders and parents, parents must be reformed rather than excluded. We conclude that when substantial resources must be expended to correct deviant behavior, an organization will be more reluctant to label anyone as deviant, and that when a group is dependent on the participation of deviant members, the group will make considerable effort to rehabilitate them.

Although sociologists have studied how cultural objects are interpreted according to the cultural frameworks of the larger society, little has been written on what makes one interpretation more compelling than another. I analyze the controversy that arose in New York City in the late nineteenth century when an eminent art dealer was arrested by Anthony Comstock, leader of the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, for selling photographic reproductions of nude paintings. I contend that arguments draw on cultural schemas that constitute, and are in turn constituted by, social structures. Simultaneously, powerful interpretations construct an appealing identity for adherents to the arguments. While Comstock had been supported by New York's upper class when he claimed that pornography threatened elite children, the arrest of a leading art dealer for selling the photographs cast doubt on the moral purity of the upper class itself.

Jackman	American Sociological Review	50	4	1985-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 438-457	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper reviews the major theoretical arguments that link political democracy with economic inequality. It then shows that previous empirical analyses of the linkage have produced inconclusive results because they have suffered from specification, measurement, and sample-composition problems. A nonrecursive model is proposed that overcomes many of these limitations. Using 2SLS and a new weighted 2SLS procedure, we find no evidence of direct effects of political democracy on income inequality, or vice versa. However, economic development influences both variables, while world-system position, Protestantism, and British colonial experience affects political democracy. Population age-structure and systematic measurement error induce changes in income inequality. The paper concludes with a discussion both of the flaws in prior arguments linking democracy with inequality, and of the political processes that undermine any such linkage.

Roncek	American Sociological Review	52	3	1987-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 359-369	American Sociological Association	fla		Using smallest space analysis we derive levels, paths, and rates of industrialization from the labor force distributions of 59 nations. Two smallest space dimensions are necessary to represent patterns of labor force change. The first reflects the overall level of industrialization; the second reveals a trade-off between the size of the manufacturing versus service sectors for nations at comparable levels of industrialization. After controlling for level of industrialization, we find that nations that emphasize manufacturing have more rapid rates of industrialization and higher status in the world system than nations that emphasize service industries.

Marxist analysis of class structure has been primarily concerned with the first of these while Weberian class analysis has focused on the second. We attempt to combine a Marxist structural class concept, which views class locations in capitalist societies as structured by exploitation based on property relations, authority relations and expertise, with the Weberian concern with the ways lives of individuals traverse the boundaries of that structure. We examine patterns of friendship ties across class boundaries in four contemporary capitalist societies: the United States, Canada, Sweden, and Norway. Three empirical conclusions stand out: (1) The property-based class boundary is the least permeable of the three exploitation dimensions; (2) the authority-based class boundary is significantly more permeable than the expertise-based boundary; and (3) patterns of inter-class friendships are largely invariant across these four countries.

I present a simple model of individual behavior based on the thesis that interaction leads to shared knowledge and that relative shared knowledge leads to interaction. Using this model I examine the structural and cultural bases of group stability. Groups that are stable in the short run do not necessarily retain their distinctiveness in the long run as new members enter or new ideas are discovered.

Bloom	American Sociological Review	53	1	1988-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 127-138	American Sociological Association	fla		In recent years, the incidence of premarital cohabitation has increased dramatically in many countries of Western Europe and in the United States. Analyzing data from the 1981 Women in Sweden survey using a hazards-model approach, we focus on the relationship between premarital cohabitation and subsequent marital stability. Our results indicate that women who cohabit premaritally have almost 80 percent higher marital dissolution rates than those who do not. Women who cohabit for over three years prior to marriage have over 50 percent higher dissolution rates than women who cohabit for shorter durations. Last, cohabitors and noncohabitors whose marriages have remained intact for eight years appear to have identical dissolution rates after that time. We provide evidence that strongly suggests a weaker commitment to the institution of marriage on the part of those who cohabit premaritally.

David Knottnerus	American Sociological Review	52	1	1987-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 113-121	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper delineates the image of society underlying status attainment research as found in the formulations of Blau and Duncan and the  Wisconsin research program  of Sewell and associates. The image of the social structure and social actor underlying this research tradition is influenced by certain popular themes in post-World War II sociological thought. Society is depicted as fluid, stable, and becoming increasingly middle class due to technological progress, the rise of universalistic standards, and the growing importance of education. In particular, mass society theory helped shape the optimistic image of modern, mass, industrial society upon which status attainment research rests.

Curtis	American Sociological Review	51	2	1986-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 168-183	American Sociological Association	fla		Households organized as families are essential units in theory on inequality because they redistribute the product of larger organizations: the consumption of resources by individuals is influenced by the power structures of their families. Households vary demographically as well as in social structure, and redistribute according to varying principles that typically contrast with those of production organizations. In particular the rules of exchange--economic vs. noneconomic--under which distribution takes place may differ from those under which redistribution takes place. Many issues in inequality theory stem from the fact that economic and noneconomic rules of exchange are both present in the same social settings.

We examine the role of social context in the link between individual attitudes about the environment and recycling behavior by comparing communities that vary in their access to recycling programs. Results show that people with access to a structured recycling program have much higher levels of recycling than do people lacking such access. Furthermore, individual attitudes toward the environment affect recycling behavior only in the community with easy access to a structured recycling program. Individual concern about the environment enhances the effect of the recycling program, but does not overcome the barriers presented by lack of access.

Weil	American Sociological Review	54	5	1989-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 682-706	American Sociological Association	fla		Both new-left and neo-conservative theorists argue that poor state performance can lead to a legitimation crisis, but they neglect distinctions among different forms of political support and objective conditions that citizens evaluate. I propose a theoretical model that distinguishes between (a) confidence in institutions and legitimation of democracy and (b) state performance and the structure of opposition (party systems, governing coalitions). I test the model with data located in an extensive new search of survey archives in six Western countries. The results show that poor state performance leads to a decline of confidence, but not a softening of support for democracy. Problems in the structure of opposition lead to a decline of both confidence and support for democracy. In the conclusion, I speculate whether state performance might affect democratic legitimacy in a less straightforward fashion.

Scott Long	American Sociological Review	52	2	1987-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 184-194	American Sociological Association	fla		Recent theories posit that social differentiation in the risks of criminal victimization is due to variation in routine activities/lifestyles which place some persons or their property in proximity to motivated offenders. For a sample of 107,678 residents in thirteen U.S. cities, measures of the nature and quantity of routine activities outside the home (major daytime activity, frequency of nighttime activity) are introduced to assess the mediational effects of these variables on the demographic correlates of victimization. Routine activities/lifestyle variables have relatively strong direct and mediational effects on individuals' risks of property victimization but not for violent victimization. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for further research on the relationship between demographic variables, routine activities/lifestyles, and criminal victimization.

Ferguson	American Sociological Review	60	2	1995-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 272-298	American Sociological Association	fla		Using data on women from the 1985 Current Population Survey, we analyze the distinct effects of covariates on birth stopping and birth spacing. We develop behavioral models of rational childbearing from which we derive two sets of hypotheses: one for the effects on birth stopping of the sex composition of children born and its interaction with education and cohort, and the other for the effects of maternal age at birth and the length of the preceding birth interval on birth stopping and birth spacing. To test these hypotheses, we analyze second and third births using event-history models that combine a regression on the probability of not having another birth in the lifetime and a regression on spacing to the next birth. We predict and confirm that: (1) women with different-sex children are more likely to stop childbearing than women with same-sex children; (2) this sex composition effect of children born is larger for highly educated women than for those with lower education attainment and for women in younger cohorts than for those in older cohorts; (3) the sex composition of children born has no effect on birth spacing. We also find that the probability of birth stopping increases as maternal age at previous birth increases, while the spacing to the next birth first increases and then decreases as maternal age at previous birth increases.

By relaxing some stringent assumptions of past work, I chart the conditions under which cooperation may emerge when actors can show degrees of cooperation and when actors' moves are misperceived. Results provide evidence that strategies employing a relaxed accounting system have many advantages.

Tolnay	American Sociological Review	60	2	1995-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 299-308	American Sociological Association	fla		In recent years, the diffusion perspective on variation and change in fertility levels has attracted increasing interest. Yet, few researchers have attempted to estimate the effect of diffusion on geographic variations in fertility. I employ a spatial-diffusion model to assess the effect of diffusion in shaping fertility variation across 1,052 counties in the American South in 1940. Variation in fertility levels and the  fertility potential  for each county are measured. Fertility potential is a spatial-effects variable that summarizes each county's geographic proximity to the influence of other high- or low-fertility counties. A two-stage least squares technique described by Land and Deane (1992) is used to assess the effect of fertility potential on observed fertility levels. A significant diffusion effect is inferred. The diffusion effect withstands the introduction of control variables measuring a variety of other characteristics of southern counties, many of which, themselves, have significant effects on actual fertility levels. I conclude that inter-county variation in fertility in the South was shaped by a mix of social forces, especially structural and diffusion processes.

Kluegel	American Sociological Review	53	6	1988-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 895-907	American Sociological Association	fla		Observers have sought to explain growing differences between black and white marriage patterns in terms of compositional effects that have produced shortages of black males, particularly those with characteristics seen as desirable in husbands. Although marriage market imbalances exist, no quantitative assessment of their importance has been made. The present study uses 1969-1971 and 1979-1981 marriage data for North Carolina and Virginia to make such an assessment. We create a composition-independent measure of marriage to decompose differences between black and white marriage rates and their change over time into factors attributable to population composition and to the propensity to marry, i.e., the mutual attraction for marriage. The results show that compositional effects have played only a minor role and suggest new research directions to explain racial differences in marriage propensities.

Peterson	American Sociological Review	61	3	1996-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 528-536	American Sociological Association	fla		Over the last 20 years, researchers have focused considerable attention on the economic consequences of divorce. One book, Weitzman's The Divorce Revolution (1985), reports a 73 percent decline in women's standard of living after divorce and a 42 percent increase in men's standard of living. These percentages, based on data from a 1977-1978 Los Angeles sample, are substantially larger than those from other studies. I replicate The Divorce Revolution's analysis and demonstrate that the estimates reported in the book are inaccurate. This reanalysis, which uses the same sample and measures of economic well-being as The Divorce Revolution, produces estimates of a 27 percent decline in women's standard of living and a 10 percent increase in men's standard of living after divorce. I discuss the implications of these results for debates about divorce law reform.

Smith	American Sociological Review	53	3	1988-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 454-463	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper contributes to the growing body of research that assesses the effects of patterns of urbanization on economic growth in less developed countries (LDCs). Regression analysis of data for 65-80 nations (including analyses of influential cases) suggests that both urban bias and dependency have independent, simultaneous, and negative effects on economic growth. Further analyses reveal a strong positive relationship between dependency and urban bias. These findings show that understanding urbanization and development in the Third World requires the consideration of both  external  (international) and  internal  (intranational) factors, and a combination of the insights gained from dependency/world-system, human-ecology, and modernization theories.

Kposowa	American Sociological Review	55	6	1990-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 861-875	American Sociological Association	fla		Military coups and related problems of political control in Third World countries present a major obstacle to economic and social development. We evaluate a synthetic theory of military coups derived from political development theory, military centrality arguments, several theories of ethnic antagonism, and economic dependency theory. Using data on military interventions in 33 Black African states between 1957 and 1984, we carry out a LISREL analysis of the structural propensity for military coups. We find strong support for modernization and competition theories of ethnic antagonisms, military centrality theory and aspects of dependency theory. Political development theory is not supported. Ethnic diversity and competition, military centrality, debt dependence, and political factionalism are major predictors of coup activity. Military centrality is, in turn, rooted in the same underlying structures. Ethnic dominance is a stabilizing force creating social integration and weakening opposition. Intractable conflicts rooted in ethnic competition and economic dependence appear to create a structural context for military coups and related instabilities.

I use county-level data on North Carolina Farmers' Alliance membership and People's Party votes to test theories on the social-structural bases of the two organizations and gauge the relationship between them. The results indicate a striking disjuncture between Alliance membership and People's Party support and suggest a new interpretation of the defeat of Populism. The results also provide the basis for analysis of the different organizational and mobilizational processes of movements and parties. Additional study of movement-party relationships should improve our understanding of Populism and other insurgent political movements as well.

Ahmadjian	American Sociological Review	61	1	1996-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 67-88	American Sociological Association	fla		Using data on 197 large Japanese firms over a 24-year period, we study how profitability is affected by firm integration in big-six horizontal keiretsu networks. Combining measures of financial and commercial dependence on a keiretsu group with the governance ties of equity ownership, director transfers, and shacho-kai (presidents' council) membership, we replicate previous studies showing that group firms have lower average profitability than independents. Such findings, however, cannot be taken at face value, because the group effect varies with the prior performance of the firm. Weak companies benefit from group affiliation (they recover faster), while strong ones do not (they are subsequently outperformed by independent firms). Thus, there is much less variability in the performance of keiretsu firms as compared with independents. However, this redistribution effect decays in the second half of the 1980's during a period spanning deep structural changes in the Japanese economy. Before then the effect is evident for all five measures of firm ties to big-six keiretsu groups. Yet one such tie, shacho-kai membership, distinctively shapes the intervention process. Shacho-kai standing appears to be a near-sufficient condition for redistribution. For shacho-kai firms, ad hoc business and governance ties (with one exception) add nothing to the odds of intervention. For firms lacking shacho-kai seats, however, ad hoc ties strongly condition those odds. Moreover, redistribution is a pervasive and continuous process that touches all shacho-kai participants. When the intervention target is an independent firm, by contrast, the redistribution process affects the weakest and the strongest group members; average performers are left alone. These and other findings, we argue, run counter to a simple main bank model of keiretsu organization and action, and favor instead a model of the big-six groups as complex network structures.

Predictions of both concerning U.S. labor market entry of foreign minorities and determinants of subsequent mobility are tested on the basis of representative surveys. Most are disconfirmed. The analysis supports the hypothesis of heterogeneous modes of incorporation into the labor market, including substantial numbers of refugees who remain outside of it. Sizable proportions have only managed to find fringe employment in an emerging informal economy in South Florida. Among Cubans, employment in the ethnic enclave is associated with positive returns comparable to those of entry into the  primary  labor market. Haitians lack an enclave option and thus cluster into secondary and informal employment, although most remain without work. Determinants of these various situations are examined on the basis of multivariate logistic regressions. Implications of results for immigration theory and policy are discussed.

Sutton, Robert Wuthnow	American Sociological Review	53	3	1988-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 343-352	American Sociological Association	fla		Schisms are a major source of new religious denominations in America, but have received little attention in the sociological literature. This study is critical of the conventional assumption that schisms arise primarily from internal doctrinal disputes. Drawing on the resource mobilization literature, we offer an alternative argument that vulnerability to schism is related to the organizational characteristics of denominations. We apply dynamic quantitative techniques to longitudinal data on Protestant denominations in the U.S. to test hypotheses about denominational centralization, linkages to the wider environment, and demographic characteristics. Findings suggest that the larger the denomination, the greater the tendency to schism; the size effect is inhibited, however, when denominations are linked to interorganizational federations.

We marshal evidence that the two types of self-esteem may have strikingly different consequences, global self-esteem being more relevant to psychological well-being, and specific self-esteem being more relevant to behavior. We use linear structural equation causal modeling to test this hypothesis for the case of global self-esteem (Rosenberg 1979) and specific (academic) self-esteem. Our findings show that, while global self-esteem is more strongly related to measures of psychological well-being, specific (academic) self-esteem is a much better predictor of school performance. Other findings indicate that the degree to which specific academic self-esteem affects global self-esteem, particularly the positive component of global self-esteem, is a function of how highly academic performance is personally valued.

Telles	American Sociological Review	57	2	1992-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 186-197	American Sociological Association	fla		I examine residential segregation by skin color in 35 of the largest metropolitan areas in Brazil, using census tract data from the 1980 Brazilian census. Residential dissimilarity among whites, mulattoes (browns) and blacks is only moderate by U.S. standards. White-black dissimilarity is the highest, followed by brown-black and then white-brown dissimilarity. Residential segregation within income groups is lowest for the low income groups and increases with increasing income level. For most of the white middle class, residential separation is ensured by the concentration of blacks and mulattoes in low socioeconomic classes and in distinct regions. Multivariate analysis reveals that an urban area's socioeconomic status and housing market are strong predictors of overall residential segregation: segregation is significantly higher in urban areas with high occupational inequality, low mean income, high levels of housing turnover, and high homeownership. Measures of industrialization, immigrant influence and color heterogeneity were not significant. Implications for Brazilian race relations are discussed.

The theory claims daughters became more nurturing than sons because mothers do more nurturing than fathers. Society then functionally allocates child rearing to women because they do it better and enjoy it more. This self-reproducing cycle supposedly explains why women's responsibility for rearing children persisted so long. The analysis in this article represents the social process transmitting nurturing in the theory with a stochastic model. Applying the model over several generations shows that the theoretical process does not preserve sex differences. Instead, it causes the proportion of women and men who nurture children to become steadily more equal. This analysis also considers several likely strategies for modifying Chodorow's theory to overcome the contradictory results revealed by the stochastic model. None succeed.

Sampson	American Sociological Review	53	5	1988-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 766-779	American Sociological Association	fla		This study presents a multilevel empirical test of a systemic theory of community attachment in mass society. The data bases are derived from a recent national sample of 10,905 residents of 238 localities in Great Britain that vary across an urban-rural continuum. The first stage of analysis examines the structural determinants of between-community variations in local friendship ties, collective attachment, and rates of local social participation. Community residential stability has positive effects on all three dimensions of community social integration, independent of urbanization, density, and numerous other controls. The second stage of analysis examines the extent to which community characteristics affect individual-level local social bonds. Residential stability has both individual-level and contextual effects on locality-based friendships and on participation in social and leisure activities. The results support the systemic model and demonstrate the importance of linking the micro- and macro-level dimensions of local community bonds.

Weakliem	American Sociological Review	58	1	1993-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 16-30	American Sociological Association	fla		Sociological research on earnings usually employs models that take account of an individual's position or job. One prominent line of thought and research emphasizes the command and control properties that derive from a job's location in the ownership and domination structure of the workplace. Efforts to conceptualize the relevant job properties and parameterize their effects have yielded a variety of earnings regression specifications. We report statistical tests that compare earnings models based on alternative specifications of an individual's location in the structure of ownership and domination. We focus on a few leading specifications, especially Wright's class typologies. We use a version of the Cox specification test for comparing separate, nonnested models. Wright's class typologies are rejected, as are other specifications used in past research. The results favor a new, easily implemented and intuitively appealing specification of the effects of ownership and authority on earnings.

DiPrete	American Sociological Review	58	1	1993-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 74-96	American Sociological Association	fla		Scholars recognize that labor market structure affects job mobility. However, existing research rarely considers the impact of structural change on mobility. I develop a model for how the size of organizational labor markets and the instability resulting from industry expansion, contraction, and equity reorganization influenced rates of internal mobility, external mobility, and unemployment during the industrial restructuring of the 1980s. Analysis of data from the Current Population Surveys, the Current Employment Statistics program, the Small Business Data Base, and the Mergers and Acquisitions database shows that structural change has predictable effects on job mobility and that labor market structure channels mobility in predictable ways. However, the results also show that the ability of labor market structure to buffer environmental turbulence was limited during the turbulent 1980s, and that the  flexible  character of American labor markets had important consequences for blue-collar and service workers in the American work force.

Rosenfeld	American Sociological Review	52	6	1987-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 785-801	American Sociological Association	fla		Many researchers conceptualize the major transitions in the life course as occurring in an orderly progression. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972 and its follow-ups, we find considerable disorder in nonfamily events. By the time they had been out of high school eight years, over half of the men and women in the 1972 class had sequences of states that deviated from the  normal,  e.g., they returned to school or moved to a category not usually included in life-course research, such as unemployment. To what extent does this disorder matter? We answer this question with respect to the transition to parenthood. A simple measure of disorder did not uniformly affect this transition. Rather, disorder has heterogeneous effects. Particular sequences of activities, some orderly, some not, affect when people first became parents. For example, the delaying effect of education is less powerful if that education has been interrupted by work or some other activity.

Data are presented from a representative sample of 102 males and 99 females, drawn from grades 8, 9, and 10 in public schools in a southern U.S. city, and ranging in age from 13 to 16 years old. Although the sociological models alone look quite satisfactory, the combined models are stronger and give a different picture of the determinants of adolescent sexuality. The combined models show not only additive contributions of sociological and biological variables, but interactions between sociological and hormonal variables. Some sociological relationships are shown to be spurious. In other cases, sociological predictors are shown to be endogenous to biological predictors.

Romo, Michael Schwartz	American Sociological Review	60	6	1995-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 874-907	American Sociological Association	fla		We present a sociological analysis of regional political economies specifically examining industrial migration in New York State. Migration of manufacturing establishments is structurally embedded in regional production cultures that create imperatives to remain in the region, even if the local area has high costs compared to other viable sites. Migration occurs only when the core establishments in a region--the central nodes in the regional exchange network--face outside competition that threatens to permanently undermine their viability. Under such circumstances, only these core establishments can respond to lower costs elsewhere. Peripheral firms are usually too dependent on the material, political, and social resources available in the local production culture to risk departure, even when production costs might be substantially reduced. We test this structural-embeddedness model against the comparative-cost model. The local or distant destinations of New York manufacturing plants that migrated between 1960 and 1985 are examined in a polytomous logistic regression analysis. We find clear support of the structural-embeddedness model. The migration of only a few core establishments--those with the greatest structural autonomy--is consistent with comparative-cost predictions. However, peripheral establishments, comprising the overwhelming majority of all plants in the state, are unlikely to leave the region, even when cost differentials are severe. This finding is consistent with structural-embeddedness predictions.

Alderson	American Sociological Review	60	5	1995-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 674-701	American Sociological Association	fla		We investigate the relationship between income inequality and economic development using an unbalanced cross-national data set that allows observations on inequality and development for several years for the same country. The 88 countries in this data set contribute 279 observations dated from 1952 to 1988. Income inequality is measured in three ways--as income share of the top quintile of income-receiving units and with two estimates of the Gini coefficient (decile-based and quintile-based). The relationship between income inequality and development in this data set exhibits the inverted-U shape characteristic of the Kuznets curve. Regression analyses using pooling techniques with the assumptions of a random effects model show that the curvilinearity is largely accounted for by a model based on three major processes: labor force shifts from agriculture to industry; the demographic transition; and the spread of education. These processes are represented in regression models by four variables. The variables have significant effects on income inequality in directions predicted by the model: sector dualism (positive effect); percent of labor force in agriculture (negative effect); natural rate of population increase (positive effect); and secondary school enrollment (negative effect). The effects of political democracy, Marxist-Leninist regime, horticultural or agrarian subsistence technology prior to industrialization, an indicator for Taiwan, and calendar time are also estimated.

Eckert	American Sociological Review	51	6	1986-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 812-829	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper critically evaluates the theory of patronage and professional social movement organizations (SMOs) advanced by McCarthy and Zald (1973, 1975, 1977) and the social control theory advanced by their critics (McAdam, 1982; Wilson, 1983; Haines 1984a, 1984b) in interpreting the development of black insurgency. Drawing on time-series analysis of the patronage of private foundations, structural facilitators, and the changing goals, organization and forms of black insurgency between 1953-1980, we find support for the social control theory insofar as: 1) the black movement was an indigenous challenge with professional SMOs playing a secondary role; 2) elite patronage was reactive and directed at moderate classical SMOs and professional SMOs; 3) this patronage professionalized the movement, strengthening the staff in classical SMOs and creating new professional SMOs; and 4) these processes did not generate movement growth and may have accelerated movement decay. Yet, contrary to the social control theory, we also found that: 1) movement decay had multiple sources, professionalization being secondary to partial success and strategic problems; and 2) professionalization may have weakened the challenge but did not transform movement goals or tactics.  Channeling  may be a more apt metaphor than  control  for analyzing the effects of patronage and professionalization on social movement development.

Franzoi	American Sociological Review	53	4	1988-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 559-568	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper explores a central question in social psychology: How are particular meanings of particular identities selected in a situation? This question was examined in a field setting, using experiential sampling techniques in which participants carried an electronic timer for two days as they engaged in their normal activities on a college campus. When the timer signalled them, participants responded to a questionnaire concerning who they were with, what they were doing, what identities and roles they were involved in at the time, and what their perceptions were of the situation. From the work of Burke and Reitzes, which postulates that people behave in ways that conform to the meanings of their identities (the principle of semantic congruity), we hypothesized that the particular meaning of respondents' identities in situations would conform to the meaning of the situations in which the identity was held. Analyses of the data indicated strong support for this hypothesis. How people view themselves depends on how they view the situation they are in, and how they behave depends on how they view themselves.

Hutchings	American Sociological Review	61	6	1996-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 951-972	American Sociological Association	fla		Perceptions of threat occupy a central place in race relations in Blumer's theory of prejudice but few direct efforts to study such perceptions exist. Extending Blumer's reasoning, we hypothesize that such perceptions are driven by a group's feelings of racial alienation within the larger social order. The more that members of a particular racial group feel collectively oppressed and unfairly treated by society, the more likely they are to perceive members of other groups as potential threats. We also examine whether such perceptions spring from simple self-interest, orthodox prejudice such as negative feelings and stereotyping, or broad beliefs about social stratification and inequality. We use data from the 1992 Los Angeles County Social Survey, a large multiracial sample of the general population, to analyze the distribution and social and psychological underpinnings of perceived group competition. Our results support the racial alienation hypothesis as well as the hypotheses positing effects for self-interest, prejudice, and stratification beliefs. We argue that Blumer's group-position framework offers the most parsimonious integration and interpretation of the social psychological processes involved in the formation of perceptions of group threat and competition.

In such ethnically heterogeneous cities, ethnic boundaries are porous and are mediated by an intermediate mixed economy. Ethnographic interviews reveal that many immigrants prefer jobs outside the ethnic economy to obtain higher wages and fairer work rules. Multivariate analyses find that, across a succession of jobs and over time, immigrants tend to drift away from the more informal ethnic economy of the metropolis, a move that leads to higher earnings. The use of ethnic ties to locate jobs also declines. The main attraction of participation in the ethnic economy is the opportunity for self-employment. Our model of the immigrant labor market moves beyond the dualist representation of the ethnic enclave economy. We conceive of the metropolitan labor market as shaped by firm size, degree of bureaucratization, and governance structure in which interethnic economic transactions are mediated through a growing mixed economy.

We consider the population size and political orientation of the Catholic laity, and the influences of political institutions, in particular Christian Democratic parties. We use generalized least squares regression analyses to evaluate pooled time series for 18 affluent democracies from 1961 to 1985. Our analyses show that, on average, Catholic population size tends to repress unionization. However, Christian Democratic party strength appears, on average, to augment unionization. Moreover, consistent with Wuthnow (1989) and others, the extent of Catholic political organization appears to generate pro-union political orientations and Catholic influences on the memberships in Catholic unions. As Christian Democratic party strength increases, the effects of Catholic population size on unionization shift from being inhibitive to being supportive.

Cullen	American Sociological Review	57	3	1992-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 275-292	American Sociological Association	fla		Although advocates for the mentally ill assert that mental patients are inappropriately stigmatized as dangerous, research indicates that former mental patients have higher arrest rates than the general public. Because of the limitations of arrest-rate studies, however, alternative hypotheses have suggested that the apparent dangerousness of mental patients is a methodological artifact. We compare mental patients and never-treated community residents on several official and self-reported measures of violent/illegal conduct. Mental patients have higher rates on all measures of violent/illegal behavior, and these differences cannot be accounted for by sociodemographic and community context variables. A scale of psychotic symptoms is the only variable that accounts for differences in levels of violent/illegal behavior between patients and never-treated community residents. Although mental patients have elevated rates of violent/illegal behavior compared to nonpatients, the differences are modest and are confined to those experiencing psychotic symptoms.

We find that time together is substantially reduced by the number of hours couples work (combined) and how they schedule these hours. Sociocultural and life-cycle factors appear to have very limited net effects on time spent together. There is a theoretically predictable relationship between marital quality and time couples spend together: the more time together in certain activities, the more satisfactory the marriage. As the number of dual-earner families increases, more spouses may be less able to sustain each other emotionally.

I revise and update Peterson and Berger's (1975) analysis of the popular music industry and observe that, contrary to their assumption that high market concentration leads to homogeneity and standardization in popular music, innovation and diversity in popular music in high market concentration depends on the system of development and production used by major record companies. Major record companies employ an open system of development and production that incorporates innovation and diversity as an effective strategy in maintaining the viability and control of the market. As examples, I discuss new styles of music appearing in the 1980s, radio and music video exposure, and distribution and retailing. I show that the level of innovation and diversity in large culture industries depends more directly on the specific organization of each industry and the structure of its market than on the degree of market concentration.

Structural equation models are used to estimate reciprocal relations between these variables.

On the other hand, when husbands adopt less traditional attitudes, their perceived marital quality increases. We find no evidence that changes in reported marital quality affect the gender role attitudes of either husbands or wives.

Washington's post-Civil War transformation adds weight to Mead's and Halbwachs's belief that the past is mutable, made and remade for present use. Yet Americans never forgot Washington's original, aristocratic image. Setting limits on later generations' ability to democratize Washington, this enduring image reflects Durkheim's and Shils's ideas on how collective memories outlive changes in society. The very nature of these societal changes, however, determined how much of Washington's original image was revised and retained. Thus separate theories cannot explain change and continuity in collective memory; a single theory must explain both.

Tolnay	American Sociological Review	52	2	1987-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 211-217	American Sociological Association	fla		Age-specific marital fertility rates are derived for the rural South in 1905-10 and 1935-40. Separate estimates are made for blacks and whites and for farm and nonfarm residents. The resulting marital fertility schedules are used to estimate the degree of family limitation practiced by the different population groups. Both black and white marital fertility fell sharply during this thirty-year period, with especially sharp declines for nonfarm residents. There is also evidence that deliberate family limitation became more widespread for both races during this period. By 1935-40, nonfarm residents had adopted essentially modern childbearing patterns. While high fertility persisted longer among farm women, they, too, experienced sharp reductions in marital fertility and a nascent adoption of family limitation.

We hypothesize that the organization/environment relation works in both directions and that organizations have the resources to alter their environments in light of their functional requirements. We explore these issues in light of recent debates over new models of production organization and interfirm production networks. Japanese automotive assembly plants and their suppliers in the United States provide an ideal case to explore such questions because they represent organizations that are being transferred from a supportive to a foreign environment. We find that these Japanese automotive transplants have effectively transferred both intra- and interorganizational characteristics, e.g., team-based work organization and  just-in-time  supplier relations to the United States. Thus, they have actively transformed their environments to suit their needs.

To examine the reasons for this relationship, I hypothesize that both political democracy and educational enrollment are related in a similar way to income inequality. Two data sets are used in this analysis: modified version of Muller's set of 62 nations circa 1965-1975 and Hoover's data set. Multiple regression reveals that measures of political democracy and the educational enrollment levels have an inverted-U relationship with income inequality. National wealth (GNP) had no consistent direct effect on income inequality. A satisfactory specification of national levels of income inequality must include the polynomial functions of political democracy and education.

The analysis strongly suggests: (1) that incorporation begins much earlier and has stronger effects than world-system theory typically recognizes; (2) that incorporated groups, especially non-state societies, play an active role in the process; (3) that incorporation is a variable and sporadic process; and (4) that too close a concern with the imperialism thesis detracts from the analysis of other causes and processes that accompany incorporation into the  modern world-system.

Individuals tend to believe that inequalities are legitimate to the extent that they attribute the cause of their position of advantage or disadvantage to themselves. In this way, feelings of self-worth (i.e., self-evaluations) and explanations of responsibility are tied to the distribution of rewards. Employing survey data (N = 328), we examine these assumptions within the social psychological context of equity and attribution theories. We find that sense of worth is affected both by level of rewards and by explanations of socioeconomic standing, and that explanations and evaluations play a small role in conditioning judgments of socioeconomic fairness.

Such research exemplifies the  content-fit model  of predecessor selection, which assumes that intellectual predecessors are chosen on the basis of a fit between their ideas and the project of the thinker who engages them. This model fails to explain Parsons's exclusion of the American institutionalists, most notably his Amherst teachers Walton Hamilton and Clarence Ayres, whose work fit directly with the argument of The Structure of Social Action. Institutionalist work was also characterized, however, by its negative reputation, particularly at Harvard University in the 1920s and 1930s, where Marshall, Pareto, Durkheim, and Weber were thinkers of growing reputational standing. Examination of Parsons's involvement in the local Harvard network indicates that contemporary reputational judgments decisively affected his choice of intellectual predecessors. This analysis also brings to light the organizational and institutional conditions under which a  reputational model  is required to understand the process of predecessor selection.

We analyze panel data from the National Science Foundation's Survey of Natural and Social Scientists and Engineers (SSE) on 6,162 computer specialists interviewed in 1982, 1984, 1986, and 1989. The results indicate that while the proportion of computer workers who are women has been increasing, the pattern of men's departures from the field does not support hypotheses synthesized from the literature on the processes of resegregation or ghettoization. Specifically, in computer work neither declines in relative earnings for men nor the entrance of women per se prompts the exit of male computer workers. We discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of resegregation and ghettoization.

Sobel	American Sociological Review	50	5	1985-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 699-712	American Sociological Association	fla		Previous designs for the analysis of the mobility effects hypothesis do not incorporate explanatory variables other than origins, destinations, and mobility, and most designs fail to parametrize the effects of origins and destinations in a substantively defensible fashion. Sobel (1981) proposed a class of models for the analysis of mobility effects that parametrizes the effects of origins and destinations in a sociologically meaningful fashion, but his models do not allow for the introduction of explanatory variables other than mobility. This paper shows how to incorporate covariates into the models proposed by Sobel, thereby allowing for a better assessment of the mobility effects hypothesis. Estimation of the new models is discussed, and the relationship between social mobility and fertility as previously considered by Blau and Duncan (1967), is reexamined. Although this reexamination largely confirms the negative results obtained by Blau and Duncan (1967) on mobility effects, the models proposed here also yield previously unobtainable conclusions about the relative import of various origin and destination categories in the acculturation process and the differential impact of various explanatory variables. The relative impact of origins and destinations on fertility depends upon origin status; for example, origins and destinations are equally important among those with farm origins, but origin status is more central than destination status among those with higher white-collar origins. Also, the impact of the explanatory variables on fertility interacts with origin status.

State-centered theorists argue that the USDA of the 1930s was a citadel of institutional strength and illustrated the potential autonomy of the state. In the postwar era, society-centered theorists have used this same agency to demonstrate the role of social interest groups in determining state policy. This article compares the USDA in the New Deal, World War II, and early postwar periods to analyze the process by which the American Farm Bureau Federation, an organization representing elite farmers, gained influence over USDA policy making and implementation. Although state autonomy declined over the period, the state-centered account is supported. Administrative decisions initiated by the state set in motion the decline of bureaucratic strongholds within the USDA. As anticipated by state-centered theory, the legacy of the wartime planning effort played a central role in the enduring ability of the American Farm Bureau Federation to influence the USDA in the postwar period.

The traditional contradiction between order and autonomy can be minimized by responsiveness that considers the community's historical position. When centrifugal forces pull too much toward order, an emphasis must be placed on autonomy. When centrifugal forces pull too much toward autonomy, order must be given greater weight. The relationship between centripetal and centrifugal forces is peculiar. Like a symbiotic relationship, the forces enhance each other. However, at a point where one force gains undue supremacy over the other, they become antagonistic. This relationship, labeled inverting symbiosis, informs communitarian analysis of the current social conditions and therefore must be applied within context. As communities develop particularistic identities, boundaries between members and nonmembers evolve. To reduce the potential for conflict, layered loyalties (allegiances to multiple communities) must be fostered. Ultimately, an overarching  community of communities  must develop to respond to the needs of constituent communities as those communities are responsive to their constituent members.

Preston	American Sociological Review	58	4	1993-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 482-495	American Sociological Association	fla		We describe recent changes in propensities to marry according to the age and educational attainment of potential spouses. Relating actual marriage to the population of men and women at risk enables us to distinguish between changes in the availability of eligible partners and changes in the force of attraction between men and women in particular categories. The procedure is applied to data from 1973, 1980, and 1988 Current Population Surveys. Multivariate analysis suggests that the sharp declines in marriage rates between 1972 and 1979 were not highly differentiated by age or education for either men or women, but that the smaller declines between 1979 and 1987 were highly concentrated among younger women. Age and education homogamy increased during the latter period. Including cohabiting unions in the definition of marriage reduces the magnitude of the declines but does not alter their essential patterns.

Smith	American Sociological Review	57	6	1992-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 843-855	American Sociological Association	fla		People working together on a task attend to one another's ascribed and achieved status attributes and other characteristics that differentiate them. On the basis of these characteristics, people form performance expectations for themselves and each other regarding the task at hand. When the evaluated states of these characteristics are consistent, the broad outlines of this process are straightforward; when these states are inconsistent, the principle by which people resolve the status inconsistency is at issue. We report a laboratory experiment designed to distinguish among four alternative principles. Our results are clearly inconsistent with three of the principles, but are consistent with the organized subsets combining principle originally set forth by Berger, Fisek, Norman, and Zelditch (1977). The conclusiveness of these results suggests reframing some long-standing questions about social information processing. A generalized organized subsets principle extends the scope of status characteristics theory to new kinds of social settings and additional kinds of personal attributes.

This study focuses on how the dynamics of the capitalist world-economy affected the pattern of colonization in the periphery. Colonization is considered a hierarchical alternative to market relations, increased when market relations perform poorly and slowed when the market expands. A time series regression analysis, covering the  longue duree  of the whole system, provides initial comprehensive quantitative support for two central propositions in world-system theory. The findings indicate that long waves of economic expansion and periods of unicentric hegemony negatively affected the rate of colonization. Major wars among core states had no immediate impact but had long-term positive effects. A shift in the international regime brought about by the rise of socialist states also contributed to the decline of formal colonization. The findings point to the utility of long waves, hegemony, and international regimes in long-term historical studies of the trade-off between market and hierarchical relations.

Gartin	American Sociological Review	54	1	1989-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 94-106	American Sociological Association	fla		Using data on police contacts for a cohort of males born in 1949 and followed until age 25, this paper examines the influence of arrest on future criminal activity. Two questions are examined. Does arrest amplify or deter the future criminal activity of those arrested? Does the influence of being arrested on future offending vary by where arrest occurs in the sequence of police contacts: for example, does being arrested have more influence on the future criminal activity of novice or experienced offenders? Drawing on the  criminal career  perspective, we partition future offending into distinct components, such as rate of future offending, duration of a criminally active period, and desistence from future offending. Evidence emerges that is more consistent with a specific deterrence position than a labeling perspective.

Rogan	American Sociological Review	57	5	1992-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 680-690	American Sociological Association	fla		Deterrence theories and labeling theories offer inconsistent predictions about the relative impact of legal and informal controls on the subsequent criminal activities of arrested persons. In a controlled experiment using police contacts for domestic violence offenses in Milwaukee, we test whether the effect of arrest on recidivism is conditional on key individual characteristics indicating a  stake in conformity.  Contrary to deterrence theories, arrest had no overall crime reduction effect in either the official or victim interview measures of repeat domestic violence. Consistent with labeling theories, arrest increased recidivism among those with a low stake in conformity: the unemployed and the unmarried. Neither race nor a record of prior offenses conditioned the effect of arrest on subsequent domestic violence. The results are consistent with findings from similar experiments in Omaha, Dade County (Miami), and Colorado Springs.

Neither differences in individual background characteristics (aptitude and SES) nor variation in structural position (ability group assignment) alone suffice to explain why nonblacks learn more than blacks in a sample of 302 first graders. To account for such differences it is necessary to consider educational technology, the conditions and activities that constitute instruction. The results show that learning is produced through a set of technological conditions, primarily time spent in instruction and the coverage of curricular materials. These features of instruction in our sample differ in schools attended by blacks and in those attended by nonblacks, with black students being exposed to restricted learning opportunities orginating in district and school differences in the availability of technological resources.

Poster	American Sociological Review	61	3	1996-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 466-477	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper examines the dynamics of the transition to democracy in post-communist Hungary. We describe the  founding election  of 1990 by modeling voter turnout and party choice. Our results show that in the 1990 election there was a large social democratic constituency in Hungary, but that it was not effectively mobilized. We argue that both the conservatives and the liberals failed to express the interests of the electorate, and instead played the game of politics of symbols that featured starkly drawn ideological issues. Because of this abyss between parties and the electorate, many Hungarians expressed their opposition to the political system by boycotting the polls. The moral is that the victory of the socialists in the 1994 election is hardly surprising. By campaigning with an aggressively social-democratic platform, they captured the attention of a distinctive social constituency and thus may be setting the stage for relatively stable post-communist rule.

Maynard	American Sociological Review	50	2	1985-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 207-223	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper is an analysis of conflict episodes that were videotaped during reading groups of first-grade children. Prior research on children's disputes and arguments has mapped their structure, but neglected how they function. The concept of function here refers to features of interaction that occur as participants use conversational devices in precise ways. The manifest function of social conflict among children is to build their small-group society and its structure. That is, when disputing and arguing, children produce social organization, create political alignments, and thereby realize their practical interests within a changing set of social relationships. Studying the manifest functions of conflict can be a prelude to tracing latent functions. Disputes and arguments among peers represent a way that children acquire a sense of social structure. Conflict may also aid in the reproduction of authority, friendship, and other social patterns that transcend single episodes of interaction.

Some provide support for the view that dependency distorts development and, in turn, impedes fertility decline. Others either qualify or refute this finding. This study criticizes the methods, measures, and approaches used in previous research. It then conducts a new analysis based on those criticisms. Results suggest that dependency does distort development and impede fertility decline.

Snow	American Sociological Review	61	6	1996-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1089-1109	American Sociological Association	fla		For over two decades, resources have been assumed to be a fundamental determinant of the course and character of social movement organizations (SMOs) and their activities. Yet surprisingly little research evaluates this taken-for-granted assumption. Using data from ethnographic fieldwork on 15 homeless SMOs in eight U.S. cities, we construct an empirically grounded typology of resources and assess the combinations of resources necessary for the viability of homeless SMOs. We then examine the sources of support for these organizations, highlighting the influence of benefactor organizations on SMO viability and tactics. Employing qualitative comparative analysis, we identify three resource configurations among the viable SMOs and find that certain resource types contributed more than others to viability. Support from benefactors also ensured viability of these organizations without moderating their tactics. We explain the implications of these findings for understanding the roles that resources and sponsorship or patronage play in the careers of SMOs and the relevance of resources, sponsorship, and organization to social movements of the poor.

Liaisons, with less integrated friendship networks, are crucial to the permeability of social systems. Using data on 2,299 children, grades three through twelve, in a community school system, we show that the proportion of group members increases through grade six, then declines, while the proportion of liaisons increases continuously. This finding challenges traditional accounts of the development of cliques and suggests that the study of the degrouping process may provide an important link between adolescent and adult social networks.

Four steps toward participation in social movements are then distinguished: becoming part of the mobilization potential, becoming target of mobilization attempts, becoming motivated to participate, and overcoming barriers to participation. The relevance of these distinctions is justified theoretically by the claim that different theories are needed to explain separate aspects of mobilization and participation, and practically with the argument that different efforts are required from movement organizations depending on which aspect they are handling. Empirical support from research on mobilization and participation in the Dutch peace movement is presented. Nonparticipation in a mass demonstration can be based on four grounds: lack of sympathy for the movement, not being the target of a mobilization attempt, not being motivated, and the presence of barriers. These results are interpreted in terms of the literature on mobilization and participation.

The logic of the major theories of labor-force behavior implies that a large minority labor-force presence will be negatively correlated with an industry's level of productivity because of the relatively weak attachment to the work force of such groups as blacks and women. After exploring information about the manufacturing industries in the United States in the early 1960s and early 1970s, we find no evidence to support this implication. If anything, an industrial category's level of productivity is positively related to the percent black in that industry's labor force, once other relevant characteristics are controlled. These preliminary findings deserve further theoretical and empirical specification.

We take advantage of recent advances in class analysis and statistical methodology to introduce a distinction between  traditional  class voting and  total  class voting. Neither shows a decline in the postwar era. The realignment occurred since 1968, as professionals and nonmanagerial white-collar workers moved from voting for Republicans to supporting Democratic presidential candidates. Stronger support for Republicans among the self-employed and among managers has more than offset the shift of professionals and nonmanagerial white-collar workers to the Democrats. Skilled blue-collar workers have become volatile, moving away from their historic support for the Democratic Party without firmly attaching themselves to the Republican Party.

Waite	American Sociological Review	52	4	1987-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 541-547	American Sociological Association	fla		Using data from a recent longitudinal study of a single high school graduating class, we examine the relationship between parenthood and sex role attitudes and aspirations. We find that parents are more traditional than nonparents, partly because parents were more traditional prior to having a child. Controlling on earlier traditional-egalitarian orientations, the transition to parenthood exerts effects that vary by the color and marital status of the respondent. For white married respondents, becoming a parent has a clear and traditionalizing influence. For unwed black women, the opposite effect is observed--parenthood leads to more egalitarian attitudes. We interpret this pattern to reflect costs and benefits of traditional sex roles to different groups under different situations.

Baron	American Sociological Review	52	5	1987-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 574-587	American Sociological Association	fla		How does gender segregation at work affects men's well-being, as expressed in their psychological orientations toward work? Analyzing a sample of employed males in the 1973 Quality of Employment Survey, we find that men in mixed work settings report significantly lower job-related satisfaction and self-esteem and more job-related depression than men in either male- or female-dominated work settings, even after controlling for individual, job, organizational, and economic determinants of well-being. These findings are difficult to reconcile with theories suggesting that men dislike gender integration at work simply for economic reasons or with the view that male tokens suffer psychologically by occupying low-status positions viewed as  female  jobs. Rather, our findings are more consistent with perspectives that emphasize how the quality and quantity of intergroup relations decline as groups become more balanced. The implications of our results for segregation theories and for efforts to remedy segregation are discussed.

Wiseley	American Sociological Review	59	1	1994-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 98-121	American Sociological Association	fla		We investigate how the balance of power in exchange relations affects actors' perceptions of the fairness of their partners' power strategies. If justice is in the eye of the beholder, as virtually all social psychological theories of justice assume, does its subjective nature work to the advantage of the powerful or the weak? Alternative perspectives on justice and power suggest competing hypotheses. One view proposes that norms of justice support and legitimate behavioral inequalities that favor the powerful; the second view argues that norms of justice counter and oppose the effects of power. Using an experimental design that allows us to manipulate structural power and behavioral strategies independently, we test hypotheses derived from these competing theories in relations of direct, nonnegotiated exchange. We find no evidence for an opposing effect of justice and substantial support for a legitimating effect. Most significantly, punishment strategies are perceived as more fair when used by exchange partners who are advantaged on reward power than when used by disadvantaged partners.

Social trends associated with industrialization may affect groups in such a way that ethnicity becomes a more convenient basis for mobilization than others, e.g., class. In such cases, ethnic solidarity is a natural outcome of development. Historical scenarios associated with this possibility are discussed.

I develop a conceptual view of the social institutions that comprise markets, discuss a sociological model of action in which market participants try to create stable worlds and find social solutions to competition, and discuss how markets and states are intimately linked. From these foundations, I generate propositions about how politics in markets work during various stages of market development--formation, stability, and transformation. At the formation of markets, when actors in firms are trying to create a status hierarchy that enforces noncompetitive forms of competition, political action resembles social movements. In stable markets, incumbent firms defend their positions against challengers and invaders. During periods of market transformation, invaders can reintroduce more fluid social-movement-like conditions.

Reed	American Sociological Review	50	4	1985-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 547-560	American Sociological Association	fla		Social control theory hypothesizes that ties to conventional institutions control or inhibit most people most of the time from acting on deviant motives. Our research examines the relationship between juvenile delinquency and ties to conventional institutions, defined by recent researchers as attachment to parents and school. Assuming a recursive causal structure, extant research regresses delinquency on social attachment. The findings, showing a negative effect of attachment on delinquency, have been used to support social control theory. We question the recursiveness assumption. It seems reasonable to assume that delinquency is as likely to affect attachment as attachment is to affect it. Our research estimates a nonrecursive model using OLS crosslag and simultaneous equation methods. The findings suggest that the effects are reciprocal and contingent on social status and, thus, raise serious questions about the validity of extant research as a test of social control theory.

Besser	American Sociological Review	58	6	1993-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 873-881	American Sociological Association	fla		I review research comparing the commitment to work of American and Japanese workers. Because Japanese workers demonstrate high levels of commited behaviors (e.g., low absenteeism and turnover), this research concludes that Japanese workers are more committed than are American workers. However, this research dismisses the finding that American workers express a commitment to work that is greater than (or at least similar to) Japanese workers. I argue that this incongruity between expressed commitment and committed behaviors has several explanations: Greater duality exists in the Japanese labor market. Differences in cultural contexts make behavioral indicators dubious measures of commitment. Japanese organizations may elicit committed behaviors from their workers without producing personal feelings of commitment. The relationship between attitudes and behavior may be less direct than is often assumed. Continuing to distrust the validity of survey results regarding the commitment of Japanese workers avoids confronting these alternative explanations.

Analysis of the 1983 Israeli Census reveals that the rules by which minority members achieve socioeconomic status vary considerably across bi-ethnic and mono-ethnic labor markets. Arabs working in Jewish communities (bi-ethnic labor markets) suffer the detrimental consequences of both occupational and income discrimination more than any other group. By contrast, Arabs working in Arab communities (mono-ethnic labor markets) are occupationally advantaged. With the absence of competition, they produce incumbents for positions usually held by Jews. The findings suggest that the magnitude of disadvantages that superordinate groups force on minority groups is highly dependent on the degree of group competition in the local labor market.

Modeling furnishes the foundation for explanation while classifying provides the tool through which explanation can be generalized. These two strategies are often confused in the analysis of social structures and this confusion leads to serious epistemological flaws with far-reaching implications for the entire discipline. Structural as opposed to classificatory relationships as they relate to concepts, units of analysis, levels of scale, and causation are also discussed.

These effects are interpreted as a form of socialization--not as psychodynamic or class effects--and they are investigated in a comparative-historical perspective, using attitudes on anti-Semitism as the dependent variable. Selznick and Steinberg's hypothesis that education's liberalizing effects represent the influence of the  official,  Enlightenment culture in the United States is expanded and applied cross-nationally in the United States, West Germany, Austria, and France. It is argued that this effect varies according to two determinants of Enlightenment culture: the length of time a country has had a liberal-democratic regime form, and the degree of religious heterogeneity in the country.

Lawler	American Sociological Review	57	3	1992-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 327-339	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper offers a theory linking choice processes with the experience of transitory emotion and the development of enduring affective attachments to nested collectivities, i.e., subgroups within a larger group, organization, or society. According to the theory, persons become emotionally attached to groups that strengthen their generalized sense of control. The underlying propositions are that: (1) choice processes that foster a high sense of control produce positive emotion (happiness, pride, gratitude); (2) such positive emotion strengthens affective attachments to groups perceived as most responsible for the choice opportunity; and (3) such positive emotion strengthens attachments to proximal subgroups more than to larger, more encompassing collectivities. Complementary predictions obtain for lack of choice, negative emotion (sadness, shame, hostility), and the weakening of collective attachments. The theory explicates a subtle social process important to individual/group relations, and suggests conditions likely to produce behavior directed at the collective welfare.

In this essay we attempt to explain why these received truths are, in fact, nostalgic myths. We try to demonstrate that religious participation is and ought to be higher in cities and that competition among religious bodies increases levels of religious mobilization. Our analysis is based on the 1906 U.S. Census of Religious Bodies, and the units of analysis are the 150 largest cities--all of those having an estimated population of 25,000 or more.

Lawler, Jeongkoo Yoon	American Sociological Review	61	1	1996-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 89-108	American Sociological Association	fla		We develop and test a theory of relational cohesion, which predicts how and when people in exchange become committed to their relationship. The theory focuses on dyads within networks and predicts that more equal power and greater  total,  or mutual, power promote exchanges that arouse positive emotions and create perceptions of the relation as a cohesive unit. The behavioral consequences are a tendency for actors to (1) stay in the exchange relation despite attractive alternatives, (2) provide each other token gifts, and (3) contribute to a new joint venture. Three laboratory experiments test and support the theory. Our results suggest that complementary emotional/affective and uncertainty-reduction processes explain the effect of repetitive exchanges on commitment formation. The broad implication is that frequent exchanges by the same actors in a network result in their relation becoming a valued object in itself and a source of informal constraint on malfeasance.

Using the Weimar Republic as an example, volatile partisan attachments among groups of supporters of the more ideologically  moderate  political parties are examined. A formal model comprised of a system of four interdependent differential equations is used to characterize the aggregate voter shifts over time of various groups in the population. The results show that a large wave of new voters disrupted emerging electoral patterns in 1930. In the subsequent realigning election of July 1932, electoral support for non-Catholic  moderate  parties was transferred to the extreme rightist parties, notably the Nazis.

Owens	American Sociological Review	59	3	1994-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 391-407	American Sociological Association	fla		The presumed relationship between adolescent's self-esteem and the occurrence of social problems is a recurring theme in academic and public discourse. Evidence for this relationship is limited by an overreliance on global measures of self-esteem that combine positive and negative self-evaluations in a single measure. My study uses this prior research on the relationship of global measures of self-esteem to adolescent social problems as a comparative reference point for an analysis of the link between negative and positive self-worth and youth problems. Using nonrecursive linear structural equation models and data from the Youth in Transition study, I compare the reciprocal interrelations of self-deprecation (negative self-evaluations), positive self-worth (positive self-evaluations), and global self-esteem (which includes both positive and negative evaluations) on high school grades, depression, and delinquency. I find that when self-deprecation and positive self-worth measures are employed, nuances are revealed that were previously overlooked in studies relying exclusively on global self-esteem. For example, I find a powerful reciprocal causal relationship between self-deprecation and depression and an effect of self-deprecation and positive self-worth on grades in school. These findings encourage theoretical developments of a bidimensional construct to measure self-esteem that includes, in particular, self-deprecation.

Data on the Knights of Labor are used to examine how craft organization in the iron and steel industry affected the incorporation of industrial workers into the labor movement. We find that even in the absence of ideological opposition to class-based organization, building on craft associations tended to create a divided and limited labor movement. This study suggests that pre-existing organization can simultaneously help emerging interest groups organize and reinforce the traditional divisions that segment these emerging interest groups.

Ridgeway, Joseph Berger	American Sociological Review	51	5	1986-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 603-617	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper proposes an expectation states theory of the legitimation of power and prestige orders in task groups. Valued status positions are a reward for those whose distribution members develop expectations. The more differentiated these expectations, the more likely that the power and prestige order will be treated as legitimate. Applying our formulation to various types of group structures we derive a set of theoretical assertions that relate the initial status composition of a group to the likelihood that its power and prestige order becomes legitimatized. These predict, among other things, that legitimation of structure is more likely to develop in heterogeneous status consistent groups than in groups that are initially homogeneous, and it is more likely to develop in the latter groups than in heterogeneous status inconsistent groups. If verified, these predictions will provide an explanation for the difficulty that those who operate from a disadvantaged external status position, such as women and minorities in mixed sex or bi-racial groups, often face in trying to wield directive power over their members even when they are task leaders.

I make little more than an opening statement in defense. Those who agree with it as well as those who reject it are urged to compare the power of their favorite paradigms with those they do not like in handling a common core of sociological problems. Such comparative analyses will help accomplish two things: a clarification of the major differences between paradigms and the identification of lacunae, the removal of which makes each paradigm more powerful in addressing the core of the discipline. The plurality of paradigms may thus actually be a resource that can be used to strengthen competing paradigms, making sociology progressively mature.

Utilizing data on the Israeli labor force for the years 1969 and 1982 we examine changes in the occupational distribution of four distinct groups: Jews of European/American origin, Jews of Asian/African origin, Israeli Arabs, and non-citizen Arabs from the West Bank and the Gaza District. Longlinear analysis is employed to distinguish between structural and compositional sources of group mobility. Our findings indicate that changes in the ethnicity-occupation relationship that took place over time were more strongly related to structural shifts than to compositional changes in the labor force. Analysis at the occupational level revealed considerable variation in ethnic mobility within and outside of occupations. Specifically, superordinate groups benefitted more from the structural and compositional changes than did other groups. While occupational differentiation between Asian/African Jews and European/American Jews did not change, differentiation between Jews and Arabs increased. These findings are discussed in light of sociological theories of mobility and ethnic organization of the labor market.

Muller	American Sociological Review	60	6	1995-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 966-982	American Sociological Association	fla		The relationship between the level of economic development and the level of democracy found in most quantitative cross-national research implies that the largest gains in democracy are experienced by countries at intermediate levels of development. During the 1960s and 1970s, however, middle-income countries were more likely to register declines in democracy than increases. I explain this anomaly with the hypothesis that income inequality affects democracy, and this effect often counteracts the positive influence of economic development. Because intermediate levels of economic development are associated with the highest levels of income inequality, the independent negative effect of income inequality on change in level of democracy explains the declines in democracy in middle-income countries. Cross-national data from a sample of 58 countries support the hypothesis of a negative effect of income inequality on change in level of democracy from 1965 to 1980. This effect is robust when noneconomic determinants of democracy are taken into account and when sample size is increased.

I discuss five kinds of framework decisions: the sociopolitical boundaries of the collectivity under investigation, the historical periodization of the society, the terminology used to characterize sociological processes and phenomena, the way the research problem is posed, and the subjects deemed appropriate for investigation. In a case study of Israel, I show that the Palestinian minority and Jewish-Arab conflict were characterized by mainstream Israeli sociologists in accordance with dominant Zionist perspectives. Cultural commitments, perceived existential needs, and class, ethnic, and national interests, have shaped the way Israeli sociologists portray the basic features of Israeli society.

Several changes in current practices are vital, including the cessation of nonproductive assaults between sociologists on the evidence used in the discipline. More fundamentally, theory should not be viewed as one pole of a continuum with research on the other end. A probabilistic view of theory is proposed such that a theory may be correct even if there is negative evidence. This leads to a different way of evaluating evidence, a different view of the role of examples, a distinction between explanations of particular events as opposed to evaluations of theories, skepticism about the possibility of developing theories that account for long complex chains of events, and a sharp differentiation between the evidence used in applied as opposed to basic research. A new sociological specialty should concern itself with epistemological issues that arise in determining the verifiable propositions that are the basic building blocks to sociological knowledge.

Data on the 1980 New Mexico prison riot provide support for certain aspects of this model. From 1970 to 1975, the State Penitentiary provided inmates with employment opportunities and recreational programs. These integrating activities were sharply curtailed after 1975. As a consequence, inmates experienced strong feelings of deprivation, and inter-inmate violence increased. The 1980 riot reflected the disintegration of the previous five years. No one element was in control of the riot, and the level of brutality surpassed that of any other U.S. prison riot.

This paper investigates the implications of multiple roles for the longevity of women. Drawing on a two-wave 30-year panel study of 427 wives and mothers in upstate New York, we use event history techniques to test the effects of both the number and the nature of roles on the duration of women's lives. We find that social integration, defined by the number of roles occupied, promotes longevity, but that one form of integration--membership in voluntary organizations--is especially salutary.

Boswell	American Sociological Review	51	3	1986-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 352-371	American Sociological Association	fla		Between 1852 and 1882, Chinese immigrants to the U.S. faced periodic outbursts of extensive discrimination. This was a period of transition from petty-commodity to capitalist relations, when producers became proletarians. In the course of this transition, emerging working-class solidarity was recurringly disrupted by ethnic antagonism by white workers against Chinese competitors in the labor market. By the 1870s, white small-business owners who employed white labor and competed against employers of Chinese labor (many of which were Chinese capitalists) had formed a political alliance with white workers in the Democratic Party which secured passage of the 1882 Exclusion Act banning further immigration of Chinese workers. The pattern of discrimination against the Chinese is analyzed from a split labor market perspective in order to explain the sources and outcomes of ethnic competition under conditions of unequal labor costs. Split labor market theory is expanded to include analysis of the reproduction of split labor market conditions and alternative sources of labor market segregation with emphasis placed on the effects of market crowding, a self-perpetuating racist discourse, and state action.

Supportive of Wirth and Stouffer, findings suggest that urbanims per se increases tolerance for a variety of groups whose members hold unpopular if not deviant ideas and interests. Also supportive of Wirth and Stouffer, rural-urban migration is found to increase tolerance, but contrary to Stouffer, urban-rural migration is found to be unrelated to tolerance. It is concluded that Wirth's view of the influence of urbanism on tolerance as permanent is supported, but that Stouffer's culture-shock hypothesis is not.

Kohn, Carmi Schooler	American Sociological Review	51	3	1986-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 372-390	American Sociological Association	fla		We examine the relationship between a central aspect of schooling--educational self-direction--and students' personalities. The data are from a small but substantially representative nationwide sample of white students in the seventh grade through the fourth year of college. We separately assess the reciprocal effects of educational self-direction and two non-cognitive aspects of personality--self-directedness of orientation and sense of distress. As hypothesized, educational self-direction positively affects self-directedness of orientation and negatively affects distress; distress, in turn, negatively affects educational self-direction. We also evaluate the complex interrelationships of educational self-direction, cognitive functioning, self-directedness of orientation, and distress. Educational self-direction affects all three facets of personality, its impact on cognitive functioning being in substantial part indirect, through self-directedness of orientation and distress. The findings have implications for our understanding of work in school and its link to work in the labor force.

Presser	American Sociological Review	59	3	1994-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 348-364	American Sociological Association	fla		I extend the research on how employment schedules affect family life and which factors determine a husband's share in household labor. I present a new specification of the concept of  available time  among dual-earner couples--the amount of overlap (in hours) in spouses' employment schedules and whether a spouse works day, evening, night, or rotating shifts. I show that variations in employment schedules are significant determinants of a husband's share in traditionally female household tasks. Also important are certain aspects of spouses' resources, gender role ideology, and stage in the life course. Interpretations of these findings take into account whether it is the husband's and/or wife's hours performing household tasks that are affected by these variables, since husband's share depends on both. The data come from the 1986-1987 National Survey of Families and Households, and my findings support the view that modest increases in husbands' participation in household labor may result from the growing diversity in employment schedules among American workers.

Massey	American Sociological Review	54	5	1989-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 790-808	American Sociological Association	fla		Within the Caribbean region, racial identity forms a multicategory continuum from white to black, whereas in the United States it is a dichotomy of black versus white. Many Caribbean Hispanics, therefore, reject a strict racial dichotomy and select some category intermediate between black and white when asked to identify themselves racially on the U.S. Census. Using 1970 and 1980 census tract data, we show that these people display a low degree of segregation from white Hispanics and a high degree of segregation from both black Hispanics and non-Hispanic blacks. They are highly segregated from Anglos, however, suggesting that people of mixed racial ancestry are accepted by white Hispanics on the basis of shared ethnicity but are rejected by Anglos on the basis of race. Black Hispanics are highly segregated from all groups. These findings have changed little over time and persist despite socioeconomic controls. Although both race and ethnicity remain potent factors in American life, results underscore the special salience of race in U.S. society.

This paper demonstrates how macro-micro links in a theory of gender stratification can put societal problems in context and show how these problems are reflected in individual lives. Industrialization disturbed gender stratification patterns when macrotrends in mortality, education, fertility, labor force participation, and artificial infant feeding (which enabled a baby to survive separation from its mother) increased women's productivity compared to men's. But the same trends so increased the cost of children that population maintenance has become a problem in the West. Measures to stabilize fertility must spread childrearing costs more widely, thereby improving women's status.

Friedkin	American Sociological Review	58	6	1993-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 861-872	American Sociological Association	fla		I examine the relationship between interpersonal power and influence during the resolution of an issue in an organization. Controlling for elementary bases of power (rewards, coercion, authority, identification, and expertise), I investigate three bases of power that arise from the structure of social networks (cohesion, similarity, and centrality). An analysis of longitudinal data on actors' bases of social power, frequency of interpersonal communications, and interpersonal influences indicates that cohesion, similarity, and centrality have significant effects on issue-related influence net of the elementary power bases. The effects of the structural bases are mediated by the frequency of issue-related communication. The primary structural determinant of the frequency of issue-related communication is network cohesion.

Using prejudice toward blacks as the outcome measure, an analysis of national survey data for the years between 1972 and 1985 indicates that (a) consistent with Wirth's and Stouffer's arguments, urbanites and non-Southerners are more racially tolerant than their nonurban and Southern counterparts; (b) contrary to some previous research, the net effects of urbanism on tolerance have increased over time while region effects have decreased; (c) the effects on tolerance of urban to nonurban migration confirm Wirth's notion of the permanence of urbanism's influence but not Stouffer's culture-shock hypothesis; and (d) the implications of regional migration are more complex than previous research has indicated.

Data from the National Survey of Families and Households demonstrate that, among recently-divorced men and women, a substantial percentage had been romantically involved with someone other than their spouse prior to divorcing. Merging microlevel data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth with aggregated Public Use Microdata from the 1980 U.S. Census, we examine the impact of marriage market characteristics and other contextual variables on the risk of marital dissolution, net of individual-level predictors. Proportional hazards models reveal that, among non-Hispanic Whites, the risk of dissolution is highest where either wives or husbands encounter an abundance of spousal alternatives. Increased labor force participation among unmarried women and high geographic mobility rates in the local area also increase marital instability. Our results suggest that many persons remain open to alternative relationships even while married, and that the supply of spousal alternatives in the local marriage market significantly increases the risk of marital dissolution.

Leifer	American Sociological Review	53	6	1988-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 865-878	American Sociological Association	fla		In most settings, roles are given and role behavior is a salient ideal for retaining status. Yet in settings that admit only like actors, coveted roles often can only be acquired through interaction. During the interaction prelude to role setting, claiming a coveted role through unilateral role behavior is strategically vulnerable. A distinct action ideal, called local action, is needed to avoid role claims until there is evidence a claimed role will be conferred. Ironically, local action suppresses role differentiation when used by both sides in interaction. The exchange of local actions yields a self-perpetuating prelude, or stable balance, between actors who each seek coveted roles that would put the other in less desirable complementary roles. Local action thereby provides an explanation for balanced reciprocity and casts new light on balance as a purely local phenomenon. No longer must generalized role behavior (i.e., the norm of reciprocity) be invoked where roles are not given. The coexistence of two salient ideals (local action and role behavior) should alert us to discontinuities in behavior as settings and ideals change, as well as to the pockets of ambiguity that are a part of larger role structures.

Williamson	American Sociological Review	50	6	1985-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 782-799	American Sociological Association	fla		This study examines the determinants of spending on public pensions. Unlike other programs, pensions benefit an easily identifiable, high voting group--the aged--and may be especially amenable to their political influence. With that in mind, we draw out predictions of industrialism and class theories for the explanation of public pension expenditures. The explanations are tested with data on 48 nations, at all levels of political and economic development, for four time points (1960, 1965, 1970, 1975). Pooling the data allows multivariate analysis of appropriate determinants both within and across different groups of nations, and detailed analysis of advanced industrial democracies. Industrialism variables such as percent aged, social insurance program experience, and family size have dominant effects. However, the effects of percent aged increase with political democracy, suggesting that the aged wield political power in increasing pension expenditures. Class variables, in contrast, have little or no effect on pensions, suggesting the importance of age politics over class politics in the spending for this program.

Teachman	American Sociological Review	52	4	1987-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 548-557	American Sociological Association	fla		Family background has been prominent in models of educational attainment. In most research, family background has been measured by socioeconomic indicators (e.g., parents' education, family income), to the exclusion of other family characteristics that also affect educational attainment. This paper argues that parents use resources to create a home environment conducive to higher attainment in education. Data from the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972 are used to test several hypotheses concerning the impact of educational resources. The results support the notion that educational resources increase educational attainment.

Garnier, Bruce Fuller	American Sociological Review	53	6	1988-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 824-837	American Sociological Association	fla		Human capital theory postulates that school expansion should foster economic growth, but credentialing theory questions such a relationship. We hypothesize that some conditions must obtain before educational expansion can have an affect on economic growth. First, the curriculum must be standardized and a large proportion of the age cohort beyond grade six must be enrolled for a sufficient period of time. Second, education and the economy must be linked. Third, the state must ensure that the quality of educational offerings is maintained. We use France to test these hypotheses because, starting in the late 19th century, the state played an important role in linking education and the economy. The state also followed a number of specific policies to ensure quality. The analysis from 1825-1975 supports our hypotheses. We compare the French findings to the U.S. findings and find them consistent.

We first propose a micro-model specifying a broad set of individual incentives to participate; then we contend that political events and changes in the social context together with existing coordinating mechanisms produced the large-scale demonstrations in 1989. Most of our hypotheses are tested using a representative survey of Leipzig's population in the fall of 1990 that focuses on the 1989 protests. Among the incentives, only political discontent, weighted by perceived personal political influence, has a major impact on participation in the demonstrations. The expectation of repression was irrelevant. Opposition groups were unable to shape the incentives of the population, and incentives for their members to participate were weak, whereas negative incentives prevailed for members of the Socialist Party. Incentives to participate were concentrated in personal networks of friends. Thus, personal networks were the most important contexts for mobilizing citizens. A  spontaneous coordination model  explains how discontented citizens met at particular times and places, and why few incentives were necessary to prompt participation in the demonstrations.

However, the absence of change in persistent poverty masks a number of important changes in the demographic and statistical structure of persistent poverty. These changes include increasing inequality in the distribution of permanent socioeconomic position, greater dependence on social assistance, and the more familiar demographic changes such as increased numbers of single-parent families, higher educational attainments of parents, and decline in family size.

Ross	American Sociological Review	60	3	1995-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 449-468	American Sociological Association	fla		Women report greater distress than men, but do women genuinely experience greater distress, suggesting a heavier burden of hardship and constraint? Or do they merely report the feelings in standard indexes more frequently? Perhaps women discuss their emotions more freely. Or perhaps the indexes tap  feminine  emotions such as depression rather than  masculine  ones such as anger. This study analyzes data from a 1990 U.S. sample of 1,282 women and 749 men. Results show that men keep emotions to themselves more than women, and that women express emotions more freely than men. However, these factors do not explain the effect of sex on reported levels of distress--an effect that remains significant with adjustment for these factors. Our results also contradict the idea that the sex difference in distress would diminish if the indexes of distress contained more items that tap anger. Adjusting for emotional reserve and expressiveness, women experience anger more often than men, as they do sadness, anxiety, malaise, and aches. In fact, being female has twice the effect on the frequency of anger that it has on the frequency of sadness. Women report feeling happy as often as men, but adjusting for emotional expressiveness reveals a negative effect of being female on happiness. Overall, women experience distress about 30 percent more often than men. We discuss the possibility that drug abuse and heavy drinking mask male distress, but find little evidence that those behaviors ameliorate distress. We conclude that women genuinely suffer more distress than men.

Lawler, Jeongkoo Yoon	American Sociological Review	58	4	1993-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 465-481	American Sociological Association	fla		We examine the impact of power on the development of affective commitment in dyadic relations within a minimal exchange network. Theory stipulates that in repeated negotiated exchange (1) equal power and integrative bargaining issues increase the frequency of exchange between actors, (2) frequent exchange generates positive emotions that are attributed to the focal relation, and (3) positive emotion increases the propensity to form an affective commitment to the relation. When commitment develops, actors tend to remain in a relation despite alternatives and to provide benefits beyond those necessary to maintain the relationship. An experimental test supports the theory and suggests the conditions under which instrumental exchange relations become expressive. We discuss implications for the role of dyads in exchange networks.

By analyzing a set of national surveys that were conducted between 1955 and 1989 and using a research design that separates the effects of period and duration of marriage, I examine changes over a longer period of time than any previous study has done. Multivariate loglinear analyses show that intermarriage between Protestants and Catholics has increased dramatically since the 1920s, while intermarriage between different educational groups has decreased. Currently, the social boundaries that separate educational groups seem to be stronger than the boundaries that separate Protestants and Catholics. In addition, there is some evidence that interfaith marriages have become increasingly homogamous with respect to education, suggesting that education has replaced religion as a factor in spouse selection.

Kevin Neuhouser	American Sociological Review	57	1	1992-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 117-135	American Sociological Association	fla		An elite framework is often used to explain democratic stability in post-1958 Venezuela. I argue that a class-compromise model is more useful, not only for understanding the Venezuelan case but also for explaining the variation in regime outcomes across regions of the capitalist world economy and within the periphery. To contrast the utility of the two models, I analyze Venezuela's political history since 1945. To demonstrate the more general usefulness of the class-compromise model, I compare Venezuela to two countries in which democratic regimes were destabilized--Brazil in 1964 and Chile in 1973. Democratic stability occurs when state managers are able to balance capital accumulation and consumption policies. Democratic instability occurs when state managers lack sufficient resources to satisfy the consumption demands of a mobilized working class without threatening the accumulation interests of capitalists.

Maume, Jr.	American Sociological Review	61	4	1996-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 541-556	American Sociological Association	fla		Over a decade ago, Wilson (1980) argued that race was declining in significance as a determinant of economic rewards. In response to his critics, he asserted that young Blacks in the 1970s were closing the earnings gap with their White counterparts; he gave no indication that he thought the trend toward racial parity in earnings would reverse. We tested Wilson's assertion by comparing the net effect of race on hourly wages for two cohorts of young workers. We also decomposed the racial gap in hourly wages into a discrimination component and a nondiscrimination component. Our samples were taken from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics in 1976 and 1985. Contrary to Wilson's proposition, we show that: (1) The effect of race, net of controls, increased during this time, and (2) the proportion of the racial gap in hourly wages due to discrimination (i.e., not explained by racial differences in measured qualifications) increased between 1976 and 1985. We contend that the government's retreat from anti-discrimination initiatives in the 1980s resulted in organizational discrimination against Blacks and contributed to a reversal in the postwar trend toward racial parity in earnings.

Ridgeway	American Sociological Review	52	5	1987-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 683-694	American Sociological Association	fla		Linking nonverbal behavior to influence in task groups has been interpreted as evidence that behavioral dominance is the basis of status. Challenging this interpretation, this paper proposes that both the power processes that underlie status formation and the structural implications of dominance hierarchies indicate that expectations about task performance will be the usual basis of status in task groups. Furthermore, while some nonverbal behavior communicates dominance, it is not linked to influence. Influence results from nonverbal task cues that affect the performance expectations of an actor. An experiment tested this hypothesis by measuring the influence achieved by a female confederate in a three-person female group. As expected, the confederate was most influential when she displayed high-level task cues. When she displayed a high level of dominance cues, the confederate was not more influential than when she displayed submissive or low-task cues. The results suggest that status is a collective product of the entire network of group members, rather than an aggregate of pairwise competitions among members.

Pescosolido	American Sociological Review	51	4	1986-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 523-540	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper documents a recurring but often overlooked pattern in adult socialization and proposes the mechanism that produces this regularity in role assimilation. Three broad stages (Expectancy, Disillusionment and Reconciliation) produce a curvilinear pattern over time in the adoption of  ideal-typical  role attitudes, beliefs and values. The migration of individuals to and from urban areas and their medical care preferences provide a unique case for the illustration of two crucial, organizational elements of the socialization process: context and networks. Data from Taiwan (1970, N = 618) indicate that for both in-migrants and out-migrants, preferences for western as opposed to indigenous medical care parallel proposed changes in initiate networks. The pattern is neither smooth nor unidimensional nor the same between contexts. Additional analyses that incorporate Granovetter's (1973)  strength of weak ties  idea are consistent with the network explanation. The concluding discussion focuses on factors that might influence the duration of and fluctuation between socialization stages.

Handcock	American Sociological Review	59	2	1994-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 205-219	American Sociological Association	fla		Two positions dominate the debate over the recent increases in economic inequality in the United States. The  job-skill mismatch  thesis attributes rising inequality to growth in the number of high-skill, high-wage jobs that leaves less-skilled workers behind. The  polarization  thesis, in contrast, argues that the service shift generates growth in the number of both high-wage and low-wage jobs, and declines in the middle. Standard summary measures of distributional inequality cannot discriminate between these depictions of where job growth is occurring. We propose new methods for measurement that provide both summary and detailed information about the distributional shifts in earnings and a framework for statistical inference. Using data from the Curent Population Survey (CPS) on yearly earnings from 1967 to 1987, we show that the trends in distributional inequality vary considerably by race, gender, and time. While the evidence provides more support for the polarization argument, this thesis needs refinement if it is to account for the variations in changing inequality observed here.

I suggest that these questions are historically contingent, and conceptualize the state as an organization that is affected by its own structure and agendas, and by the political coalitions in its environment. I evaluate competing explanations of state business policy formation by examining policies that affected the U.S. steel industry between 1940 and 1989. There are four major findings: (1) organizations that represent political coalitions of capitalist groups in the state's environment form the basis of collective action and constitute the means to exercise political and economic power; (2) differential rates of accumulation affect business unity; (3) business policy is affected by the state's structure and agendas and the way in which its agendas conflict or coincide with the interests of the steel industry; (4) as the state's authority extends over more areas of economic activity and as it establishes more complex enforcement structures, state autonomy declines because these new structures provide class segments with legitimate mechanisms within which class members can exercise their political power.

Variation in marital coital frequency over the life course as well as across cohorts may thus affect many aspects of the social life. This paper reports estimates of the ceteris paribus cohort-free effects of spouses' ages, marital duration, and contemporaneous period influences on coital frequency, as well as of the correlations between coital frequency and birth- and marriage-cohort factors. These estimates are obtained by (a) using the properties of the fixed-effects statistical model in order to separate the effects of cohort influences from the age/duration and period effects and to control for the operation of couple-specific unobservables, and (b) using strictly monotonic nonlinear transformations in order to separate the effects of wife's age, husband's age and marital duration.

This article does so by using a unified ecological dataset that includes measures of suicide, crime, homosexuality, and cultism. Substantial negative associations between rates of church membership and rates of crime and cultism survive statistical controls, while the negative associations with suicide and homosexuality do not. The results pose a severe challenge to simple theories of the role of religion in society.

Weakliem	American Sociological Review	55	4	1990-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 574-590	American Sociological Association	fla		The radical theory of economic segmentation holds that systems of labor control affect labor's capacity to pursue its interest. The system characteristic of the leading sectors of U.S. industry provides immediate benefits to workers at the cost of undermining their control over work and their ability to mobilize for collective action. The radical theory implies that the system initially increased wages but eventually led to a decline because of these long-term effects on control and organization. I examine wages in U.S. manufacturing industries between 1947 and 1987, first distinguishing groups of industries within which wages move together. Data on collective bargaining provisions are then used to verify that the resulting groups are related to systems of labor control. Regressions are fit for wage changes in each group and significant period differences are found in the core group. The pattern of parameter shifts supports the radical theory's predictions.

Leicht, Michael Wallace	American Sociological Review	57	2	1992-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 243-258	American Sociological Association	fla		We test several hypotheses derived from Marxist crisis theories regarding the impact of macroeconomic performance on the distribution of income between labor and capital in the United States during the period 1950 to 1980. Using annual data on compensation, profits, and employment, we estimate the short-term effects of cyclical variations in unemployment, inflation, growth, and capacity utilization on labor's income share. With an additive decomposition of labor's income share, we then estimate the extent to which the observed effects can be attributed to changes in compensation, output, and employment. We find little support for the hypothesis that tight labor markets increase labor's income share by increasing the bargaining position of labor. The hypothesis that labor compensation lags behind profits over the business cycle is supported. Our results therefore favor the  realization failure  rather than the  reserve army  theory of cyclical crisis.

Weil	American Sociological Review	52	3	1987-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 308-324	American Sociological Association	fla		Though researchers have begun to prefer cohort and period-cohort accounts of generational differences to life-cycle accounts, clear and unambiguous empirical support for either has been rare. Mannheim's theory of generations suggests that this failure may result from seeking cohort or period-cohort effects where the historical events that generate them do not have sufficient impact. Therefore, the aftermath of a revolutionary event is investigated--Nazism in Germany. Cohort and period-cohort effects without life-cycle effects were found in opinions on democracy and Nazism in West Germany in the decades following World War II. The  Nazi generation  lagged initially in embracing the new West German democracy, but its views subsequently converged with those of other cohorts. Transitions to democracy in several other countries are discussed briefly.

Race-relations theories ignore the state entirely. This research views the local state as constrained by the superordinate national state and by local class structures. The racial nature of the local state, here termed the racial state, was designed and defended by plantation operators and white farm owners. Institutional features of the racial state conformed to the interests of planters and white farmers. These two classes also impeded the national state's dismantling of the racial state during the 1960s. Racial differences in enfranchisement were closely articulated with the local class structures typical of labor-intensive cotton agriculture rather than with competition and status variables suggested by race-relations theories.

I investigate the possibility that prior views of the world, or  ideology,  affect responses to new information, and hence changes in opinion. I focus on one type of ideology, levels of class consciousness, using data from opinion surveys of British manual workers in the election years of 1964, 1966, and 1970. Results from a latent class model indicate that changes in political and economic opinions vary with degree of class consciousness. Workers who identified with the working class but held negative attitudes toward unions became considerably more pessimistic about economic conditions and the policies of the Labour Party. This group's behavior may represent either instrumentalism or a perceived conflict between the interests of the working class and the interests of society as a whole. These results cast doubt on conventional views of the relationship between workers' economic interests and support for parties of the left.

Kanouse	American Sociological Review	50	2	1985-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 263-272	American Sociological Association	fla		Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972, this paper examines the impact of the transition to parenthood on the amount of time men and women spend on paid employment. The majority of women have jobs prior to pregnancy; most leave these jobs as the pregnancy progresses, so that only one woman in five remains employed in the month that the child is born. Some women return to work, but by two years after the birth employment rates reach only 60 percent of their previous levels. In the absence of parenthood, the proportion employed would have steadily increased, so that the real employment deficit due to parenthood exceeds that implied by a comparison of employment before and after the birth. The most important contributor to women's decreased work activity following parenthood is withdrawal from employment. On virtually all our measures, fathers show higher levels of work activity than we would expect in the absence of the first birth, but this  parenthood effect  predates the pregnancy by a substantial amount.

I examine four structural characteristics of tracking systems: selectivity, electivity, inclusiveness, and scope. I predict that differences in these characteristics lead to variation in between-track inequality (the achievement gap between tracks) and school productivity (average achievement of students in the school), net of the composition of the student body. In addition, I hypothesize that Catholic schools have less inequality between tracks and higher productivity overall than public schools. I test the hypotheses using data from High School and Beyond, a national survey of high schools and their students. The results show that schools vary significantly in the magnitude of track effects on math achievement, and they differ in net average achievement on both math and verbal tests. Schools with more mobility in their tracking systems produce higher math achievement overall. They also have smaller gaps between tracks in both math and verbal achievement when compared to schools with more rigid tracking systems. Moderately inclusive systems also have less between-track inequality in math; and overall school achievement tends to rise in both subjects as inclusiveness increases. The hypotheses about Catholic schools are also supported, especially for math achievement. The way Catholic schools implement tracking partially accounts for their advantages.

However, this assessment is based on the impact of retired worker (contributory) benefits. The distributional effects of noncontributory spouse and widow benefits, through which two-thirds of older women make their claims, are markedly different. Class-based theorists examining the stratifying effects of welfare state programs focus on sources of bias that are disadvantageous to lower-class workers while feminist accounts highlight sources of bias that are disadvantageous to women. Using published and unpublished summary data made available by the Social Security Administration, I demonstrate that while historical sources of gender bias linked to contributory benefits have dissipated somewhat, race, class and marital status biases linked to noncontributory benefits persist. Ultimately, benefits linked to marital status are potentially as exclusionary for some groups of women as are benefits linked to contributions for other groups. I reject arguments that spouse and widow benefits may be justified as rewards for unpaid domestic work or as mechanisms to target the poor. Noncontributory benefits are unrelated to domestic labor and systematically are most advantageous to middle-class and upper-class married White women who have never contributed to the system.

Dawes	American Sociological Review	58	6	1993-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 787-800	American Sociological Association	fla		We outline a model of how freedom to choose between playing and not playing particular Prisoner's Dilemma games can (1) increase social welfare and (2) provide relative gains to intending cooperators. When cooperators are relatively more willing to play, they will interact more frequently with each other and their payoff per encounter will be higher--potentially higher than that of intending defectors. Because the cooperate-cooperate outcome produces more wealth than any other, optional entry will increase social welfare. We report laboratory data showing: (1) Social welfare and the relative welfare of intending cooperators are higher when subjects are free to choose between entering and not entering particular Prisoner's Dilemma relationships; and (2) this difference is a consequence of intending cooperators' greater willingness to enter such relationships, not because of any capacity to recognize and avoid intending defectors. We speculate about the cognitive processes that underlie this result.

We focus on concern with finding purpose and meaning in life and the basis on which meaning is derived, including connection to others and contribution to their well-being, and economic success that involves embracing the market values of materialism and competition. We develop three measures of value orientation: (1) compassion, which reflects concern and responsibility for the well-being of others; (2) materialism, which reflects emphasis on material benefit and competition; and (3) meaning, which reflects philosophical concern with finding purpose and meaning in life. We find substantial gender differences on all three measures. Females in our sample are more likely than males to express concern and responsibility for the well-being of others, less likely than males to accept materialism and competition, and more likely than males to indicate that finding purpose and meaning in life is extremely important. These differences are observed throughout the period from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s and show little sign of decreasing; they are evident across social class subgroups and cannot be explained by gender differences in religiosity or the perceived availability of social support.

Faulkner	American Sociological Review	58	6	1993-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 837-860	American Sociological Association	fla		We analyze the social organization of three well-known price-fixing conspiracies in the heavy electrical equipment industry. Although aspects of collusion have been studied by industrial organization economists and organizational criminologists, the organization of conspiracies has remained virtually unexplored. Using archival data, we reconstruct the actual communication networks involved in conspiracies in switchgear, transformers, and turbines. We find that the structure of illegal networks is driven primarily by the need to maximize concealment, rather than the need to maximize efficiency. However, network structure is also contingent on information-processing requirements imposed by product and market characteristics. Our individual-level model predicts verdict (guilt or innocence), sentence, and fine as functions of personal centrality in the illegal network, network structure, management level, and company size.

The resulting data are used both quantitatively and qualitatively to explore hypotheses related to generational effects, life course, and collective memory. Broadly speaking, different cohorts recall different events or changes, and these memories come especially from adolescence and early adulthood. The reasons for mentioning various events and changes also differ across cohorts in ways that indicate that generational effects are the result of the intersection of personal and national history.

Because of collective interests and strong personal ties, the family facilitates the pooling of labor power and financial resources. Enterprising immigrants draw on these resources when establishing and operating small businesses. Our findings also show the importance of human capital/class resources in accounting for immigrant self-employment. Although foreign-earned human capital is usually not highly valued in the host labor market, immigrants successfully use this human capital to achieve business ownership. Interethnic variation in personal human capital and family composition accounts for a substantial portion of the observed interethnic variation in self-employment.

Theories of power and exchange suggest alternative hypotheses about how structural power and strategic action are related to each other and to outcomes. These are tested with data from a series of experiments in which power relations are based on control over rewards and punishments. Both structural power and its strategic use have substantial effects on exchange outcomes, but structure and action are related only weakly to each other. Their relative effects on exchange outcomes vary with the base of power. Structural power has stronger effects on reward exchange, and strategic action on punishment exchange. The asymmetry of reward exchange in the relation, the traditional measure of power use in power/dependence theory, is affected by both.

Moore	American Sociological Review	60	1	1995-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 126-140	American Sociological Association	fla		Numerous studies link education to liberal attitudes, such as tolerance and support for civil liberties, yet explanations for this association remain controversial. Three models have been proposed: Liberal attitudes result from cognitive and personality development, from direct socialization, or from  ideological refinement.  Tests of these models predicting social attitudes have failed to resolve the controversy. We argue that the mechanism by which education influences attitudes can be clarified by considering economic attitudes as well as social attitudes. We focus on attitudes toward homeless people, an issue with both social and economic components. Using a nationwide survey, we find that education is associated with greater tolerance for homeless people but less support for economic aid to the homeless. These data support the socialization model, and we conclude that education socializes students to the  official culture,  which in the United States includes values of equal opportunity and equal respect--but not equal outcomes.

The literature on moral reform movements argues that such movements are instances of either cultural or status defense unrelated to class conflict, or that they defend strictly material class interests. I argue that the importance of culture in the reproduction of class positions implies that moral reform movements are a form of class politics. Variation in strength of support for the anti-vice movements is explained as a response to the political and social threat posed by the immigrant working class and mediated by cultural consensus within the upper class.

The study design explicitly considers the possibility that prior emotional functioning may influence the risk of unemployment and chances for reemployment. We document substantial effects of unemployment on distress as well as positive emotional effects of reemployment. Contrary to initial expectations, the probability of reemployment is unrelated to baseline emotional functioning. The elimination of elevated distress after reemployment suggests that the worst psychological effects of job loss can be minimized if opportunities exist for reemployment.

The competition perspective argues that Whites in general, and the White working class in particular, benefit materially from racial economic subordination. The class exploitation perspective, in contrast, argues that elite Whites benefit and working-class Whites lose. We argue that competition and exploitation perspectives are theoretically limited because they neglect the historically and structurally contingent nature of distributional struggles and political-economic development. Our analyses suggest that in the U.S. South the interaction between elite structure and racial composition shapes racial economic subordination and the degree to which working-class Whites or local elites gain from racial inequality. While these findings are partially consistent with class exploitation and competition perspectives, they suggest important revisions.

Portes and others advance the  enclave-economy hypothesis  that immigrants in an enclave-labor market receive earning-returns to human capital commensurate with the earning-returns of immigrants in the primary labor market. This position contradicts the classical assimilation view that segregation retards the economic achievement of minorities. However, our analysis of earnings among Cuban and Chinese immigrants suggests that the enclave-economy hypothesis is only partially correct. The hypothesis is supported in the case of entrepreneurs, but the assimilation perspective better explains the earnings of employees. We suggest a reformulation of the enclave-economy hypothesis that is sensitive to important differences between immigrant-workers and immigrant-bosses.

Two issues are explored: the relationship between consensual unity among elites and political stability, and the role of elite settlements and two-step transformations as routes to consensual unity of elites. I argue that the proponents of the new paradigm fail to establish the priority of political explanations over social structural explanations for global patterns of political stability. They also fail to develop theories of wide explanatory power from the central contentions of classical elite theory.

Using data from the 1985 General Social Survey, I find that these gender differences arise in part from dissimilar social structural locations of men and women, which lead to distinct opportunities for and constraints on the formation of close personal ties. Most gender differences in network composition disappear or are considerably reduced when variables related to employment, family, and age are controlled. However, some gender differences remain. Women have a larger number, higher proportion, and greater diversity of kin ties in their personal networks than men, even when compared with men in similar social structural positions.

I extend this work on  social framing  by describing the construction and selection processes that explain why media writers appropriate some frames but not others, and why some frames  resonate  with broad cultural beliefs. I analyze the rhetoric in media accounts from 1985 to 1990 of the dangers posed to children and society by heavy metal music and rap music. I also examine the images used to amplify each genre of music. Although both genres have lyrical and performance elements focusing on sex and defiance of authority strong enough to evoke a moral outcry, they evoke quite different reactions. I argue that the racial composition of the music's audiences and producers shape the way the two genres are perceived.

A better understanding of this problem may offer important insights into the current events in the former Yugoslavia. Using marriage registration data, I apply log-linear models to distinguish the effects of changes in the marginal distribution of spouses' traits from patterns that reflect the association between these traits. The results show that the widespread perception that intermarriage occurred frequently is an exaggeration--over the last three decades there has been no clear increase in the rates of intermarriage. Further, social barriers have hindered interactions (and intermarriage) among three cultural traditions present in the former Yugoslavia--a Western tradition among Slovenes and Croats, who have been under Austro-Hungarian rule and are predominantly Catholic; an endemic Balkan cultural tradition among Serbs, Montenegrins, and Macedonians, who have been part of the Ottoman Empire and are predominantly Eastern Orthodox; and a Middle-Eastern cultural tradition among most of the Islamic populations.

Gartrell	American Sociological Review	51	2	1986-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 201-213	American Sociological Association	fla		The strongest empirical evidence of dependency has been the finding of an increasingly negative effect of extensive foreign capital penetration on the subsequent economic growth of the host. This long-run structural effect of foreign direct investment is based on cross-national comparisons over the period 1960-75, with samples of up to ninety-one countries. To date, the structural effect has not been replicated for rich (core) country samples. We suggest that the failure of researchers to substantiate the dependency effects in the core hinges on two problems: 1) the need to identify  mature economic dependency  as a variation in the structure of core economic development, and 2) the need to model mature dependency with longitudinal rather than cross-national research designs. In this paper, we use time series data to illustrate the long-term negative effects of American direct investment on post-World War II economic growth in Canada.

Leicht	American Sociological Review	54	6	1989-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1035-1047	American Sociological Association	fla		Some researchers view unions primarily as functioning to increase earnings inequality among the working class while others see them as threatening employers so that they raise wages for unorganized workers and minimize working-class inequality. Threat effects are defined as the tendency for nonunionized employers to respond to the threat of unionization by increasing the earnings and benefits of their workers. This paper probes a contextual method for estimating the effects of unionization on the earnings of unorganized workers. This method controls for structural characteristics that affect workers' earnings and incorporates information about the organizational strength and vitality of specific unions. Using data from seven manufacturing industries in Indianapolis, the results suggest that (1) unionized workers' earnings positively affect the earnings of unorganized workers in unionized plants, (2) unionized workers' earnings negatively affect nonunionized workers' earnings in nonunionized plants, and (3) when plant size is controlled, unionized workers' earnings have no significant effect on the earnings of nonunionized workers in nonunionized plants. These results highlight the complexity and difficulty of estimating the effects of union threat and their importance for understanding earnings inequality in the workplace.

Robinson, Ana-Maria Wahl	American Sociological Review	55	6	1990-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 912-928	American Sociological Association	fla		Analyzing manuscript schedules of the Census of Manufactures for Indianapolis in 1850, 1870, and 1880, we test two models of industrial employment and wages. According to the textile model, the development of the factory system and labor-saving technologies allowed employers to substitute low-paid, unskilled women and children for high-paid, skilled men, driving down men's wages. According to the craft production model, 19th century factories, including those using machinery extensively, continued to rely on craft systems of production similar to those in artisan shops, i.e., they employed male craft workers and paid them well. We find no evidence that women or children were substituted for men as capital-intensity and firm size increased or that the presence of women or children in an industry drove down men's wages. Child workers, overwhelmingly boys, were replacing men, but not in the sense that the textile model assumes. Rather, boys were in training for skilled industrial trades held by men. Thus, children resembled men in their employment patterns rather than women.

We examine how this group is treated by a public housing eviction board. Statistical analysis suggests Samoans are discriminated against in financial cases. Interviews indicate, however, that Samoans are disadvantaged largely because their excuses are not persuasive and would not be regardless of the ethnicity of the tenants making them. In this sense Samoans are treated  like any other tenant,  and illegal discrimination, as defined by the Fourteenth Amendment, has not occurred. But Samoans make unpersuasive excuses more often than other tenants because excuses that are reasonable in the context of Samoan culture do not seem reasonable to judges from a different culture. Thus among tenants behind in their rent, Samoans fare worse than do non-Samoans, much as they might fare if board members held anti-Samoan prejudices. We call this implication of cultural hegemony  cultural discrimination  and note the dilemmas it poses, not the least of which is that it makes problematic the very concept of discrimination.

Quantitative studies in sociology, using official statistics to test hypotheses, focus on the effects of urbanization, religious affiliation and other reasons why individuals commit suicide. Observational studies examine legal, organizational and professional factors that lead to misclassifying suspicious deaths, but they fail to consider their effects on the causes of suicide. Surprisingly, no study has examined whether the social construction of rates biases attempts to test sociological theories of the cause of suicide. We attempt to bridge this gap by organizing criticisms of suicide rates theoretically, framing them in a measurement error model, and introducing a number of techniques to control for misreporting and  correct  official rates. Using several independently collected data sets for county groups (N=404) in the United States for 1970-71, we find that systematic misreporting exists. However, misreporting in the official statistics has little discernible impact on the effects of variables commonly used to test sociological theories of suicide. Our results suggest a number of theoretical refinements necessary for pursuing further quantitative and qualitative studies of suicide.

Flewelling	American Sociological Review	53	3	1988-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 421-431	American Sociological Association	fla		The growing research on comparative studies of homicide in the United States reveals significant methodological advances but inconsistent findings. A major goal is to identify sources of inconsistency and accumulate more valid and reliable results. This analysis empirically examines a major problem with most previous comparative studies--the failure to disaggregate the overall homicide rate into more refined and conceptually meaningful categories of homicide. A theoretically integrated model is presented that guides the calculation of disaggregated rates and the derivation of hypothesized relationships. Using data from the Comparative Homicide File (CHF), the analysis shows that indicators of resource deprivation and social disintegration tend to have significant effects across subtypes of homicide, although the magnitude of the effects varies, while indicators of violent cultural orientation are confined to homicides resulting from interpersonal conflicts. The implications of the results for comparative research on homicide are discussed.

Kerckhoff	American Sociological Review	51	6	1986-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 842-858	American Sociological Association	fla		The effects of the organization of schools on individual student performance have been the focus of investigations for many years. One area of inquiry that has led to mixed results and varied interpretations is research on the effects of ability grouping within schools. The present study has several advantages over previous research on this question. (a) It is based on a large, national sample. (b) It examines the effects of both school types (some of which serve students selected according to ability) and ability grouping within school types. (c) The analysis involves comparing students who have been separated into ability groups with those who have not been so separated. (d) The analysis and interpretation take into account the effects of ceiling and floor effects of the measures used. The results support the general hypothesis that students in high ability groups gain more and students in low ability groups gain less over a five-year period than they would be expected to gain if they had not been separated into ability groups. It is suggested that one of the reasons similarly strong effects have not been consistently observed in the United States is that we have not collected the kinds of information needed to conduct the type of analysis presented here. However, ability grouping in British and American schools may serve different functions. The several types of schools and the ability groups within them may have more clearly defined  charters  in Great Britain, the higher levels serving to  sponsor  their students' movement toward elite adult statuses more effectively than their American counterparts do.

Benford	American Sociological Review	51	4	1986-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 464-481	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper attempts to further theoretical and empirical understanding of adherent and constituent mobilization by proposing and analyzing frame alignment as a conceptual bridge linking social psychological and resource mobilization views on movement participation. Extension of Goffman's (1974) frame analytic perspective provides the conceptual/theoretical framework; field research on two religious movements, the peace movement, and several neighborhood movements provide the primary empirical base. Four frame alignment processes are identified and elaborated: frame bridging, frame amplification, frame extension, and frame transformation. The basic underlying premise is that frame alignment, of one variety or another, is a necessary condition for participation, whatever its nature or intensity, and that it is typically an interactional and ongoing accomplishment. The paper concludes with an elaboration of several sets of theoretical and research implications.

Leiber	American Sociological Review	54	2	1989-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 263-274	American Sociological Association	fla		Merton's theory of strain and crime has withstood half a century of theoretical controversy, but recent disillusionment with its empirical verification has led many to reject it as a viable explanation for delinquency. We question that the theory has been falsified by evidence to this date, on the grounds that conceptual reinterpretations have differed from Merton's original statement. We examine the empirical and theoretical implications of the reconceptualization of strain implied in its current operationalization. Analyses of self-reported juvenile data indicate that the overall predictive validity of a measure based on the dysjunction of economic goals and educational means surpasses the more common measure of a dysjunction between educational aspirations and expectations. The theoretical implications of this measurement issue are illustrated in the context of ongoing controversy about the redundancy of strain, when commitment alone (a partial component of strain) seems adequate to predict delinquency.

Baer	American Sociological Review	57	2	1992-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 139-152	American Sociological Association	fla		We test the hypothesis, dating from the work of Weber and Tocqueville, that Americans are more likely to become involved in voluntary associations than people of other nations. Compared to previous work, we employ more recent data and consider more countries. We also examine several different measures of membership levels: all memberships versus working memberships as well as membership including and excluding church or union memberships. Cross-national differences are examined before and after controls for education, employment status, size of community, gender, marital status, and age. Results show Americans at or near the top on most measures of membership, although this ranking drops significantly when church membership is excluded and drops even further when only working memberships are examined. In these instances, people from several countries, including Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Norway, and Sweden, equal or surpass the membership levels of Americans, especially when controls are introduced. Some alternative interpretations of the cross-national differences in voluntary association activity are considered.

S. workers and that this commitment gap may be an outcome of the greater prevalence of  welfare corporatist  structures in Japanese firms. With data from a survey of over 8,000 employees in nearly 100 plants in Japan and the United States, we estimate a multilevel model of the processes shaping individuals' organizational commitment and work satisfaction. Consistent with a theory of  corporatist  control, we find that participatory work structures and employee services ( paternalism ) are more typical of Japanese plants yet function in both countries to raise commitment and morale. Other evidence for and against predictions from  corporatist  theory is discussed.

Sayed	American Sociological Review	54	6	1989-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1019-1034	American Sociological Association	fla		This research joins sociological and demographic traditions in a study of villages as contexts for contraceptive behavior in rural Egypt. Using survey data collected in the early 1980s, we explore the effects of village, household, and individual characteristics on contraceptive use and expectations about future use. Primary interest centers on the effects of the village variables, including the structure of the village economy, modernization of agriculture, level of school participation, and family planning service environment. The analysis demonstrates clearly that contraceptive behavior in rural Egypt varies systematically with these features of the village setting. In addition, village effects appear to vary according to characteristics of individual respondents: women respond differently depending on the stage in their reproductive career and their motivation to regulate fertility.

This paper uses panel regression analysis to assess the validity of the three perspectives in sixty-one underdeveloped countries between 1960 and 1980. The results provide some support for each theory and also contradict previous studies that do not consider several important variables. Thus, future studies must transcend current theoretical and ideological particularism to avoid incomplete or false representations of urbanization and underdevelopment.

Macy	American Sociological Review	55	6	1990-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 809-826	American Sociological Association	fla		The Oliver-Marwell theory of  critical mass  is a prominent solution to the  free-rider  problem that plagues collective action in large groups. I reformulate the theory as a stochastic learning model in which cooperative responses are shaped by the social sanctions and cues generated by the responses of others. This relaxes four assumptions in the original formulation: that the actors are rational, decisions are isolated events, outcomes are deterministic, and public goods have pure jointness of supply and  collective profit.  Computer simulations then show how adaptive actors become trapped in a suboptimal equilibrium and how they escape through attainment of critical mass.  Start-up  problems arise from accommodation to social costs and not from low returns to early contributors as previously believed. Simulations also identify a new dilemma of group size and show why solidarity tends to emerge in response to crisis. Finally, normative solidarity appears to be a consequence rather than cause of critical mass but may promote recovery from random deviance.

Blau	American Sociological Review	56	2	1991-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 237-249	American Sociological Association	fla		Recent empirical research on the effect of religious pluralism on church membership in the United States has produced contradictory findings. One study reported that religious pluralism had a positive effect on the prevalence of church membership, whereas another study reported a negative effect. Using county-level census data for 1910, 1920, and 1930, we find that religious diversity generally retards church membership. We also extend research on this topic. We introduce a measure that summarizes the effect of church adherence in surrounding counties on church adherence in a particular county. Examining the effects of a variety of social and economic conditions on church membership, we find that, in the early decades of this century, church participation was high in counties for which there are indications of social deprivation and marginality. Ethnic and religious diversity retard church membership and the positive impact of religious adherence elsewhere on a particular county's religious participation declines over time.

Surprisingly, given its universality, there are relatively few attempts to explain this phenomenon empirically. This article examines the extent to which gender differences in religious orientation can be attributed to the structural location of women in society. Three explanations to account for gender variations in religion are tested: (1) the child-rearing role of females, (2) lower levels of female work force participation relative to males, and (3) differing attitudes toward work and its relationship to family values. The analysis uses the nationally representative data collected in Australia in 1983 to show that the child-rearing role and differing attitudes toward work do not account for the greater religiousness of women. By contrast, the lower rate of female work force participation is an important explanatory factor. Possible reasons for this effect are discussed.

Tests for interaction between structural change and gender composition reveal that industrial restructuring translates into different job opportunities for men and women, which, in turn, differentiate their economic rewards. Both men and women benefited from the effects of industrial shifts and intraindustry occupational restructuring, but men benefited more from the entry of women into traditionally male-dominated occupations than did woman. Apparently the industrial transformation of employment accompanies a process which redefines gender boundaries so that job sex segregation persists as a feature of the employment structure.

They import hierarchical structures from larger society and help perpetuate them by creating inequalities in the ability to accomplish interactional goals. In this study of speaker transitions in six-person, task-oriented experimental groups, we explore the well-known finding that men interrupt women more frequently than women interrupt men. We ask three questions about the structure of interruptions. Who attempts to interrupt whom and under what conditions? How does the affective character of interruptions vary across speakers and groups? What determines whether an interruption succeeds? We find that gender inequality in these task-oriented discussions is created by a mixture of attempts to use power and of differential success. In their interruptions, men discriminate by sex in attempts and in yielding to interruptions by others. Women interrupt and yield the floor to males and females equally. The sex composition of the group affects interruption patterns in complex ways. Men interrupt men with supportive comments in all-male groups, but these supportive interruptions drop as the number of women in the group increases. Supportive interruptions also succeed in gaining the floor more often in single-sex groups. Taken together, the results suggest a mixture of status and conflict models and reaffirm the importance of group composition in interaction.

We study the case of the Chinese enclave in New York City, using three distinct operational definitions of the enclave--as a place of residence, place of work, and industrial sector. Regardless of the definition employed, there is considerable evidence of positive returns for earnings for male enclave workers from education, labor market experience, and English-language ability. By contrast, none of these human capital variables is positively related to income of female enclave workers. Implications of these results for comparative research are suggested.

DiPrete	American Sociological Review	55	5	1990-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 757-773	American Sociological Association	fla		Two strategies, linear aggression and loglinear models, have enabled sociologist to make great progress in the study of social mobility and stratification, but each has deficiencies. Linear regression models are insensitive to the multidimensional character of stratification, while loglinear models do not easily incorporate independent variables. I propose a class of constrained multnomial logit models for the study of social mobility that bridges the gap between these two approaches. Parsimony in specifying intercepts is achieved through standard methods for parameterizing interaction terms in loglinear and related models of social mobility. Parsimony in specifying the effects of covariates is achieved by partitioning covariates into groups within which effects are constrained to be proportional. The resulting specification consists of three types of parameters: (1) a reduced set of intercepts: (2) coefficients that convert the effect of each variable in a group into what may be thought of as a single group-specific metric; and (3) a set of scores for each group that specifies the impact of the group's covariates on outcomes. Examples are provided using data from the 1983 and 1987 Current Population Surveys.

These institutions consist of horizontal relationships between employers and unions on the one hand and vertical relationships between the union confederations and union affiliates on the other. Theories of class politics, the world market, and country size propose explanations of the development of corporatist institutions. Taken together, these theories characterize advanced capitalism in terms of the shared and conflicting interests of class actors and state actors. Robust regression analysis of data on 18 OECD countries shows that corporatist development is positively related to social democratic government and negatively related to country size. The effect of the world market on corporatist development receives only moderate support. These findings suggest that corporatism is more the outcome of parliamentary class conflict than industrial class collaboration.

Kluegel	American Sociological Review	55	4	1990-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 512-525	American Sociological Association	fla		Whites' explanations for the black-white gap in socioeconomic status are examined using General Social Survey data for 1977 to 1989. While there has been a significant decline in the percentage of whites attributing the gap to innate inferiority of blacks, individualistic explanations of the gap still predominate. Most individualistic explanations stress lack of motivation among poor blacks, and are widely held among whites who otherwise express little or no traditional prejudice. Whites' explanations for the racial economic gap influence their attitudes toward government policies to improve the status of blacks, independent of sociodemographic characteristics and prejudice. These results help explain a paradox of contemporary racial attitudes, and suggest that white public opinion has reached an era of stable acceptance of the black-white economic gap.

Much of the deviation is attributed to changes in the suburban ring. Using commuting patterns as an indicator of intrametropolitan systems of cities, I evaluate alternative specifications of metropolitan form and examine the network position of large suburban cities in 41 multinodal metropolitan areas. The results call into question both the monocentered specification of intrametropolitan relationships and more recent multinodal reformulations, suggesting instead that the metropolitan community is best viewed as a complex system of differentially dominant places.

We test hypotheses predicting that parental attitudes influence their children's behavior and that children's behavior alters their parents' attitudes. We use data from an intergenerational panel study of mothers and their children to specify models testing these predictions. Our findings support the hypotheses that (1) parental attitudes toward cohabitation influence children's behavior after controlling for children's own attitudes and (2) children's behavior influences their parents' attitudes. The empirical results also shed light on gender differences in the links between attitudes and behavior and possible causal links between aggregate level trends in family formation attitudes and behavior.

Denton	American Sociological Review	52	6	1987-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 802-825	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper examines trends in residential segregation for blacks, Hispanics, and Asians in 60 SMSAs between 1970 and 1980 using data taken from the 1970 Fourth Count Summary tapes and the 1980 Summary Tape File 4. Segregation was measured using dissimilarity and exposure indices. Black segregation from Anglos declined in some smaller SMSAs in the south and west, but in large urban areas in the northeastern and north central states there was little change; in these areas blacks remained spatially isolated and highly segregated. The level of black-Anglo segregation was not strongly related to socioeconomic status or level of suburbanization. Hispanic segregation was markedly below that of blacks, but increased substantially in some urban areas that experienced Hispanic immigration and population growth over the decade. The level of Hispanic segregation was highly related to indicators of socioeconomic status, acculturation, and suburbanization. Asian segregation was everywhere quite low. During the 1970s the spatial isolation of Asians increased slightly, while dissimilarity from Anglos decreased. Results were interpreted to suggest that Asian enclaves were beginning to form in many U.S. metropolitan areas around 1980.

We analyze the relationship between the structure of the airline network and employment growth in 104 metropolitan areas. Using network methodology, we document the structural changes that accompanied the expansion of the airline system between 1950 and 1980. Using regression analysis and nonrecursive models, we assess the effects of these changes in the airline network on metropolitan employment growth rates, focusing specifically on employment in manufacturing and producer services. Results indicate that position in the airline network has pervasive effects on metropolitan employment growth and that changes in network position are a cause rather than a consequence of this employment growth. We conclude that the reorganization of the airline network has been a critical factor transforming and integrating the spatial economy of the U.S.

Arnold, John Hagan	American Sociological Review	57	6	1992-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 771-780	American Sociological Association	fla		We develop a career model of prosecuted misconduct among lawyers. This model combines labeling theory's emphasis on the role of sanctions in structuring deviant careers with a focus on the asynchronic interaction between life cycle changes among precariously positioned actors and system conditions. This conceptualization suggests that complaints of misconduct against inexperienced solo practitioners are more prone to prosecution because of social conceptions and lay theories about lawyer misconduct, perceived threats to the profession's public image, and the relative powerlessness of these lawyers to defend themselves, especially during economic recession. An event history analysis of misconduct complaints against lawyers in a Canadian province confirms that complaints against inexperienced solo practitioners are more likely to move to prosecution during an economic recession. Our findings encourage the application of career conceptualizations to other research on deviance.

Pampel	American Sociological Review	58	4	1993-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 496-514	American Sociological Association	fla		Although evidence supports Easterlin's hypothesis that changes in relative cohort size account for swings in fertility in the post-war United States (at least until the 1980s), studies of fertility in Europe show only weak effects of relative cohort size on fertility. I argue that institutional structures of collective social protection and changes in rates of female labor force participation influence cohort relative economic status and thereby specify the effect of relative cohort size. These factors should help explain differences among nations in the effect of relative cohort size and the recent failure of fertility to increase. I test this interaction hypothesis using time-series data from 1949 to 1986 for 18 high income nations. Estimates from pooled cross-sectional time-series models show a clear positive effect of relative cohort size on fertility, but the relationship is weak in countries with collectivist social protection policies and in countries and periods with high rates of female labor force participation. Easterlin's socioeconomic-choice model can be extended to include socio-political factors that shape the meaning of relative cohort size to families and its impact on fertility.

(2) To what extent does the intensity of grievances before a critical incident, such as the reactor accident at Chernobyl, affect the extent of SMP after the incident? (3) Is the intensity of grievances related to the kind of SMP adopted? To answer these questions, 121 opponents of nuclear energy were interviewed in 1982 and 1987. The data indicate that grievances have a causal effect on SMP, but not a direct cross-lagged effect on protest. There was also a shock effect: the grievances of respondents with low dissatisfaction before Chernobyl increased more than those of respondents with high dissatisfaction. An aggression effect, i.e., high discontent leading primarily to violent or illegal SMP, was not ascertained. Protesters generally chose those actions they considered most efficacious for reaching the goals of the movement.

I survey cultural and economic variables, religious traditions, various electoral systems, the importance of a participatory civil society, and the methods through which political parties should be structured to maintain stability. I conclude that, because new democracies have low levels of legitimacy, there is a need for considerable caution about the long-term prospects for their stability. In many countries during the 1980s and early 1990s, political democratization occurred at the same time as a profound economic crises. Such conditions have already caused the breakdown of democratization in a number of countries. To attain legitimacy, what new democracies need above all is efficacy, particularly in the economic arena, but also in the polity. If they can take the high road to economic development, they can keep their political houses in order. The opposite is true as well: Governments that defy the elementary laws of supply and demand will fail to develop and will not institutionalize genuinely democratic systems.

Alwin	American Sociological Review	52	1	1987-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 83-95	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper explores the theoretical link between issues of distributive justice and satisfaction with material well-being. Assessment of satisfaction is based on two theoretical components of well-being: objective level of well-being and subjective reference standards that express expectations of level of well-being. The link between the two and their mutual influence on material satisfaction are reviewed in the context of theories of distributive justice, and their contribution to variation in measures of material satisfaction is examined using survey data from a national sample of working men and women (n = 2,385). The results demonstrate the importance of both objective and subjective components of well-being in explaining material satisfaction, thus supporting models of distributive justice. The data strongly support the hypothesis that the sense of justice regarding family income is linked to material satisfaction. However, the hypothesis that the extent of satisfaction depends upon measured departures from justice is only weakly supported.

An examination of the campaign contributions of corporate PACs in the 1980 Congressional elections shows that: (1) businesses did follow differing political strategies, with marked differences in their relative commitments to pragmatism and ideology, (2) At the level of particular races, however, business was usually highly unified, (3) The degree of unity actually found is greater than that which would be expected given the differing corporate strategies, implying the possibility that inter-corporate communication is used to reduce direct and open political conflict.

Special attention has been given to the potential effects of women's work and family life on their attitudes. This paper uses a large representative sample of American women to systematically evaluate these explanations for the first time. The evidence suggests that various aspects of women's family and work life do have consistent effects on women's support of a range of feminist goals, but the effects are smaller than several previous studies suggested. The analysis also suggests that the relative importance of these factors may be increasing and that work and family differences may become important lines of political cleavage in the future.

The choice between  collectivized  and  privatized  financial organization depends, in part, on which is more efficient--which minimizes transaction costs in organizing marital exchanges. Insights from the  new institutional economics  suggest that segregated assets are associated with lower expectations for marital continuity, fewer investments unique to the relationship, and ease in measuring contributions to the marriage. Data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation support the notion that couples organize their finances in order to minimize the transaction costs of married life.

One view is that prosperous urban notables (property-holders, office incumbents, elite professionals, entrepreneurs) held a coherent world-view at odds with that held by nobles. Others argue that the prosperous, nobles and non-nobles alike, shared a vision of social change. I use statements of grievances drawn up at the beginning of the French Revolution--the cahiers de doleances--to measure local variation in the extent to which nobles and prosperous commoners agreed on their programs for the future of France. This variation is used as the dependent variable in a multiple regression analysis to identify the social processes that helped either forge elite unity or drive the two groups apart. Unity was more characteristic of the prosperous areas of the kingdom and the regions more directly administered by the central government, while increasing town size promoted divisions. Mobility opportunities played no role. If the organized activities of intellectuals played a role, it was a unifying force (although a weak one). Finally, the more severe the immediate economic crisis, the more the elites found common ground, perhaps through common concern over revolt from below.

Somers	American Sociological Review	58	5	1993-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 587-620	American Sociological Association	fla		Democratic revolutions and global transitions have again thrust debates about citizenship and social class onto the sociological agenda. I use institutional and relational/network analysis to reconsider three tacit assumptions of these debates: (1) citizenship must be defined as a status; (2) capitalist development and citizenship formation must occur together; and (3) theories of citizenship must be based on the relationship between the state and capitalism. These assumptions are examined in T. H. Marshall's ([1949] 1964) classic historical sociological work, Citizenship and Social Class. By examining Marshall's thesis in its original empirical context of eighteenth-century English history, I demonstrate that varying patterns of institutional relationships among law, communities, and political cultures were central factors in shaping modern citizenship rights. Focusing on regional variation in citizenship practices among eighteenth-century English working communities, I suggest that: (1) citizenship should be redefined as an  instituted process  rather than a status; (2) the development of citizenship rights depended on the nexus of England's national legal infrastructure and the varying community capacities for participatory association; and (3) future research on citizenship and democratization expand beyond a focus on states and capitalism to include a sociology of relationships among public spheres, community associational life, and patterns of political culture.

Although it is derived from a model based on a modification and extension of Coleman's model of collective action, the new measure reflects major characteristics of Emerson and Cook's power-dependence theory, in which power emerges as a result of exchange based on actors' benefit-maximizing actions under network constraints on exchange. In the new measure, an actor's power depends on the number of exchange partners interested in the actor's resource, the extent to which the actor's partners are not interested or are less interested in others' resources than in the actor's, the power of the actor's partners as interdependent correlates, and the consequences of shifts in demand made by the actor's partners under the substitutability/complementarity of exchange relations among their multiple partners. I also show high consistency between power distributions predicted by the new measure and corresponding experimental results by Cook et al. (1983), Yamagishi, Gilmore, and Cook (1988), and Skvoretz and Willer (1993). Finally, using simulated exchange network data, I derive an enriched set of hypotheses about the structural and relational determinants of power centralization under closely substitutable exchange relations.

On the basis of existing theory and original ethnographies of 23 apparel firms, I develop a systematic scheme that more fully demarcates the unique features, functions, and sources of embeddedness. From this scheme, I derive a set of refutable implications and test their plausibility, using another data set on the network ties of all better dress apparel firms in the New York apparel economy. Results reveal that embeddedness is an exchange system with unique opportunities relative to markets and that firms organized in networks have higher survival chances than do firms which maintain arm's-length market relationships. The positive effect of embeddedness reaches a threshold, however, after which point the positive effect reverses itself.

Short, Jill Bouma, Zhai Fengying	American Sociological Review	60	1	1995-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 36-57	American Sociological Association	fla		We investigate the roles played by women and men in the emerging private sector in rural China. Specifically, we explore gender and the allocation of labor in household-run businesses in the rural areas of eight provinces. Data collected in the China Health and Nutrition Survey (1989) indicate that households with a large pool of female labor are at no advantage in starting and running a small business; rather, business involvement depends on the male labor pool, especially the presence of older men. Furthermore, if a household runs a business, men are more likely than women to work in it. Men apparently have led the development and expansion of household business in rural China, while women increasingly specialize in agricultural activities. Possible reasons for these findings are discussed.

Frey	American Sociological Review	52	2	1987-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 240-257	American Sociological Association	fla		Post-1970 population redistribution shifts in several developed countries have led to unprecedented population losses in their largest metropolitan areas. Migration processes that underlie these shifts in the United States are evaluated in light of two theoretical perspectives which foresee decidedly different redistribution tendencies. The regional restructuring perspective attributes recent losses to selective disinvestment in old manufacturing areas but anticipates gains to command and control center locations for expanded multilocational production organizations. The deconcentration perspective anticipates a pervasive diffusion of population associated with increasing locational flexibility of employers and residents. Redistribution shifts are evaluated by comparing the projected redistribution tendencies of the 1965-70 and 1975-80 migration streams for regions, metropolitan areas, and thirty-five individual metropolises. These comparisons support the deconcentration perspective.

Generally, the answers given are untheoretical, agnostic, or impressionistic--and unsupported by systematic empirical studies. The theory guiding our analysis is that a union with a democratic constitution, institutionalized opposition, and an active membership would tend to constitute a worker's immediate political community and sustain both class solidarity and a sense of identity between members and their leaders. As a result, such democratic unions would also defy the hegemony of capital in the sphere of production. Consistent with this theory, a contingency analysis of a sample of contracts won by CIO unions from 1938 to 1955 shows that those contracts won by stable highly democratic unions were more likely to be pro-labor than were those won by stable moderately democratic or stable oligarchical unions. The contracts won by unions with organized factions also were far more likely to be pro-labor than were those won by unions with sporadic factions or no factions. This pattern held both among the unions in the Communist camp and those in shifting or anti-Communist camps. Further, OLS analysis shows that constitutional democracy, organized factions, and Communist leadership (which approached statistical significance) each had independent effects in limiting the power of capital in the immediate production process.

They assert that nonvertical effects are of paramount importance in understanding the structure and process of stratification. By explicitly incorporating both vertical and nonvertical effects into the structural model of class mobility, I demonstrate the importance of both effects for understanding the structure of mobility chances within and between countries. Although vertical and nonvertical effects are equally important in explaining association patterns in individual countries, nonvertical effects are the major source of cross-national variation. Two nonvertical effects are particularly important: economic sector of employment--whether nonmanual, manual, or farm; and employment status--whether self-employed or not.

James	American Sociological Review	57	5	1992-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 635-650	American Sociological Association	fla		Data from North Carolina and South Carolina in 1910 indicate that racially segregated labor markets and racially unequal school systems affected school enrollment of black children and white children. The textile industry relied heavily on employment of white children, whereas the wood industry relied heavily on black adults, but employed few children of either race. Local governments provided inferior schooling opportunities for blacks. Results indicate that (1) school enrollment of white children was depressed by employment in the textile industry; (2) school enrollment rates for both races were unaffected by employment in the wood industry, probably because of the industry's low reliance on child labor; and (3) school enrollment rates for black children were depressed by inadequate educational opportunities. Findings suggest that industrial employment depressed school enrollment among those children who were potential industrial laborers. We question the assumption that school enrollment expansion in the United States was never constrained by a limited availability of educational opportunities.

These criticisms are shown to be either irrelevant, erroneous, or both. Retherford and Sewell further conclude that birth-order effects may be  a social phenomenon that does not exist.  We disagree. Far from contradicting the confluence model, the Wisconsin data lend further support to it.

Coleman	American Sociological Review	58	1	1993-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1-15	American Sociological Association	fla		In the eighteenth century a Great Transformation began--a transformation rooted in even earlier times and still in progress today. This transformation is characterized by the decline of primordial institutions based on the family as the central element of social organization and the replacement of these institutions by purposively constructed organization. Sociology is itself a product of this transformation, and the stages in the Great Transformation are mirrored by changes in the central foci of sociological theory and research. The decline of primordial social organization has been accompanied by a loss of informal social capital on which social control depended before the transformation. The design of purposive organization is necessary to compensate for this loss; this design is an emerging central focus for sociology. I introduce an example,  bounties on children,  to illustrate this point.

The guiding thesis is that (1) organizational factors systematically bias the information that actors have about each other, and (2) cognitive and motivational limits on the ability to process information do not allow actors to correct for the biased source of their information. The main hypothesis tested is that those who are high in an organizational hierarchy and who do high-skill-level tasks are perceived more favorably on selected role-related traits than are others of equal ability in the organization. The hypothesis is tested by creating an experimental corporate office. As predicted, clerks rate managers more favorably on selected traits than they rate fellow clerks, even though subjects were assigned to the two roles on a random basis. A structural-cognitive model best accounts for the results.

I construct a dynamic rational choice model that incorporates essential features of the sanction/norm link. The analysis suggests that much social control that appears to result from the sanctions of individuals derives instead from a form of group-mediated control termed compliance norms. In other contexts, intragroup control acts in opposition to external sanctions, resulting in a form of control termed opposition norms. According to the formal analysis, group responses to sanctions depend on the strength of sanctions, monitoring capacities, and the efficacy and cost of intragroup control.

Data from two surveys of youth in an Islamic, West African city, conducted five and nineteen years after national independence, indicate a convergence in the social forces that predispose attendance in the new and old systems. Using a standard nine-variable model of educational attainment, of five variables that had significant but opposite effects on Islamic and Western schooling attendance in the first cohort, only one significant opposing effect still operated in the second. Average years of attendance increased for both Western and Islamic schooling. Hypotheses are offered to explain the apparent structural accommodation of the two systems.

Heckathorn	American Sociological Review	58	3	1993-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 329-350	American Sociological Association	fla		Several studies have concluded that heterogeneity within a group facilitates the initiation of collective action. However, a recent analysis found that heterogeneity can either facilitate or impede collective action, depending on factors like the strength of the temptation to free-ride. Reconciling these conclusions is difficult because the earlier studies assumed that public goods are provided voluntarily, whereas the later analysis assumed that selective incentives like norms or laws can mandate cooperation. I examine the link between group heterogeneity and collective action in three regimes:  voluntary  systems, in which actors make unrestricted decisions to participate in collective action;  compliance  systems, in which actors create and enforce norms that compel others to participate in public goods production; and  balanced  systems, in which actors can create and enforce compliance norms or oppose such norms. The analysis reveals a complex link among group heterogeneity, collective action, and the type of regime. By fostering the organization of previously atomized groups and weakening the cohesion of high-solidarity groups, heterogeneity in contribution costs and valuation of the public good can reduce social power differentials.

Scott Frey, Linda Kalof	American Sociological Review	52	3	1987-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 380-390	American Sociological Association	fla		Researchers often use ordinary least squares regression (OLS) to analyze cross-national and other macrosocial indicator data. Although OLS is a flexible tool, its value depends on a number of assumptions that may be violated when applied to such data. One of the assumptions, the normality of the distribution of population residuals, is essential to efficient and unbiased estimation of regression coefficients and associated standard errors. Robust and bootstrapped regression estimation methods are not sensitive to the normality assumption. Use of these methods in a reestimation of three models from the cross-national literature indicates that OLS may perform poorly when used with cross-national data, and suggests that researchers should be cautious in their use of OLS with such data.

Breaking with much of the conventional literature on the cognitive development of preschool children, we argue that young children engage in interaction involving clear and often sophisticated understandings of racial and ethnic concepts and meanings. We discuss: (1) how racial and ethnic concepts are used to exclude or include others; (2) how racial or ethnic concepts are used to define oneself and others; (3) how power and control link to racial and ethnic understandings; and (4) how adults misperceive the racial and ethnic language and activities of children.

Shockey	American Sociological Review	54	5	1989-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 856-864	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper examines the hypothesis that  overeducated  workers receive lower earnings returns to a year of educational attainment than those who are not mismatched. Data from the Current Population Survey reveal that those who are mismatched actually receive higher overall earnings as well as higher absolute returns to a year of college. A structural model of earnings determination shows that the primary impact of advanced education among occupationally mismatched workers is through the attainment of jobs which offer higher pay. Among workers not mismatched, the main influence of schooling is direct rather than through job characteristics. However, the analysis also suggests the difference between mismatched and non-mismatched workers narrowed between 1972 and 1982.

This study utilizes the recently published Population Atlas of China to analyze the relationship among city size, economic development, and physical quality of life. These data are unusually complete, covering most of China's counties, districts, cities, and other administrative units (N = 2,306). The data analysis produces three major results. First, all-sized cities enjoy higher levels of economic development and physical quality of life relative to nonurban areas. Second, externally oriented coastal cities possess higher levels of economic development but not a better quality of life. Third, education and industrial employment contribute to both economic development and physical quality of life. Overall, these findings support modernization theories and some aspects of the dependency/world-systems perspective.

We examined this controversy using a variant of clique detection methods for business Political Action Committee (PAC) contributions to Congressional candidates in the 1980 election. One large group of corporations emerged based on shared conservative beliefs. No other groups nearly as large were detected. The findings were strong and robust for different levels of political similarity. The identified groups differed from each other economically in various ways, but these differences were not nearly as marked as the political differences. Overall, the evidence lends stronger support to the class rather than the pluralist perspective.

A sample of non-Hispanic white adolescents is drawn from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and analyzed using the nested logit method. The estimates show that self-esteem, locus of control, attitudes toward women's family roles, attitudes toward school, educational aspirations, and religiosity are associated with premarital pregnancy and its resolution in directions predicted by theory. The effects of self-esteem, attitudes toward school, attitudes toward women's family roles, and educational expectations are substantively important. Attitudes and related personality variables are important paths through which family background characteristics influence adolescent sexual and marriage behavior.

Williams	American Sociological Review	52	5	1987-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 653-664	American Sociological Association	fla		In this paper we study the determinants of the stability of schoolchildren's interracial and same-race friendships. We argue that classroom organizational features and student characteristics affect the cohesiveness of social ties with consequences for friendship stability. The hypotheses are tested on longitudinal data from 375 fourth-through seventh-grade students in 16 desegregated classrooms. Descriptive and inferential analyses show that interracial friendships are almost as stable as same-race ones. Further, while the stability of interracial and same-race friendships is influenced by classroom characteristics, it is more strongly influenced by ascribed and achieved characteristics of students. We conclude that while individual characteristics of students are the strongest determinants of interracial friendship stability, schools can adopt policies and practices that promote stable friendships between black and white students.

Whereas Kuznets identified the central role of sector dualism in the evolution of income inequality, I identify generalized sociocultural dualism as a second critical factor. Regression analyses based on 56 countries circa 1970 show that the curvilinearity of the inequality-development relationship is captured by a core model involving three processes: the spread of education, the demographic transition and generalized dualism, and labor force shifts and sector dualism. These three processes are represented in regression models by four variables that have significant effects on inequality in directions predicted by the core model: (1) secondary school enrollment (negative effect), (2) natural rate of population increase (positive effect), (3) sector dualism (positive effect), and (4) percent labor force in agriculture (negative effect). In general, the effects of variables that have been previously proposed as causes of income inequality vanish or are attenuated in the presence of this core model.

Stolte	American Sociological Review	52	6	1987-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 774-784	American Sociological Association	fla		Joining ideas from structural exchange theory and symbolic interaction theory, this paper addresses two questions: (a) How does a justice norm form? and (b) Why do variations among justice norms arise? Exchange theory clarifies the objective, structural, and largely  material  contexts in which justice norms originate. Symbolic interaction theory illuminates the subjective, intersubjective, and mainly  ideal  process through which justice norms emerge. Context variations in structural exchange (whether a setting entails distributive or productive exchange, equal or unequal power-dependence) help account for the formation of specific justice norms: equal opportunity, equality, status-rank inequality, need, and equity. We link our theoretical account to existing data and suggest experimental tests of its key implications.

Empirically, however, these transitions have been shown to produce a wide range of effects on mental health. Two kinds of models have been proposed to explain this variation: differential access to coping resources for dealing with stressful situations, and variation in the characteristics of transitions, such as their undesirability, foreseeability, etc. This paper emphasizes a logically prior issue: the role context within which the transition event occurs, specifically, the level of pre-existing chronic stress in the social role. The model tested envisions life transition events as nonproblematic, or even beneficial to mental health, when preceded by chronic role problems--a case where more  stress  is actually relief from existing stress. Nine transition events are studied: job loss, divorce, pre-marital break-up, retirement, widowhood, children moving out of the house, first marriage, job promotion, and having a child. Results support the hypothesis that prior role stress reduces the impact of life transition events on mental health for seven of nine events, with some differences in impact by gender. The findings provide a basic framework for interpreting the effects of varying types of life transitions, and argue against the presumption that life transitions are inherently stressful, suggesting instead a need to specify prior social circumstances that determine whether or not a transition is potentially stressful.

Coleman's (1990) theory of social capital emphasizes the roles of mothers and fathers in enhancing the life prospects of their children. However, Coleman's (1988) analysis of family migration and high school completion found an anomalous null effect of parental support. Elder's (1994) life course perspective on  linked lives  suggests that parental involvement with their children can have interactive effects as well as main effects in mitigating losses of community social capital resulting from a family's moves. Following this lead and using more elaborate measures, we find that the negative effects of family migration are significantly more pronounced in families with uninvolved fathers and unsupportive mothers. In these families the diminished social capital provided by parents does not compensate for the community social capital lost as a result of a family's move.

Miner	American Sociological Review	56	6	1991-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 772-785	American Sociological Association	fla		The persistence of organizational routines is studied by examining the survival of formalized jobs. Basic models of evolutionary change predict that organizational context, job-founding processes, and whether a job is novel affect job survival. Negotiated order and social interaction theories predict, however, that the relationship of the jobholder to the organization and to the job duties should also affect the persistence of formalized jobs, e.g., the initial incumbent's familiarity to the hiring department and whether the job was tailored to a specific person. These predictions are analyzed using partial likelihood analysis of the hazard rate of  job death  among 347 formalized jobs in a large organization over roughly a six-year period. Results support most of the predictions. The findings suggest that organizational evolution should be examined through systematic study of organizational routines.

Thompson	American Sociological Review	52	5	1987-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 665-682	American Sociological Association	fla		Research has failed to support the assumption that the academic difficulties of many minority and low-SES youth are due to their  outsider  standing relative to the middle-class culture that dominates schools. This study suggests that this proposition exaggerates the cultural hegemony of educational operations. Data on children in the first grade of a large, socially heterogeneous urban public school system show that not all teachers are given to status-related biases. Rather, teachers' own social origins exercise a strong influence on how they react to the status attributes of their students. In particular, low-status and minority pupils experience their greatest difficulties in the classrooms of high-status teachers. They are evaluated by their teachers as less mature, their teachers hold lower performance expectations for them, and their teachers score exceptionally low on perceived-school-climate measures. Moreover, year-end marks and standardized-test scores of such pupils apparently are depressed by these indicators of pupil-teacher social distance and teacher disaffection. A model of pupil-teacher background congruence is proposed as an alternative to the cultural hegemony framework, and the implications of such fit for the interpersonal dynamics of the classroom are discussed.

Mendoza	American Sociological Review	53	4	1988-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 569-584	American Sociological Association	fla		Nine themes on the effect of participation, identification, and career of fads, which appear in the collective behavior literature, are tested with data on 1,016 incidents of streaking at colleges and universities. Streaking diffused suddenly, gained quick acceptance, and was short-lived. Its diffusion corresponds to a positively skewed, rapidly accelerating slope, a brief and unstable asymptote, and a precipitous decline. The probability of streaking on college campuses increased with the institutional prestige of neighboring campuses that had experienced streaking, the number of sanctions they applied, the accuracy of the mass media coverage of previous streaking events, the level of complexity of previous streaking events, and the sociocultural heterogeneity of schools at risk of adoption. The research results support the predictions of the emergent-norm framework of collective behavior. Streaking incidents were heterogeneous suggesting that the oddness, impulsivity, inconsequentiality, novelty, and ahistoricity of fads have been exaggerated in the literature. Reformulations of the established conceptualization of fads are suggested.

Sewell	American Sociological Review	56	2	1991-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 141-158	American Sociological Association	fla		Confluence theory was originally developed to explain the negative effect of birth order on intelligence, as well as some peculiar effects of birth order on the intelligence of last-born children, in a large set of Dutch data. Subsequently the theory was elaborated to explain positive effects and nonlinear relationships between birth order and intelligence in other data sets. We test the mathematical form of the theory using aggregate data, between-family data, and within-family data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study and find no support for the theory. Fundamental flaws are identified in the statistical methods used to fit the model to the Dutch data. When the analysis is done correctly, the fit is very poor. An alternative analysis based on a within-family study design that uses sibling pairs indexed by birth order in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study finds no evidence of birth order effects on intelligence.

Andrew Greeley	American Sociological Review	54	4	1989-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 485-502	American Sociological Association	fla		The notion of the  Protestant Ethic  is reconceptualized to reflect theoretical expectations about the difference between the  Dialectical Imagination  and the  Analogical Imagination.  Protestants are expected to be individualist because of an imagination of society as  sinful and God-forsaken.  Catholics are expected to be communitarian because of an imagination of society as sacramental, that is, revelatory of God. The research question is whether the analogical/communitarian imagination can persist in a world of industrialization, modernization, urbanization, and homogenization. The issue was tested against data from seven nations (36 variables) with the null hypothesis that denominational background does not predict value orientation. The null hypothesis was rejected. A replication was attempted with a different data set from seven nations (36 variables) and the null hypothesis was again rejected. Further testing with data and 13 hypotheses from only the United States tested the null hypothesis that differences in religious imagery could not account for some of the variance between Protestants and Catholics on value measures. This null hypothesis was also rejected.

Ward, Xue Lan Rong	American Sociological Review	52	6	1987-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 856-862	American Sociological Association	fla		Feminist scholars have proposed that two types of links exist between research methods and gender. Female scholars have been thought to be more likely than males to choose qualitative methods because such methods are compatible with relational and emotional skills stereotypically associated with women. Qualitative approaches also have been thought to be especially appropriate for study of gender issues and women's experiences and to be an effective strategy for correcting androcentric biases in construction of social theory. We examine articles in 10 sociology journals in 1974-83. Most articles have been quantitative, but female authors have used qualitative methods more often than males. Writing about gender increased rather than decreased the likelihood of having used quantitative methods for both women and men. We suggest that papers focusing on gender and also using qualitative methods represented double nonconformity and hence were unlikely candidates for publication in mainstream journals.

The findings qualify both the official view and new class theory by showing two roads to Party membership. The first runs through the occupational structure, where workers, professionals, and technocrats are advantaged over individuals outside socialized production. The second runs through educational institutions, providing an educated few with extra opportunities to enter the Party. Results corroborate earlier conclusions that patriarchal allocation of political privileges continues in Hungary. Despite formal guarantees to the contrary, women are significantly underrepresented in the Party. Intercohort changes in membership recruitment show that older cohorts monopolize key Party positions, suggesting that a gerontocracy has emerged in Hungarian political life. Overall, results lend further evidence to the contention that some crystallization in inequalities has taken place in Hungary in the  second stage  of socialist development.

Balkwell	American Sociological Review	56	3	1991-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 355-369	American Sociological Association	fla		For more than 30 years, expectation states theory (EST) has been one of the most continuously active research areas in sociological social psychology. EST proponents have seen great potential in the theory, not only for producing a cumulative body of useful knowledge, but also for yielding explanations of phenomena beyond its original concerns. However, today this potential remains more promise than reality. A principal stumbling block has been that the relationship between expectation states and behavior is poorly developed theoretically and inconsistently manifested in those applications of the theory presently found in the literature. This critical link must be addressed in any effort to extend or apply the theory. In this paper I propose a general translation function to link expectation states and behavior. The proposed function is evaluated by applying it to three very different phenomena: social influence in dyads, participation in homogeneous informal group discussions, and participation in mixed-gender groups. Not only does this new general translation function enhance the theoretical integration of EST applications, but it leads to models that appear to give good accounts of empirical data.

I develop a theory of the dynamics of protest waves by comparing data on protests in West Germany between 1965 and 1989 with similar data from the Netherlands, Italy, and the United States. Striking similarities are noted among these different protest waves in the development of action repertoires, levels of repression and facilitation, and the involvement of different types of organizations. An explanation for these dynamic patterns combines external and internal factors: The interplay between facilitation, repression, and the chance of success defines a set of external constraints that combine with activists' choices among three strategic options--innovation, increased participation, or increased militancy.

Consistently high levels of participation reported in these data suggest an exceptionally religious population, little affected by secularizing trends. This picture of vitality, however, contradicts other empirical evidence indicating declining strength among many religious institutions. Using a variety of data sources and data collection procedures, we estimate that church attendance rates for Protestants and Catholics are, in fact, approximately one-half the generally accepted levels.

Using a new set of diagrammatic and verbal questions on class, we test our hypotheses on large, representative national samples in Australia (N = 6,177) and Hungary (N = 2,606). A full-information maximum-likelihood analysis strongly supports the hypotheses.

Eliason	American Sociological Review	60	2	1995-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 247-271	American Sociological Association	fla		In this article, I advance the theory of the labor market matching and attainment processes outlined in Sørensen and Kalleberg (1981) and provide an empirical test of the new specification. I extend the Sørensen-Kalleberg theory by elaborating (1) the role of the individual actions of employers and workers and (2) the relationship among resources held by employers and workers, resources desired by employers and workers, and the structure of control in the labor market. Consequences of these relations for reward attainment are discussed, and a model is derived for the matching and attainment processes. Data from the 1991 General Social Survey Work Organization Module are used to test these hypotheses. Consistent with the theory, the results show that in a closed system, the matching process accounts for over 50 percent of the variance in wage attainment for men and for women. Results also suggest that men benefit more than do women from closed systems originating solely from either job ladders or from skill. Closed systems originating from both job ladders and skill benefit men and women equally.

It is argued that the predominant forms of educational systems and forms of labor market segmentation in a society should have consequences for the structuring of career mobility. Empirical analysis is carried out in four steps for the three nations compared: Austria, France, and the United States. First, summary measures on total volume and direction of career mobility are presented; second, how structural positions (identified by use of a multidimensional classification) are connected to each other in terms of career mobility is explored; third, the main shifts in the distribution of men between entry to the labor force and time of inquiry are described; fourth, the flows of mobility between the several positions are analyzed in detail. Each of these types of analysis shows considerable differences among the three nations, differences that are related to the prevailing mechanisms of stratification and labor segmentation in each country.

These hypotheses are tested with data on 304 face-to-face groups from 10 communities. We find that friends are more similar on status dimensions than chance and that this homophily is produced both by the restricted opportunity structure offered by the group and by homophilous choices made within the group. Organizational heterogeneity leads to substantially greater dyadic status distance within the organization, while organization size consistently reduces dyadic status distance. At a given level of diversity, a larger group will permit more homophilous friendship pairing. However, correlated status dimensions create little reduction in dyadic social distance. In general, homogeneity within groups is the overwhelming determinant of homophily.

The first part considers possible models of science and argues that the most coherent is Imre Lakatos's methodology of scientific research programs. In his conception scientific knowledge grows on the basis of a hard core of postulates which are protected from refutation by the development of a series of auxiliary theories. Such a research program is progressive rather than degenerating if successive theories are consistent with the core, explain anomalies and make predictions, some of which are realized. In the second part I argue that with some qualifications the history of Marxism--from Marx and Engels, to German Marxism, to Russian Marxism, and finally to Western Marxism--conforms to the model of a progressive research program. In the third part I claim that deviations from the model, such as Soviet Marxism, are due to the breakdown of the reciprocal interaction between Marxism's heuristics and historical challenges.

Lehmann	American Sociological Review	60	4	1995-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 566-585	American Sociological Association	fla		I explore a set of contradictions crucial to Durkheim's work, that revolve around the issue of whether modern society (i.e., industrial capitalism) is structured according to the principle of individual mobility or the principle of caste. Specifically, I analyze Durkheim's theories of race, class, and sex to determine if they describe modern society in terms of individuals or in terms of castes. I find that Durkheim has both a dominant and a subordinate theory for each category. I also find that his theories of race and class differ significantly from his theories of sex. Durkheim's dominant theories of race and class and his subordinate theory of sex are theories of individuals in modern society. Conversely, his dominant theory of sex and his subordinate theories of race and class are theories of castes in modern society. I view Durkheim's social theory as a quintessential construction of modernity, and I view Durkheim as a quintessential liberal  of sorts.  I conclude that the contradictions at the heart of Durkheim's social theory are contradictions at the heart of modern society--and at the heart of liberal ideology.

However, results indicate that neither variable has a strong effect. Instead, the results support a pattern of  conditional occupational assimilation . If Hispanic men speak English at least  very well  and have completed at least 12 years of school, then their occupational achievement is close to that of the white non-Hispanic men with similar English fluency and schooling. Otherwise, the occupations of Hispanics are inferior to those of white non-Hispanic men with similar linguistic and educational characteristics. I also reconsider the concept of ethnicity effects on occupational inequality.

I test the world system paradigm as a general theory of development by focussing on three central constructs: world system role, dependency, and development. Data for five networks among 163 countries are used to operationalize world system role. The findings indicate that world system role can be operationalized in terms of role equivalence, yielding results closer to the theoretical model than the more commonly used structural equivalence measures. Contrary to theoretical expectations, world system role was more a function of absolute size of the economy than of level of development. The results weakly support the world system model of economic performance for the period 1980 to 1989. During this period, world system role had weak to moderate effects on several dependency indicators but did not directly affect economic performance. Dependency had a moderate effect on economic performance.

Yet demographic and social contexts of marriages can alter levels of ethnic endogamy. Though this study examines aspects of the demographic environment, it emphasizes the extent to which the language characteristics of the ethnic group members and their environment are associated with ethnic endogamy. Based on the 1976 Survey of Income and Education, the analysis shows strong relationships between endogamy and ethnic group size and geographic segregation. Moreover, ethnic endogamy is also associated with the relative size and vitality of the embedded non-English language subgroup. These results underscore the importance of non-English languages as sources of ethnic group cohesion and continuity.

In general, we find little evidence that the strength of previously identified predictors of divorce varies by marital duration. Variables such as race, wife's labor force participation, husband's employment, and urban residence seem to influence the probability of divorce, irrespective of the stage in the marital life course. The principal exception to this finding is the effect of wife's education, which appears to decrease the probability of divorce at early marital durations but to increase it at later durations. There is also suggestive evidence that the effects of home ownership and age at marriage may vary by marital duration.

Control relations between pairs of firms are modeled as a function of bilateral exchange relations and other firm- and dyad-level covariates in accordance with resource dependence and transaction cost theory. Firms with financial and commercial connections develop quasi-administrative ties through cross-shareholding and director transfers. Keiretsu networks have two sides: (1) horizontal relationships of mutual support and defense among large, established firms as indicated by reciprocity of control and exchange, homophily among  big-six  affiliates, and symmetry in the effects of purchase/supply transactions on control; (2) vertical structures of asymmetric exchange and control between financial firms and industrial firms, large firms and small firms, and  big-six  firms versus independent companies.

Using data on the children born to young women in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and data on week-by-week school enrollment for each mother, we examine the effects of early childbearing and the mother's school progress on the cognitive test scores of their three- to seven-year-old firstborn children. In separate multivariate analyses of African-American, Hispanic, and white children, mother's age at first birth and school enrollment status at conception were less important predictors of the child's cognitive score than was the mother's score on a test of cognitive achievement. Environmental factors, such as the degree of intellectual stimulation in the child's home, also predicted the child's test score and reduced the effect of the mother's cognitive score to nonsignificance among Hispanics. However, among African-Americans and whites control variables did not dislodge the strong and significant association between the mother's and child's cognitive scores.

Allison	American Sociological Review	52	5	1987-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 695-701	American Sociological Association	fla		Using a nationally representative sample of children aged 11-16 who had experienced their parents' marital dissolution, we examine the influence of paternal involvement on the child's well-being. For measures of academic difficulty, problem behavior, and psychological distress, there is little evidence that paternal involvement had either harmful or beneficial effects. Paternal economic support reduced somewhat the likelihood of problem behavior. Frequency of visitation and closeness of relationship to father showed no consistent influence on the available measures of child well-being.

Hauser, David B. Grusky	American Sociological Review	53	5	1988-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 723-741	American Sociological Association	fla		Krauze and Slomczynski (1986a) have proposed a non-negative decomposition of observed frequencies in a social mobility classification into  circulation  and  structural  components. In the present paper, we show that the Krauze-Slomczynski decomposition fails to satisfy minimal methodological requirements for cross-national comparisons. We explain why this decomposition cannot be used to test the Featherman-Jones-Hauser hypothesis of cross-national similarity in relative mobility chances. We also identify several questionable procedures in the empirical work of Slomczynski and Krauze (1987) and show how these procedures have affected their conclusions. In the second part of our paper, we discuss some advantages of the recently proposed Sobel-Hout-Duncan model in partitioning marginal effects in a mobility classification and use this model to embed the explanation of marginal effects in an illustrative analysis of cross-national variation in patterns of mobility. The results suggest that both economic and political development can reduce the strength of symmetric interactions between occupational origins and destinations. In addition, economic development increases asymmetric flows by upgrading and reshaping the occupational structure, whereas political development produces a net slowdown in some types of structurally induced mobility.

The data are from field experiments conducted in four cities--Milwaukee, Omaha, Dade County (Florida), and Colorado Springs. On the average, arrest is no more effective than other police interventions in reducing new incidents of violence. However, arrest has differential effects on subsequent violence depending on the background of the offender. The implications of the findings for social science theory and public policy are discussed.

Teachman	American Sociological Review	60	5	1995-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 762-774	American Sociological Association	fla		We explore the influence of education on cohabitation and marriage, formulating a theoretical framework that identifies ways in which the multiple dimensions of education influence both cohabitation and marriage. Our theoretical framework links education and union formation through the incompatibility of educational and marital and cohabiting roles, the opportunity costs of truncating education, and the accumulation of skills, knowledge, and credentials gained from school attendance. Using this theoretical framework, we formulate hypotheses about the influence of school enrollment and accumulation on marriage and cohabitation--hypotheses that are sometimes contradictory to what has been theorized in prior research. We evaluate our hypotheses using event-history data from a panel study of young adults. Results indicate that school enrollment decreases the rate of union formation and has greater effects on marriage than on cohabitation. School accumulation increases marriage rates and decreases cohabitation--a pattern suggesting that less educated individuals tend to substitute cohabitation for marriage, while those with greater school accumulation are more likely to marry.

Mainstream comparative research has neglected gender, while most feminist research on the welfare state has not been systematically comparative. I develop a conceptual framework for analyzing the gender content of social provision that draws on feminist and mainstream work. Three dimensions of qualitative variation suggested by power resources analysts are reconstructed to incorporate gender: (1) the state-market relations dimension is extended to consider the ways countries organize the provision of welfare through families as well as through states and markets; it is then termed the state-market-family relations dimension; (2) the stratification dimension is expanded to consider the effects of social provision by the state on gender relations, especially the treatment of paid and unpaid labor; (3) the social citizenship rights/decommodification dimension is criticized for implicit assumptions about the sexual division of caring and domestic labor and for ignoring the differential effects on men and women of benefits that decommodify labor. Two additional dimensions are proposed to capture the effects of state social provision on gender relations: access to paid work and capacity to form and maintain an autonomous household.

A theoretical framework, field observations, measurement criteria and procedures are presented to systematically describe variations in the complexity of collective locomotion. An explanation for these variations is drawn from the ideas of G. H. Mead and from the cybernetic model of W. T. Powers. Field observations and quasi-experimental evidence are presented in support of that explanation. Implications are discussed for the recharacterization and explanation of, and for future research on, other elementary forms of collective behavior.

Two models of cultural influence are developed, for settled and unsettled cultural periods. In settled periods, culture independently influences action, but only by providing resources from which people can construct diverse lines of action. In unsettled cultural periods, explicit ideologies directly govern action, but structural opportunities for action determine which among competing ideologies survive in the long run. This alternative view of culture offers new opportunities for systematic, differentiated arguments about culture's causal role in shaping action.

In this paper we focus on physical health as it is affected by two environmental elements: stress(or)es and resources. Data from a three-wave panel survey of a representative upstate New York community are examined by lagged causal relationships among these variables. The results show that (1) prior physiological conditions contribute directly to current physical symptoms, (2) stress and resource components of the psychological environment directly affect current physical symptoms, (3) social resources buffer both social stressors and psychological stress, whereas psychological resources buffer only psychological stress, and (4) psychological stress mediates the effects of prior social stressors and psychological resources. Clearly, stress is a complex process in which the three interacting environments affect well-being. Importantly, social resources play a buffering role relative to social and psychological stresses for physical well-being.

Hypotheses concerning the effects of industrial and occupational characteristics are derived using an eclectic approach which draws heavily on the labor market segmentation literature. Incorporated, as well, are ideas from neoclassical and institutional economics and from the occupational segregation and class approaches in sociology. The results raise some intriguing puzzles in terms of the contrasting effects of occupational versus industrial unionization and the opposite-signed effects of market power and size. Overall, the results provide a mixed evaluation of both the neoclassical approach and the dual economy approach to the explanation of black-white employment differences. Perhaps the most important result from this research is the demonstration of the existence and form of the systematic patterning of the allocation of blacks and whites to labor market positions, net of the influence of their individual work-related characteristics.

Frustration or grievance theory predicts that the movement would be stronger when and where old people suffered more. The challenger perspective expects greater growth when and where indigenous organizations of the aged already existed. Political opportunity theories expect challenges to flourish when and where openings are provided by members of the polity or by related challenges. We supply these theories by exploring the concept of political opportunity from an institutionalist perspective, assessing the model by comparing it to other perspectives to account for longitudinal and cross-sectional differences in the movement's strength. Although some support for each perspective was found, the movement was spurred most by indigenous organizations and different forms of political opportunity. We suggest an expansion of Tilly's polity model, to recognize that the political party system can influence challenges and that the structure and policies of the state can aid challenges as well as hinder them.

I model this structure by examining the pattern of shared membership linking specialities in American sociology in 1990. Cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling reveal seven coherent clusters focusing on deviance and control, setting and context, political and macrosociology, theory and culture, numbers, stratification and work, and social psychology/gender/medical sociology. The hierarchy of clustering reveals convergences, divergences, and potential influences among them. Centrality in the field corresponds to size of specialty, while dimensions of differentiation reflect shared substantive content.

Initial work employed dichotomous indicators and incorporated stability into political democracy measures. Evidence accumulated showing that this approach could adversely affect analyses, particularly in the study of income inequality. Despite this, some recent studies have renewed the flawed practices. We draw upon recent work to highlight the confusion that can result when democracy and stability are confounded and the problems with dichotomous indicators. We propose that stability is analytically distinct from political democracy and should be treated as such empirically, and we suggest ways to estimate incremental effects of political democracy. We further argue that political democracy is continuous and that measures of it should reflect this. It is important that the measurement history of this construct not repeat itself.

Frey	American Sociological Review	59	1	1994-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 23-45	American Sociological Association	fla		Residential segregation between blacks and whites persists in urban America. However, evidence from the 1990 Census suggests that peak segregation levels were reached in the past. We evaluate segregation patterns in 1990 and trends in segregation between 1980 and 1990 for the 232 U.S. metropolitan areas with substantial black populations. We review the historical forces that intensified segregation for much of the twentieth century, and identify key developments after 1960 that challenged institutionalized segregation. The results suggest that the modest declines in segregation observed during the 1970s continued through the 1980s. While segregation decreased in most metropolitan areas, the magnitude of these changes was uneven. Testing hypotheses developed from an ecological model, we find that the lowest segregation levels in 1990 and the largest percentage decreases in segregation scores between 1980 and 1990 occurred in young, southern and western metropolitan areas with significant recent housing construction. Because the black population continues to migrate to such areas, residential segregation between blacks and whites should decline further, but remain well above that for Hispanics or Asians.

Martinson	American Sociological Review	58	2	1993-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 210-232	American Sociological Association	fla		The positive association between growing up in a nonintact family and the risk of a first premarital birth has been interpreted by researchers as consistent with three hypotheses: (1) a childhood socialization hypothesis--that women who grow up in a mother-only family during early childhood are socialized in ways that result in a high risk of a premarital birth; (2) a social control hypothesis--that the supervision of adolescents is more difficult in single-parent families than in two-parent families; and (3) an instability and change hypothesis--that a premarital birth is a response to the stresses accompanying changes in a woman's family situation. Although these hypotheses imply distinct behavioral mechanisms, adjudicating between them has proven difficult, in part because researchers have relied on static measures of family structure. We use data from the National Survey of Families and Households and continuous-time hazard models to investigate the effects on premarital births of dynamic family measures that reflect a woman's family situation between birth and age 19. Our findings are consistent with the instability and change hypothesis, but provide little support for the socialization hypothesis and the social control hypothesis.

Robinson	American Sociological Review	54	2	1989-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 305-308	American Sociological Association	fla		Recent studies of collective political violence have overlooked international causal factors. This cross-national study of 46-51 nations (including analyses of influential cases) expends on earlier analyses by simultaneously examining both the  eternal  (international) and the  internal  (intranational) determinants of collective political violence. Regression analysis suggests that transnational corporate penetration, an international factor, contributes to increased political violence both directly and indirectly, through its effect on income inequality. We conclude that theoretical and empirical integration of intra- and international factors yields the most comprehensive explanation of the causes of collective political violence.

Using a special tabulation of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics that appends U.S. Census tract data to individual records, we analyze the movement of poor and nonpoor people into and out of five types of neighborhoods: white nonpoor, black nonpoor, black poor, black very poor, and racially and socioeconomically mixed neighborhoods. We find little support for the view that the geographic concentration of black poverty is caused by the out-migration of nonpoor blacks or that it stems from the net movement of blacks into poverty. Rather, our results suggest that the geographic concentration of poor blacks is caused by the residential segregation of African-Americans in urban housing markets.

Fararo, John Skvoretz	American Sociological Review	51	5	1986-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 591-602	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper unifies two strands of theoretical method in sociology. On the one hand, the structuralist or network program of research involves the fundamental rule that basic data and analytic procedures of sociology must focus on social relations. This leads to theories about structural stability or change, for example, although the network approach generally has been stronger on technique than on explanatory theory. An interest in theoretical explanation is the basis of the second theoretical method, which is drawn from the expectation states theoretical research program: namely, the idea of a dynamic co-causal process involving an unobservable relational construct termed an expectation state and an observable form of social behavior. The paper outlines the basic ideas of each of these two theoretical methods. It then proposes a new theoretical method which synthesizes the two and whose function is to provide a procedure for constructing explanatory models of social structural stability and change. This new method is termed  E-state structuralism.  An extended example is provided of how the method is used to construct a theory, first presenting the theory in axiomatic form and then empirically testing it. The subject matter of the theory is the over-time transformation in the structure of dominance relations among a small group of animals. The paper concludes with a review of how the generic method was exemplified in the particular theory.

Data from a national panel survey provide consistent evidence that men's and women's relationships differ. However, we find little evidence for the theoretical argument that women are more psychologically reactive than men to the quality of their relationships: Supportive relationships are associated with low levels of psychological distress, while strained relationships are associated with high levels of distress for women and for men. However, if women did not have higher levels of social involvement than men, they would exhibit even higher levels of distress relative to men than they currently do. We find little evidence for the assertion that men and women react to strained relationships in gender-specific ways--for example, with alcohol consumption versus depression.

We show how the state shapes the economy through the manipulation of property rights. The state's actions create pressures for change that lead actors to look for new forms of economic organization. The state also assists, leads, or constrains the process of selecting new forms of economic organization that emerge in response to these pressures, and it may or may not ratify these new forms. In contrast to the conventional literature on state economy relations that characterizes the U.S. state as having a weak capacity for successful economic intervention, we argue that property rights actions afford the U.S. state a previously unrecognized source of strength. Data come primarily from historical case studies of organizational transformation in the steel, automobile, commercial nuclear energy, telecommunications, dairy, meat-packing, and railroad sectors.

Heckathorn	American Sociological Review	61	2	1996-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 250-277	American Sociological Association	fla		Theoretical accounts of participation in collective action have become more divergent. Some analysts employ the Prisoner's Dilemma paradigm, other analysts suggest that different social dilemmas underlie collective action, and still others deny that social dilemmas play any significant role in collective action. I propose a theoretically exhaustive inventory of the dilemmas arising in collective action systems and show that five games, including the Prisoner's Dilemma, can underlie collective action. To analyze action within each game I use a dynamic selectionist model based on three modes of organization--voluntary cooperation, strategic interaction, and selective incentives. Social dilemmas exist in four of the five games, and conflicting accounts of collective action have focused on different games and modes of organization. As collective action proceeds from initiation to rapid expansion to stability, its game type varies in a way that can be precisely characterized as movement through a two-dimensional game-space. Finally, I distinguish between two ways of promoting collective action: One way focuses on resolving the dilemma within a particular game; the other focuses on changing the game so the dilemma is more easily resolved or eliminated.

Telles	American Sociological Review	59	1	1994-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 46-63	American Sociological Association	fla		In Brazil, the relationship between industrialization and racial inequality has been central to the discussion of post-Abolition race relations because the country has had high levels of racial inequality along with rapid but uneven industrialization. I examine how racial inequality in occupations varies with levels of industrialization across 74 Brazilian metropolitan areas in 1980. I find that industrialized areas have lower occupational inequality overall and especially in blue-collar occupations; but at higher occupational levels, racial inequality is either greater or is unaffected by industrialization. These results persist despite controls for the percent nonwhite in the population and educational inequality. Thus, this study supports the conventional view that race loses salience to class as industrial development increases, but only for blue-collar occupations; inequality at the white-collar level is unaffected or even increases with industrialization. Increased educational opportunity has effects on inequality similar to those of industrialization. Implications for Brazilian race relations are discussed.

Using a panel design on the population of whole schools, we tested determinants in three domains: motivation, social controls, and attractiveness. We obtained measures of variables from respondents, their identified friends, parents, and interviewers. We interpret the results within the framework of other findings from a hormone analysis of a partially overlapping sample. White males' initiation of coitus in early adolescence is dominated by motivational hormone effects and social attractiveness, with no observed effects of social controls. White females' initiation of coitus is dominated by the effects of social controls. We observed no effect of attractiveness, no hormone effects, and no effects of sexual motivation. Black females' initiation of coitus is dominated by their level of pubertal development (an attractiveness variable), with no observed effects of social controls.

Our initial prediction is that if those who hold a mixed stance about abortion are excluded, the remaining consistent supporters and opponents of abortion should show equal strength of feeling with regard to their respective positions. Using national survey data and several different measures of attitude strength, this prediction is disconfirmed: opponents of abortion are far more likely than proponents to regard the abortion issue as important. This finding holds true when religious affiliation is controlled. We further predict that blacks are less likely than whites to show strong feelings on the abortion issue, and this is confirmed. Finally, we predict that among pro-choice supporters, women will give greater importance to the issue than men, and this is also confirmed.

Do  male  occupations have more onerous working conditions that explain their higher earnings, as the neoclassical notion of  compensating differentials  suggests? Or do female occupations have low wages that are depressed by the sort of discrimination at issue in  comparable worth,  as sociologists have argued? To answer these questions, we use a model with fixed effects to predict the earnings of young men and women from a pooled cross-section time-series of the National Longitudinal Survey. Analyses are undertaken for both blacks and whites. A fixed-effects model is useful for answering these questions because it corrects for the selection bias that results from the tendency of persons who differ on stable characteristics that are unmeasured but affect earnings to select themselves into different occupations. We find little evidence that female occupations provide either low penalties for intermittent employment or high starting wages, the advantages human capital theorists have argued them to have.

Using both descriptive and inferential statistics, the author demonstrates a strong effect of participation on the subsequent lives of the volunteers and  no-shows.  The volunteers were more politically active throughout the sixties than the no-shows and remain so today. In addition, the volunteers are much less likely to be married and to have significantly lower incomes at present than are the no-shows. Besides reporting these basic findings, the author seeks through path analysis to explore the specific factors and processes that mediate the impact of participation in Freedom Summer on the later lives of the volunteers.

Robinson	American Sociological Review	53	1	1988-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 103-112	American Sociological Association	fla		Employing NORC data for 1974-1978 and 1980-1985, we evaluate three models of class identification for married men and women: (1) an  independence  model, in which one's own characteristics outweigh those of one's spouse; (2) a  sharing  model, in which equal weight is attached to one's own and one's spouse's characteristics; and (3) a  borrowing  model, in which one's spouse's characteristics are more important than one's own. In both decades, married men exhibit an independence model, in which only their own characteristics are salient, regardless of whether their wife works outside the home or not. From the 1970s to the 1980s, women shifted from a borrowing model to a sharing model. In the 1970s, employed or not, women attached more weight to their husband's than to their own characteristics. In the 1980s, employed women moved toward a sharing model, in which they take into account both their own and their husband's characteristics. An analysis of single men and women revealed movement away from a sharing model, in which both their own and their parents' characteristics are important, toward an independence model, in which only their own characteristics are salient. These changes are examined in light of economic and demographic shifts, political activism by women, and a possible trend toward greater individualism.

Macy	American Sociological Review	58	6	1993-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 819-836	American Sociological Association	fla		Rational-choice theorists stress the need for social control to overcome the free-rider problem in collective action. Critics counter that mechanisms for monitoring and enforcement are themselves public goods that presume collective action rather than explain it. In response, Heckathorn (1989) proposed an analytic solution based on  hypocritical cooperation  in which rational actors calculate the optimal allocation of resources between compliance with collective obligations and their enforcement. I relax these  forward-looking  behavioral assumptions and show how social control might evolve among  backward-looking  pragmatists. Computer simulations test the ability of various sanctioning regimes to generate cooperation as well as resist stampedes that risk overcooperation and needless sacrifice. External moral sanctions produce too little cooperation, while internalized sanctions produce too much. The best performer induced self-sustaining cooperation and then turned itself off once enforcement was no longer needed. This self-regulating system shows how collective rationality can obtain without the actors intending it.

The type of college entered shapes adult occupational status after controlling for years of education, mental ability, completion of B.A. degree, and other background variables. Compared to four-year college entrance, community college entrance for women depreciates the occupational return to each year of education. The more education a woman obtains, the more important type of first college becomes.

I view the relative frequency with which members of minority language groups use English vis-à-vis their non-English language as the outcome of two sets of factors: (1) the pressures and incentives that encourage non-English language Americans to use English, and (2) the demographic context that constrains the range of opportunities for non-English language Americans to interact with others who can speak their non-English language. The results, based on data from a large national survey, show that both sets of factors strongly influence patterns of language use. Further analysis shows that the demographic context influences patterns of language use in part by affecting the probability that non-English language Americans have spouses with facility in the same non-English language.

Mare	American Sociological Review	56	1	1991-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 15-32	American Sociological Association	fla		The tendency for persons with similar amounts of schooling to marry one another is linked to other aspects of marriage behavior and to patterns of social stratification. Whether persons with similar amounts of formal schooling marry each other depends partly on their preferences and partly on the structure of the marriage market. An important aspect of the marriage market is the timing of the transition out of school and into marriage. Marriages between persons with different amounts of schooling are less likely for highly educated persons and for persons who marry shortly after leaving school. Census and Current Population Survey data from 1940 to 1987 indicate that the association between spouses' schooling increased between the 1930s and the 1970s and was stable or decreased in the 1980s. This trend occurred partly because the time gap between schooling and marriage shortened from the 1930s to the 1960s as a result of increased educational attainment and lowered age at marriage; the time gap lengthened in the 1970s and 1980s as a result of increased age at marriage. After estimated trends in educational assortative mating are adjusted for the length of time between school leaving and marriage, some evidence of increased homogamy from the 1930s to the 1980s remains. This may result from increasing competition in the marriage market for wives with good prospects in the labor market. Increases in educational homogamy may increase inequality among families and in the socioeconomic achievement of their offspring.

We extend previous applications of social control theory by considering whether local life circumstances that strengthen or weaken social bonds influence offending over relatively short periods of time. We seek to determine whether formal and informal mechanisms of social control affect the likelihood of committing nine major felonies. We employ a hierarchical linear model that provides a within-individual analysis as we explore factors that determine the pattern of offending. The results suggest that meaningful short-term change in involvement in crime is strongly related to variation in local life circumstances.

I test this argument for murder and capital punishment by examining monthly homicide rates and television publicity devoted to executions from 1976 through 1987. Despite the power of television as a source of news in the United States, the results of this study do not support either the deterrence argument, which contends that capital punishment reduces killings, or the brutalization argument, which contends that capital punishment promotes killings. Homicide rates were not found to be related to either the amount or the type of execution publicity over the period.

Typically, they have not systematically distinguished primary group from formal organization effects. Consequently, it is not known what primary groups uniquely contribute to social behavior. An expanded organizational contingency theory of group structure is advanced which fills in this gap and shows that primary group theory and organizational contingency theory share a common framework. To demonstrate the power of this formulation, national data on mortality are analyzed to predict which causes of death can and which cannot be reduced by primary groups.

The theory is grounded in new data on women's rights activism from 1945 to the 1960s that challenge the traditional view that the American women's movement died after the suffrage victory in 1920 and was reborn in the 1960s. This case delineates a process in social movements that allows challenging groups to continue in nonreceptive political climates through social movement abeyance structures. Five characteristics of movement abeyance structures are identified and elaborated: temporality, purposive commitment, exclusiveness, centralization, and culture. Thus, social movement abeyance structures provide organizational and ideological bridges between different upsurges of activism by the same challenging group.

I argue for a fourth model, one that treats ideology as an episodic discourse, consisting of a general principles, concepts, symbols, and rituals that shape human actions in a particular historical period, and considers revolutionary phenomenon as a particular mode of historical action constituted by revolutionary ideology. The Iranian Revolution is examined to demonstrate the fruitfulness of the episodic discourse model.

Its mission is to examine the interdependence between (1) aging over the life course as a social process and (2) societies and groups as stratified by age, with the succession of cohorts as the link connecting the two. This special field of age draws on sociology as a whole and contributes to it through reformulation of traditional emphases on process and change, on the multiple interdependent levels of the system, and on the multidimensionality of sociological concerns as they touch on related aspects of other disciplines.

Kandel	American Sociological Review	50	4	1985-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 530-546	American Sociological Association	fla		Event-history analysis is applied to life and drug histories to specify the dynamic relationships between premarital cohabitation and the use of illicit drugs, and the effect of premarital cohabitation on entry into marriage. Use of marijuana and other illicit drugs increases the probability of cohabitation for men and women (role selection), while cohabitation reduces the use of marijuana among women (role socialization). Premarital cohabitation is more likely to end in separation than in marriage to the partner, especially among users of illicit drugs other than marijuana, blacks and students; marriage to the partner is more likely to occur among women who were highly religious in adolescence. Premarital cohabitation does not appear to undermine marriage as an institution since it does not lead to the postponement of marriage but predicts earlier marriage for men in general and for women highly religious as adolescents. Although the direct effect of marijuana use on entering cohabitation seems to result from unobserved factors common to both states, marijuana use seems to have an indirect effect on increasing the number of premarital cohabitants by postponing marriage and thereby lengthening the risk period for premarital cohabitation. The implications of these processes for the dramatic increases in cohabitation and illicit drug use observed in the last two decades are discussed.

Boies	American Sociological Review	54	5	1989-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 821-833	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper uses data from the Federal Elections Commission on political action committees, sponsored by Fortune 500 industrials in 1976 and 1980, to examine the determinants of business PAC size. Of the five groups of variables suggested by the extant PAC literature--availability of resources, free rider problems, material interests, previous campaign activity, and industry categories--just the measures of material interests have consistent and important effects on the level of firm political activity. Firms with the richest history of interaction with the state, top defense contractors, major acquirers of other businesses, and corporations prosecuted for criminal acts are the most politically active of large firms. Thus, while material interests are an important determinant of political action, this study suggests only interests tied to special long-term relationships with the state serve to increase the amount of political action taken by large firms. These results suggest that the pluralist-based theory of business political involvement, so widely accepted among contemporary PAC researchers, is of little utility for explaining firm differences in political activity.

Drawing primarily on 37 in-depth interviews with black middle-class respondents in several cities, I analyze public accommodations and other public-place discrimination. I focus on three aspects: (1) the sites of discrimination, (2) the character of discriminatory actions; and (3) the range of coping responses by blacks to discrimination. Documenting substantial barriers facing middle-class black Americans today, I suggest the importance of the individual's and the group's accumulated discriminatory experiences for understanding the character and impact of modern racial discrimination.

McCarthy, Mark Wolfson	American Sociological Review	61	6	1996-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1070-1088	American Sociological Association	fla		Mobilization of resources is a central concern among analysts of social movements. However, little research has focused on factors that influence the types and amounts of resources collective actors are able to mobilize. In this study, data from local social movement organizations opposing drinking and driving are used to assess the roles of agency (i.e., amount of effort), strategy, organizational structure, and nature of national affiliation in the mobilization of resources. Measures of agency consistently predict mobilization of volunteer labor, revenue, and membership. Strategy seems less important: An emphasis on victim services was positively related only to mobilization of members. Organizational structure, particularly the number of task committees, was consistently related to mobilization of volunteer labor, revenue, and membership. Affiliation with a highly visible and highly legitimated national organization, Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD), appears to have an energizing effect on local leaders while it dampens the effects of agency, strategy, and organizational structure. These results are interpreted within the distinctive political and cultural context of the movement against drinking and driving.

I hope elaboration of this framework can move social scientists beyond the narrow confines of the underclass debate in two ways: (1) by outlining empirical and theoretical issues that guide further research, and (2) by suggesting variables that have to be taken into account to arrive at a satisfactory explanation of one of the most important domestic problems in the last quarter of the twentieth century--the rise of social dislocations in inner-city ghettos.

Kelly	American Sociological Review	51	3	1986-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 421-429	American Sociological Association	fla		We replicate previous research investigating changes in racial occupational inequality disaggregated by age and level of educational attainment (Hare, 1965; Siegel, 1965; Johnson and Sell, 1976) and then extend this research in four ways. First, we update previous analyses by examining change in inequality between 1970 and 1980. Second, we perform separate analyses by region as well as analyses for the nation as a whole. Third, we investigate race differences in occupational attainment using the Index of Net Difference, a measure of ordinal inequality, as well as the more familiar Index of Dissimilarity (used in previous research), a measure of nominal differentiation. Fourth, we investigate changes in inequality over the period 1940 to 1980 using constant age, education, and occupation categories. Our analyses reveal a number of significant findings including: (a) the Index of Net Difference reveals patterns of change in racial inequality over time that cannot be detected using the Index of Dissimilarity; (b) change in inequality favored whites for the nation as a whole and the non-South during the 1940s, and favored blacks during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, and (c) change in inequality favored whites for the South during the 1940s and 1950s and favored blacks during the 1960s and 1970s.

The results of our analysis suggest: 1) that only two of the organizational and class interests associated with interlocking in previous cross-sectional studies operate in the reconstitution stage--the level of interindustry resource constraint between nonfinancial and financial firms and the membership of firms' directors in the same local capitalist class segment, 2) that the interorganizational linkages and intraclass bonds in which ties may become embedded and which they may facilitate are also important determinants of this stage, and 3) that the interorganizational and intraclass perspectives provide valid and interrelated explanations of interlocking, and thus should be integrated in future studies.

Differences in average years of tenure, total years employed full time, and years out of the labor force since leaving school accounted for almost all of the explained difference. However, over 50 percent of the wage gap remains unexplained.

Yet, a striking feature of policy struggles in the United States between 1974 and 1981 was the dominant influence of a well-organized and unified business lobby. I examine business unity and political influence in the context of recent U.S. policy history. Tracing the legislative histories of the unsuccessful Labor Law Reform and Consumer Protection Agency bills of the 1970s, and the successful Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, a class-based, corporate power structure perspective is supported. The historical conditions fostering the political mobilization and intraclass cohesion of business in the 1970s, and the theoretical implications of the breakdown of business unity after 1981, are also examined.

Beck	American Sociological Review	59	5	1994-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 631-653	American Sociological Association	fla		Despite recent economic gains in much of the Third World, sociologists have paid little attention to the possible national benefits of economic growth. Instead, they have focused on the possible harm caused by the Third World's dependence on foreign investment and trade. Our analysis questions that focus. Based on data for 62 less-developed countries spanning two decades, we find that the effects of dependence largely vanish when (1) the effects of economic growth are carefully specified, and (2) the  semi-difference  models currently in vogue in cross-national research are replaced by more appropriate difference or difference-of-logs (growth-rate) models. In light of the common claim that economic growth in the Third World benefits only the rich, we employ measures of national welfare that the rich cannot readily monopolize. The effects of economic growth on national welfare are large and robust, whereas the effects of dependence are hard to find. These findings contradict earlier studies, which had concluded that the effects of dependence dwarf the effects of economic growth.

Granfors	American Sociological Review	58	4	1993-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 515-535	American Sociological Association	fla		Compared to conventional approaches, we conceptualize transformations in populations of organizations in terms of shifts in their relative embeddedness in markets and states. As organizations expand beyond minimalist conditions of existence, states and markets offer alternative solutions to the core problems of persistence: obtaining resources, managing competition, and constructing legitimacy. By analyzing the movers and stayers in a population of state bar associations that split into two co-existing forms of organization--one primarily reliant on the market and the other primarily dependent on the state--we demonstrate that a two-stage transition to a new form can be explained by the complementary interplay of resource dependency and neo-institutional theories. Organizations are more likely to move from reliance on the market to reliance on the state if (1) their market performance has been unsuccessful, (2) states are willing and able to solve organizational problems, (3) organizations are younger and less established, and (4) compelling alternative models have been propagated by moral entrepreneurs and adopted by influential states.

We find that both welfare states contain stimulative and depressing forms of spending. Transfers in support of household income stimulate growth, while public production of goods and services largely consumed by households depresses growth. Transfers to firms may have a predominantly negative impact on growth, while military spending has a stimulative impact on the economy. We also find that increasing household tax burdens, a correlate of postwar welfare-state expansion, slows economic growth. National debates about economic growth have increasingly been structured as zero-sum choices between the welfare state for households and economic growth. This reasoning neglects the potentially stimulative components of the welfare state for households, and ignores the potentially negative impact of the welfare state for firms.

Sanchez	American Sociological Review	57	6	1992-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 829-842	American Sociological Association	fla		We extend the organizational ecology literature by examining the relationship between organization size and failure. Contrary to the typical monotonically declining relationship between organization size and failure rates found in ecology research, we show that this relationship varies by type of organization. Using data from censuses of Health Maintenance Organizations in the United States, we find that the relationship assumes an inverted U-shape for one type of HMO and a monotonically declining shape for another type of HMO. These relationships result from differences between the two types of HMOs in level of commitment to the organization and to the  liability of the middle.

What happens when a social movement ideology tells constituents one thing, but their experiences tell them something contradictory? I investigate greenbackism in the nineteenth-century labor movement, a striking example of ideology that blatantly contradicted constituents' experiences. I show that, although social movements can account for discrepancies between ideology and experience, such strategies are limited and some collective action frames are ultimately disconfirmed empirically. Collective action frames dealing with practical, everyday issues are similar to falsifiable scientific theories, although the means by which they are disconfirmed is different. Master frames, the larger ideological traditions upon which social movements are based, are comparable to scientific paradigms, which are resistant but not immune to disconfirming evidence.

Gould	American Sociological Review	58	2	1993-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 182-196	American Sociological Association	fla		I develop and analyze a mathematical model describing the relationship between individual contributions to a collective good and the network of social relations that makes these contributions interdependent. Starting from the assumption that actors respond to the contributions of others because of efficacy concerns and norms of fairness, I derive predictions about the impact of network structure on total contributions. Network density and size influence collective action outcomes in dramatically different ways, depending on the structural position of those who make unconditional contributions. Moreover, these effects are highly nonlinear, suggesting that the impact of social ties on collective action may be quite sensitive to mobilization contexts.

Results are consistent with an  underdog  explanation of support among the total sample of workers: support is greatest among those with the fewest organizational and personal resources and rewards, those expressing dissatisfaction with extrinsic rewards, those working in large plants, and union members. The  underdog  explanation is also supported among non-union workers. However, among union workers there is broader and more varied support based primarily on subjective evaluations of work: not only extrinsic dissatisfactions, but also those most supportive of union activities, and those with high perceived job autonomy. These results suggest advocates of worker participation have underestimated the effects of unions and dissatisfaction with extrinsic rewards on fostering worker support for participation.

Feminist scholarship on the state has tended to conceptualize the state as a macro-level structure, embodied in social policies, provisions, and abstract principles. By conceptualizing the state at the institutional level, I widen the scope of feminist state theory to include the micro apparatuses of state power. In my case studies, I depict the dynamics of two institutional gender regimes and the distinct patterns of control and contestation that characterize them. These ethnographic data capture how women's relations to men, children, and welfare programs are constructed and reconstructed by state actors and female clients who regulate and resist each other. From these data I demonstrate that the state is not a uniform structure that acts to impose a singular set of gender expectations on women. Rather, I propose that feminist theorists begin to conceptualize the state as a network of differentiated institutions, layered with conflicting and competing messages about gender.

Peterson	American Sociological Review	52	4	1987-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 511-518	American Sociological Association	fla		Researchers have long been aware of sizable racial differences in the prevalence and timing of premarital sexual behavior. In a national sample of youth aged 15-16, blacks are roughly four times more likely than whites to report ever having intercourse. We consider (1) a demographic composition explanation that stresses differential socioeconomic position; (2) an explanation that focuses on the consequences of low socioeconomic position, a higher incidence of female-headed households, or differences in school performance or educational aspirations; and (3) a contextual explanation based on differences in subgroup attitudes or norms. Results provide limited support for the demographic composition argument and stronger support for a contextual subgroup argument. Blacks in predominately black classrooms are much more likely to report ever having intercourse. We further identify some attitudinal differences between whites, blacks, and blacks in racially homogeneous school settings that could characterize different normative contexts.

Hirsch	American Sociological Review	55	2	1990-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 243-254	American Sociological Association	fla		Recruitment and commitment in protest movements are best explained by analyzing group-level political processes such as consciousness-raising, collective empowerment, polarization, and collective decision-making. Such processes increase protesters' political solidarity--their commitment to the cause and their belief in the non-institutional tactics that further that cause. Other frameworks, such as the rational choice and collective behavior approaches, are less adequate in accounting for recruitment and commitment. Rational choice perspectives neglect group processes by suggesting that decisions about whether to join or stay at a protest are based largely on isolated individual cost/benefit calculations. The collective behavior view that protests are spawned by confused and insecure individuals in situations of social unrest cannot be reconciled with the fact that most protests originate among close-knit groups of politically committed activists using carefully planned strategies and tactics. These conclusions are based on a study of the 1985 Columbia University divestment protest.

Beck	American Sociological Review	57	1	1992-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 103-116	American Sociological Association	fla		We test a model of reciprocal causation between racial violence and black net out-migration from southern counties during the era of the Great Migration. Using county-level data for ten southern states, including a new inventory of southern lynchings, we find support for the model during two decades, 1910-1920 and 1920-1930. Out-migration of blacks was heaviest from counties where more lynchings had occurred and, in turn, counties that witnessed relatively more out-migration of blacks experienced fewer lynchings of blacks. We conclude that mob violence was an important social force driving blacks from certain areas of the South. Southern whites in some communities may also have responded to black out-migration and the loss of cheap labor by improving living conditions for co-resident blacks--by reducing the risk of victimization by white mobs, for example.

These are the first survey network data representative of the American population. The networks are small, kin-centered, relatively dense, and homogeneous in comparison with the sample of respondents. Bivariate examination of subgroup differences by age, education, race/ethnicity, sex, and size of place indicates that network range is greatest among the young, the highly educated, and metropolitan residents. Sex differences consist primarily of differences in kin/nonkin composition of networks.

Skodol	American Sociological Review	51	2	1986-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 242-258	American Sociological Association	fla		Studies of the social mobility of schizophrenic patients have led some to interpret the consistent inverse relationship between socio-economic status (SES) and schizophrenia exlusively in terms of social selection processes. According to this view, the low SES positions held by schizophrenics are less a cause than a consequence of the disorder. Several studies have shown, however, that most of the downward movement, or failure to rise, occurs between the end of schooling and occupation at the time of first admission. Systematic comparisons of the occupational careers of schizophrenic patients by contrast with unaffected controls during this period have not been conducted. This exploratory study shows that, compared to community controls (N = 196) and to persons suffering from major depressive disorder (N = 119), the first full-time occupations of schizophrenic episode patients (N = 60) expose them to noisome work conditions (i.e., hazards, noise, heat, humidity, fumes, and cold) that characterize many blue-collar but few white-collar occupations. Moreover, since our results indicate that this exposure cannot be accounted for by downward mobility, we conclude that class-linked stress may be more important in the etiology of schizophrenia than previous studies of social mobility and schizophrenia have suggested.

This alignment may not always occur, however. I examine the implications of a mismatch between structural opportunities and perceived opportunities using participant and eyewitness accounts of the Iranian revolutionary movement of 1977 through 1979. By several objective measures, the monarchy was not structurally vulnerable. Yet Iranians appear to have perceived opportunities for successful protest, basing their perceptions on a shift in the opposition movement, not on a shift in the structural position of the state. In the conflict between structural conditions and perceived opportunities, the structural conditions gave way. Only by examining cases in which structural opportunities and perceived opportunities are out of balance can the relative effect of each be determined.

Unfortunately, inconsistency, incoherence, and other defects in logic are difficult to detect when a theory is stated in natural language (e.g., English). Translation into a formal logical language makes the theory's structure more explicit, and better accessible for repair. Furthermore, new hypotheses are more easily derived in a logical language. We formalize Hannan and Freeman's theory of organizational inertia in first-order logic. We then examine the logical properties of the formalized theory, provide new theorems about organizational inertia, and discuss the implications of logical formalization for sociological theorizing.

This pattern has emerged despite the socioeconomic disadvantage of Arabs, the small share of resources allocated to Arab education, and government efforts to advance the attainment of Oriental Jews. Two explanations for this pattern are tested and corroborated: First, Arabs benefit from a separate school system, whereas Oriental educational levels are depressed because of competition with more privileged European-origin Jews in an integrated school system. Second, at the secondary level Oriental Jews are tracked disproportionately into vocational tracks which divert them from college education, while in the segregated Arab system secondary education is predominantly college preparatory. The paper concludes by suggesting that tracking, used to separate ethno-cultural groups within a school system and depress their educational attainment, is not  necessary  when the groups are residentially segregated, when more direct means of social exclusion can be employed, and when members of the dominant group are shielded from minority competition in the job market.

Devine	American Sociological Review	50	2	1985-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 150-165	American Sociological Association	fla		The conventional  logic of industrialization  thesis holds that escalations in public expenditures are a response to industrial maturation and attendant sociocultural and demographic transformations, with a neutral state arbitrating differing  needs  via the electoral aggregation of citizen preferences to promote the general welfare. The present research develops an alternative conception of the liberal capitalist state and state expenditure policy. Fiscal policy is portrayed as a highly politicized vehicle by which the state attempts to insure private accumulation, placate and encourage competing classes and factions, and acquiesce to or rebuff demands by mass insurgents-all within the context of a tenuously legitimate electoral system and a fragile social order. A time-series regression analysis of the determinants of social investment and social consumption spending is undertaken for the U.S. over the 1949-77 period. Results suggest that the development perspective is seriously flawed, as fluctuations in these expenditures reflect an inherently politicized budgetary process whereby the complex interplay of a variety of structural economic and partisan political forces are determinant.

Kern	American Sociological Review	61	5	1996-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 900-907	American Sociological Association	fla		Appreciation of fine arts became a mark of high status in the late nineteenth century as part of an attempt to distinguish  highbrowed  Anglo Saxons from the new  lowbrowed  immigrants, whose popular entertainments were said to corrupt morals and thus were to be shunned (Levine 1988; DiMaggio 1991). In recent years, however, many high-status persons are far from being snobs and are eclectic, even  omnivorous,  in their tastes (Peterson and Simkus 1992). This suggests a qualitative shift in the basis for marking elite status--from snobbish exclusion to omnivorous appropriation. Using comparable 1982 and 1992 surveys, we test for this hypothesized change in tastes. We confirm that highbrows are more omnivorous than others and that they have become increasingly omnivorous over time. Regression analyses reveal that increasing  omnivorousness  is due both to cohort replacement and to changes over the 1980s among highbrows of all ages. We speculate that this shift from snob to omnivore relates to status-group politics influenced by changes in social structure, values, art-world dynamics, and generational conflict.

These assumptions govern individuals' choices with respect to each other and are independent of processes associated with fragmentation in various classical literatures. We model  society  as a set of individuals who encounter each other in circumstances that permit potentially productive but also risky relationships with each other. Individuals (1) have the option of playing Prisoner's Dilemma games with others they encounter, but they do not have to; (2) have preferences over mutual cooperation and free-riding outcomes; (3) have expectations about each other's play; (4) have observable category  tags ; (5) can modify their future responses to  tagged  individuals based on experience; (6) can search out partners they believe represent good prospects for productive relationships. In these terms, the only condition necessary for fragmentation to emerge is that some circumstance makes the probability of encounters across  tagged  categories unequal, and a difference in sizes of categories, however slight, is sufficient to do that. Some difference in category sizes is, for practical purposes, inevitable, and thus so are pressures toward fragmentation.

Bielby	American Sociological Review	54	5	1989-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 776-789	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper examines the process by which married men and women form and balance work and family identities. Hypotheses derived from alternative conceptualizations of the commitment process are tested with data from the 1977 Quality of Employment Survey. We find that for both men and women, engagement in work and family roles leads to identification with those roles. However, the process of identity formation differs for men and women in ways that correspond to gender-based differentiation in household and workplace activities. Married women employed outside the home give precedence to family in balancing work and family identities, while married men may have the discretion to build identification with work and family roles without trading one off against the other. Despite differences in the process of commitment formation, our results suggest that when men and women engaged in similar work and family roles they are almost equally committed to those roles.

I apply an interest-based theory to the rise of Italian fascism using data from the first systematic analysis of Fascist electoral strength in the critical 1921 Italian national legislative election. Results support the hypotheses that the growth of the Fascist vote came at the expense of the Socialists and that much of the support for Italian fascism can be attributed to voters' rational calculations of their material interests.

Jargowsky	American Sociological Review	61	6	1996-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 984-998	American Sociological Association	fla		Compared to residential segregation by race, economic segregation has received relatively little attention in recent empirical literature. Yet a heated debate has arisen concerning Wilson's (1987) hypothesis that increasing economic segregation among African Americans plays a role in the formation of urban ghettos. I present a methodological critique of the measure of economic segregation used by Massey and Eggers (1990) and argue that their measure confounds changes in the income distribution with spatial changes. I develop a  pure  measure of economic segregation based on the correlation ratio and present findings for all U.S. metropolitan areas from 1970 to 1990. Economic segregation increased steadily for Whites, Blacks, and Hispanics in the 1970s and 1980s, but the increases have been particularly large and widespread for Blacks and Hispanics in the 1980s. I explore the causes of these changes in a reduced-form, fixed-effects model. Social distance and structural economic transformations affect economic segregation, but the large increases in economic segregation among minorities in the 1980s cannot be explained by the model. These rapid increases in economic segregation, especially in the context of recent, albeit small, declines in racial segregation, have important implications for urban policy, poverty policy, and the stability of urban communities.

Ironically, it was precisely when the New Federalism was culminated during the Reagan Administration that many states experienced record rates of business failure. I extend Gordon, Edwards, and Reich's (1982) historical model of social structures of accumulation to analyze state differences in business failure rates between 1970 and 1985. I hypothesize that the threats to business survival posed by working-class power and welfare provisions were neutralized under the New Federalism, but that, nonetheless, corporate survival became more precarious because the New Federalism created local fiscal crises and promoted ineffective state economic development policies. Results from a pooled, time-series analysis basically corroborate these hypotheses.

Kelley	American Sociological Review	55	2	1990-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 191-208	American Sociological Association	fla		The introduction of programmable machines into blue-collar machining occupations affords an opportunity to study the conditions under which occupational skill upgrading occurs with technological change. How do workplaces that permit blue-collar occupations to take on programming responsibilities differ from those that do not? This paper presents a contingency model explaining how this choice of job design is mediated by four types of factors: techno-economic forces, internal labor market structures, institutional mechanisms for governing the labor-management relationship, and the organizational context. The data are from a 1986-87 national survey of production managers in a size-stratified random sample of manufacturing establishments in 21 industries. A multivariate logistic regression analysis reveals that the technology and product market alone do not determine job design. The least complex organizations (small plant, small firm) tend to offer the greatest opportunities for skill upgrading, independent of techno-economic conditions--a finding at variance with current labor market segmentation theory.

Contradictory reports in the literature concerning the superior or inferior earnings of the self-employed relative to wage/salaried workers are related to the choice of functional form of the earnings equation. Based on samples of four entrepreneurial immigrants plus control samples of Blacks and Whites from the 1980 Public Use Microdata Sample, we find large differences in the net effect of self-employment, depending on the use of a linear (absolute dollar values) or loglinear (relative returns) form. We examine various explanations for the discrepancy and identify the role of outliers as significant. The loglinear form fits the data better, but at the cost of obliterating substantively important information, namely the preponderance of the self-employed among positive outliers. Effects of excluding the latter from the linear form and the theoretical and policy implications of alternative specifications of the earnings equation are examined.

Two agrarian societies, France and the Ottoman empire, confronted similar socioeconomic problems in the seventeenth-century. During the seventeenth century, numerous and serious peasant revolts occurred in France, where the provincial social structure fostered unity among classes. In addition state policy in France was geared toward long-term control of the periphery. This antagonized nearly every provincial group and made it possible for peasants to ally with an equally disgruntled nobility to successfully stage rebellious movements. In the Ottoman Empire, the provincial structure promoted disunity, and state policy was short-term and created competition within provincial classes. The peasants there could not find allies and therefore did not engage in collective action.

For both Jewish groups number of siblings has a negative effect on educational attainment. However, this pattern is not replicated for Moslems whose social organization is based largely on the extended family and the patrilineage (the hamula). Among Moslems the extended family plays an active supporting role vis-à-vis the nuclear family. While the size of the nuclear family does not affect educational attainment for Moslems in Israel, the size of the hamula does. This suggests that when the nuclear family draws on the support of an extended kinship, its size is less important for the educational attainment of children.

Although prominent in early ethnomethodological work, the recognition that all renderings of reality--including those of the social scientist--are contingent accomplishments has diminished in contemporary studies. I describe the emergence and fall of radical reflexivity within ethnomethodology, the processes contributing to its diminishing role, and the implications of the decline. Because radical reflexivity breaches the taken-for-granted practices of disciplines purporting to describe reality, it is a vital resource for ethnomethodology and sociology generally.

Bachman	American Sociological Review	53	1	1988-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 81-93	American Sociological Association	fla		Because a wide variety of deviant behaviors are positively correlated with one another, some researchers conclude that all are manifestations of a single general tendency. The present analysis incorporated three waves of self-reports about heavy alcohol use, marijuana use, use of other illicit drugs, dangerous driving, and other criminal behavior for a nationally representative sample of high school seniors. A relatively stable general involvement in deviance accounted for virtually all association between different types of deviance, but the stability of each behavior could only be explained by equally important and stable specific influences. Thus, theories that treat different deviant behaviors as alternative manifestations of a single general tendency can account for some, but far from all, of the meaningful variance in these behaviors. The only significant influence of one type of deviance on another was that of marijuana use on later use of other illicit drugs. The causal model also revealed interpretable shifts in the associations among these behaviors over the four years following high school.

Appold	American Sociological Review	58	2	1993-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 283-301	American Sociological Association	fla		Various forms of participation in the global system have been hypothesized to distort the structure of industrialization in developing countries, influencing the relations between industrial capital, labor, and output. We operationalize Kuznets's (1965) theoretical definition of industrialization utilizing energy consumption per capita, percent of the labor force employed in industry, and percent of GDP accounted for by industry, to test several predictions about the effects of a country's involvement in the global system on the structure of its industrialization. We first estimate a measurement model for 1970 that includes these three basic indicators as influenced by the latent variable of industrialization. Elaborations of the basic model allow us to measure the influence of the world system on the structure of industrialization. Types of goods imported and exported affect the structure of industrialization; position in the world system and direct foreign investment have no net direct effects. A Marxist-Leninist regime has an independent influence on the structure of industrialization in some years. We replicate the model using data from 1965, 1980, and 1986.

Denis O'Hearn	American Sociological Review	54	4	1989-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 578-596	American Sociological Association	fla		The dependency approach has recently been criticized by authors who quote the  exceptional  East Asian cases. The Irish case is used to refute these new modernizationist arguments on two counts. (1) Countries such as Ireland, not the East Asian countries, have regimes with characteristics that tend to set dependency relations in motion. These characteristics include radical free trade, free enterprise, and foreign industrial domination. (2) Because of these characteristics, Ireland has endured economic stagnation and tendencies toward higher inequality. Irish economic growth under foreign-dominated industrialization was slowed by decapitalization and by the absence of linkages between foreign and domestic industry. Time-series models show that foreign penetration and free trade are related to slower economic growth, because of slower investment-growth and other reasons. Inequality increased primarily because of rising unemployment. Although social welfare programs reduced the effects of direct-income inequality, their effects have been reduced by regressive taxation and austerity programs.

Uchida	American Sociological Review	53	1	1988-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 94-102	American Sociological Association	fla		Using Donald Black's theory of self-help, and drawing on the collective security model and the  fear and loathing  hypothesis, this paper examines factors influencing defensive weapon ownership. Interview data from 9,021 randomly selected households in 59 residential neighborhoods are used to assess the association between household and neighborhood characteristics and decisions to purchase weapons for self-protection. Findings indicate that defensive weapon ownership varies inversely with other forms of social control, such as the perceived effectiveness of police. Additionally, purchases of defensive weapons are associated with household demographics, past victimization, and perceived risk of crime. Collectively, these results indicate that self-help (defensive weapon ownership) is a structured form of social action.

Baum, Christine Oliver	American Sociological Review	57	4	1992-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 540-559	American Sociological Association	fla		Population density--the number of organizations of a particular type--has been used to study the effects of legitimation and conception on rates of organizational founding and failure. We investigate the influence of population density and relational density--the number of ties between organizations and their institutional environment--on founding and failure rates in a population of day care centers. Findings suggest that embeddedness in the institutional environment underlies the legitimating effects of initial population growth and the improved survival capabilities of a population of organizations in the long run.

This question is approached using a micro-based simulation that explains macro-outcomes and can handle the macro-level's ensuing effects on micro-decisions. In this way, the analysis is also an argument for a viable reductionism in the micro/macro debate. The Hobbesian problem is simulated by an artificial world of boundedly rational, innovative individuals playing a multitude of Iterated Prisoner's Dilemmas. Over time, individuals change their strategies to optimize against everyone else's choices. This simple dynamic approach reveals a surprising efficiency: Even with substantial amounts of misunderstanding, cooperation can emerge and be sustained. Moreover, the level of cooperation is high--generally much better than would be obtained using TIT FOR TAT. The uncoerced cooperation that evolves is stable because it is composed of many different strategies--some nice (in the nucleus) and some more cautious (in a protective shield)--making it difficult for any contender to beat everyone. Such a dynamic model provides a powerful metaphor for a pluralistic society.

Steffensmeier	American Sociological Review	54	1	1989-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 107-123	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper examines the relationship between employment conditions and property-crime arrest rates of male juveniles and young adults, using age-specific state-level data from 1977-1980, compiled from raw arrest data of the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports and from the Census Bureau's annual March Current Population Survey. The analysis is disaggregated by age and utilizes dimensions of underemployment to provide more sensitive indicators for labor market conditions, including measures of job availability (such as unemployment) and job quality (such as low hours and low wages). Controls are included for criminal opportunity and other variables related to crime and the labor market. Labor market effects on arrest rates differ for juveniles and young adults. Availability of employment produces strong effects on juvenile arrest rates--full-time employment is associated with low arrest rates, unemployment with high arrest rates. Low quality of employment (e.g., inadequate pay and hours) is associated with high arrest rates for young adults. We discuss theoretical and policy implications of our findings.

Feinberg	American Sociological Review	50	4	1985-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 561-571	American Sociological Association	fla		This study uses simple mathematical models to assess the effects of affirmative action and economic growth as  strategies  for achieving racial equality. The models focus on occupations as they are locally situated, and equality is considered  achieved  when the racial composition of the group of incumbents in the occupation matches the racial composition of the local labor force. The speed with which equality is achieved is examined in four contrasting situations; the situations combine either high or low proportion black in the local labor force with high or low vacancy rate for the occupation. The strategies are not equally effective in speeding the achievement of equality, nor is one overall strategy more effective than the other in all the contrasting situations. Moreover, the growth strategy, though often less effective than affirmative action in speeding equality, can have the compensating benefit of establishing more jobs that are available to the disadvantaged. This apparent conflict suggests the need for deciding which alternative, achieving equality or providing jobs for the disadvantaged, is the primary goal if there is to be some uniform policy for eradicating the current and future consequences of past racial discrimination.

It focuses on the implications of world economy and world polity perspectives. Results indicate the usefulness of both perspectives, while also pointing to an array of other factors. On the world economy side, the rate of decolonization rose during the period of American hegemony. On the world polity side, decolonization was more rapid where suffrage regimes were broad and after 1960 when imperialism was delegitimated in global political discourse. There is further evidence of diffusion processes within empires, where the number of prior decolonization events within the empire accelerated the decolonization rate of remaining dependencies. Separate analyses of decolonization before and after World War II point to some shifts in parameters over time that challenge assumptions that institutional effects are invariably located in the later stages of a historical process.

Guterbock	American Sociological Review	57	2	1992-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 266-273	American Sociological Association	fla		We examine the structure of sociology using data on overlapping memberships in the discipline's  visible colleges,  the specialty sections of the American Sociological Association. Hypotheses about the structure of joint specialization in sociology are derived from four general theories of professional and scientific specialization: ideational theory, political-economic theory, professional power theory, and intellectual circle/network theory. We analyze joint specialty section memberships using multidimensional scaling techniques and produce a spatial model of the discipline's specialty structure. The tightest clusters of specialties arise from the confluence of ideational aspects (like shared concepts or subject matter), professional power interests, and social characteristics of members. Although a major division in the discipline is embedded in the political-economic environment of sociology, three cross-cutting dimensions are required to adequately represent the discipline's structure. The main dimensions of differentiation are: (1)  conflict  versus  applied  perspectives, (2) micro versus macro units of analysis, and (3) ascriptive characteristics of members. These three dimensions support the validity of political-economic, ideational, and professional power theories, respectively.

Meyer, David Miyahara	American Sociological Review	60	3	1995-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 360-377	American Sociological Association	fla		Contemporary societies are organized around models in which both collective and individual goods, resources, and other properties are central. These models are highly developed and rationalized so that scientific and cultural scrutiny of their core elements are highly legitimated. In almost all of these models, the individual is such a core element--as an ultimate sovereign, beneficiary, and as a component of the collective. This produces social arrangements in which scientized and professionalized attention to the inner structure and behavior of the individual receives much public attention. Using multiple indicator models, we show that those modern polities strongly centered on the individual as a core component create higher levels of professionalized psychology than do other polities, even when general social and economic resources and complexity (and some other controls) are held constant.

Griffin	American Sociological Review	54	6	1989-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 873-890	American Sociological Association	fla		Most time-ordered analyses of historical processes are rendered  ahistorical  because the premises that direct quantitative inquiry obscure changing historical relations through time. These conventional practices stem from three problematic presuppositions: (1) the separation of theory and history, (2) ahistorical conceptions of time, and (3) methodological autonomy and the primacy of the theory of statistical technique. We illustrate how these premises shape sociological-historical investigation by examining several quantitative historical analyses of labor organization and conflict. Reanalysis of the same historical series with  temporally moving covariance  analysis demonstrates theoretically important historical contingency as well as the error of presupposing temporal homogeneity in historical relationships. Our critique of conventional practice and our reanalysis enable us to pose alternative premises to ground quantitative historical research in the interdependence of history and theory, in historical conceptions of time, and in the historicization of quantitative methodology. Our redirection aims at moving us closer to historical  actuality,  that is, to historical relations and processes, when we use time-series data and analytic procedures.

The question of which dominates the coalition reflects current debates about the structure of power in capitalist society. This paper addresses these debates through the detailed study of a growth coalition in a rural industrialization project in southern Japan. It traces the strategies and modes of influence of the six actors, their structure and process, through the 25-year history of the project. Contrary to the  strong state  image of Japan, national big business dominated the growth coalition. The rest of the society, including the state, adjusted around its motion. This resulted in policies which favored economic growth over social needs, giving some of the other actors legitimation problems. Yet, success at rapid growth prevented these from assuming crisis proportions. The findings run counter to state autonomy arguments and suggest closer attention be paid to multiple levels of structure and process.

This paper illustrates that institutions, in this case professionalism, may also affect variation of structural forms within a niche. Using a case study of the funeral industry, important effects of the institutional environment on variation are identified. The study contributes to the ecological perspective by showing that, in some cases, the selection game is fixed because variation is not random.

Ford	American Sociological Review	51	1	1986-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 47-61	American Sociological Association	fla		Research demonstrates that sex or gender remains a powerful basis of inequality in the expectations and behavior of men and women in mixed-sex task groups. Drawing upon the work of Epstein (1970) and the theoretical apparatus of status characteristics theory (see Berger et al., 1977), we explore one means by which these inequalities may be reduced--the disconfirmation of established gender-based expectations. The results of two experiments--one involving females and one involving males--show that disconfirmation does in fact reduce tasks inequality for both women and men. The results also support predictions based on the combining and attenuation principles of status characteristics theory. We interpret these findings as demonstrating that sex role socialization is (1) a manifestation of a more general status organizing process and (2) more situationally specific than has previously been assumed.

Randall Collins	American Sociological Review	54	1	1989-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 124-139	American Sociological Association	fla		Criticisms of the scientific status of sociology possess some validity when applied against narrowly positivist interpretations of sociological methods and metatheory, but do not undermine the scientific project of formulating generalized explanatory models. (1) Critics allege that sociology has made no lawful findings; but valid general principles exist in many areas. (2) Situational interpretation, subjectivity, reflexivity, and emergence are alleged to undermine explanatory sociology, but these topics themselves can be explained by a widened conception of science that allows informal procedures in theorizing aimed at maximizing explanatory coherence. (3) The fact that intellectual discourse itself is a historically changeable social product does not invalidate objective explanatory knowledge. (4) The historicist claim that there can be no principles that hold across particular times and places is invalid and rests upon a confusion of underlying generative principles with the complexities of the empirical surface of history. (5) Metatheoretical criticism of the concept of causality does not undermine a sophisticated conception of scientific sociology. Sociological knowledge can and does advance, but it depends upon building the coherence of theoretical conceptions across different areas and methods of research.

Waite, Frances Kobrin Goldscheider, Christina Witsberger	American Sociological Review	51	4	1986-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 541-554	American Sociological Association	fla		Young adults in recent cohorts have been leaving the parental home earlier and marrying later now than they did several decades ago, resulting in an increased period of independent living. This paper explores the consequences of time spent in non-family living, using data from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Young Men and Young Women. We expect that experience in living away from home prior to marriage will cause young adults to change their attitudes, values, plans, and expectations, and move them away from a traditional family orientation. We find strong support for this hypothesis for young women; those who lived independently became more likely to plan for employment, lowered their expected family size, became more accepting of employment of mothers, and more non-traditional on sex roles in the family than those who lived with their parents. Non-family living had much weaker effects on young men in the few tests that we could perform for them. The paper also addresses the conditions under which living away increases individualism, and it discusses the implications of these findings.

In this study, I illuminate weaknesses in the received view of regional processes, and I demonstrate the value of bringing the state into analyses of regional transformation. Case studies of the steel industry, airframe manufacturers, and military installations contrast pre- and postwar trends to determine if the state's World War II investments transformed regional processes or if wartime investments merely reinforced processes that were already underway. For the steel industry, the civilian-oriented and economistic reasoning of the received view of regional processes is most persuasive. In contrast, the state's wartime logistic and strategic priorities molded the dramatic expansion of U.S. military bases during the war--growth machine politics played an important secondary role. The airframe industry offers the most interesting case--the economic influences on this industry intersected with both military and political factors. Thus, this study provides evidence that regional processes are molded by the overlapping, and at times competing, needs for use of space by economic, political, and military actors. The immediate lesson is that it is important to bring the study of war-making into the sociological mainstream.

Shapiro	American Sociological Review	55	3	1990-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 346-365	American Sociological Association	fla		The concept of white-collar crime, part of the sociological vocabulary for half a century, rests on a spurious correlation between role-specific norms and the characteristics of the occupants of these roles. In this paper, I strive to  liberate  the concept of white-collar crime by disentangling the identification of the perpetrators with their misdeeds. I suggest that white-collar criminals violate norms of trust, enabling them to rob without violence and burgle without trespass. I develop a conception of trust, expose the strategies by which wayward trustees establish and exploit trust, and demonstrate how the social organization of trust abuse confounds traditional systems of social control. Drawing on research on securities fraud, I debunk commonly-held understandings about the role of class bias in the legal system by showing that the leniency accorded white-collar criminals is due to the social organization of their misdeeds and the policing and punishment problems their crimes pose, rather than to their status.

Chriss	American Sociological Review	60	4	1995-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 545-565	American Sociological Association	fla		In his Theory of Communicative Action, Habermas (1984, 1987) argues that because Goffman's dramaturgy emphasizes the goal-oriented or strategic nature of actors' self-presentations, it fails to establish the conditions for noncoerced or reasoned communication. After reviewing Habermas's negative reading of Goffman, I assess both Habermas's and Goffman's theories in the context of professional practice and organizational behavior. I suggest that certain programs in the social psychology of organizations, such as Argyris and Schon's (1974) action research, share Habermas's one-sided view of Goffman's actor as an opportunistic, insincere manipulator. This misreading of Goffman results from a fundamental confusion over the ontology and epistemology of  impression management.  I conclude that if Habermas's theory of communicative action is to advance further, that is, if it is ever to adequately link with the empirical social world, it must come to more concrete terms with the nature of the presented self.

Crenshaw	American Sociological Review	60	5	1995-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 702-718	American Sociological Association	fla		Macrosocial theories of democratization point to the pluralism attendant on industrialization, class conflicts and alliances, the state and its social environment, and transnational linkages as influential in the growth of political and civil rights. Unfortunately, these theories neglect the ecological and technological histories of many contemporary states. Proto-modernity, defined as a rich demographic and institutional inheritance rooted in the preindustrial past, is theorized to lay the foundations of pluralism and class structure, in essence allowing some states to democratize more easily than others. In this longitudinal, cross-national analysis using data from a maximum of 83 countries, I find robust support for the importance of modernity and proto-modernity to the growth of democracy. By contrast, results are inconclusive on whether stratification affects democratization.

Schervish	American Sociological Review	51	5	1986-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 717-733	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper extends the utility of log-linear analysis by presenting a new way to interpret its parameters. We focus on explaining and trying to solve the interpretational problems arising from the difficulty of distinguishing between absolute and relative comparisons that are embedded in a set of log-linear parameters as well as in odds ratios constructed from the parameters. As a solution, we propose a technique for calculating adjusted crosstabulations from log-linear results. Our solution provides a more intuitive and comprehensible method for presenting and discussing results, especially for resolving the issue of absolute versus relative comparisons. As an illustration, we analyze a data set on unemployment, using polytomous dependent and independent variables. We utilize these results to highlight some of the problems of common odds-ratio interpretations of parameters and to describe in detail the application and interpretation of the method of constructing adjusted crosstabulations.

The analysis reveals that roughly half of the members of these families contributed little or nothing to this presidential campaign, but other family members were often major contributors. Family members who were most visible as corporate directors or foundation trustees or who were listed in Who's Who in America contributed the most to this campaign. In addition, wealthy entrepreneurs contributed more to the campaign than members of subsequent generations of wealthy capitalist families. Members of wealthy Jewish and Southern families contributed slightly more to the Republican party than the Democratic party, but they contributed much more to the Democratic party than did the members of other wealthy capitalist families. In addition, the members of families that were major stockholders in oil companies or companies with large government contacts contributed more to the campaign than did the members of other wealthy capitalist families. Conversely, the members of families that were major stockholders in media companies contributed relatively little to this campaign.

Wimberley	American Sociological Review	55	1	1990-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 75-91	American Sociological Association	fla		Dependency perspectives contend that foreign investment promotes underdevelopment in the Third World, whereas diffusionist perspectives argue that it promotes development. Earlier cross-national research conceptualized development as economic growth or inequality. This study conceptualizes development as basic needs satisfaction, focusing on infant mortality and life expectancy at one year of age. Mortality effects of 1967 multinational corporate penetration and foreign aid dependence are assessed for 63 underdeveloped countries in panel models extending to 1980. Other variables affecting mortality include multinational corporate investment flows, secondary school enrollment, and changes in birth rates and government health spending. Aid dependence has no effects. Multinational corporate penetration has significant harmful effects on mortality that tend to increase with time. In addition to harmful effects on infant mortality, penetration has small benefits for infant mortality via promotion of health spending. The influence of multinational corporate penetration on mortality appears to be mediated in part by inequality.

We reconceptualize age and family formation as interacting causes of religious participation rather than competing explanations of it. We expand the concept of family formation to include divorce, cohabitation, and dissolution of cohabitational relationships. We distinguish attitudes toward the family from family formation behavior. We analyze data from the National Longitudinal Study of the High School Class of 1972, which traces church membership to age 32. Our results show that the effect of children on church membership varies with the combination of the children's and parent's ages. We find separate effects of family formation behavior and attitudes toward the family. Cohabitation, divorce, and dissolution of cohabitational unions all affect membership probability, but these effects vary with age and are often different for men and women.

This is particularly true of the firm, which has remained a black box in conventional analyses of state socialism. On the basis of case studies of two comparable firms, one in the United States and one in Hungary, we criticize eight stereotypes that underly the presumption that state socialist firms are necessarily less efficient than capitalist firms. We then propose conditions under which capitalist firms may be less technically efficient than state socialist firms.

Granfors	American Sociological Review	52	4	1987-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 456-471	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper uses national data on the growth of state bar associations to develop organizational theory in three respects. First it refines the theory of organizational vital events through a distinction between minimalist and nonminimalist organizations. Second, it develops conceptually and empirically the interplay of time (age, cohort, and period) and size in explanations of the founding and failure of associations. Third, it tests various population and economic theories of vital events in the national population of state bar associations from 1870-1920. We find that minimalist organizations differ systematically from most organizations in the literature by (1) having distinctive rates of failure but not of founding, (2) displaying a liability of newness for the population of associations, but none for individual associations, and (3) having a liability of smallness but not a liability of newness for individual associations. We obtain significant results for environmental models of founding and for time and size models of failure. The empirical analysis suggests the heuristic value of discriminating between minimalist and other organizations in population and resource theories of organizations.

The results indicate that variations in metropolitan area segregation are strongly related to local distributions of occupations (which we view as  structural propensities  to segregate). Net of structural propensities and of considerable explanatory importance, however, are a number of indicators of population size, economic vitality, and women's competitiveness. The paper concludes by viewing organizations within metropolitan area environments, and urges that variables pertaining to metropolitan areas and to organizations be combined into a single model.

Tolnay	American Sociological Review	55	4	1990-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 526-539	American Sociological Association	fla		We reconsider the relationship between economic conditions and the lynching of blacks in the Deep South from 1882 to 1930 using time series analysis. Net of other factors, lynchings were more frequent in years when the  constant dollar  price of cotton was declining and inflationary pressure was increasing. Relative size of the black population was also positively related to lynching. We conclude that mob violence against southern blacks responded to economic conditions affecting the financial fortunes of southern whites--especially marginal white farmers. These effects were significantly more important in the decades before 1900, possibly because of the declining importance of agriculture, the  Jim Crow  disenfranchisement of blacks, and the increasing out-migration of blacks and whites from the Deep South.

Zehr	American Sociological Review	50	3	1985-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 392-409	American Sociological Association	fla		The boundary between science and religion has long been a site for cultural and professional conflict. We examine the testimony of scientists at the Scopes  Monkey Trial  in 1925 and at the McLean  Creation-Science  trial in 1981-82. The two trials were public occasions for scientists to present ideologies of science that legitimated their professional claims to cognitive authority, public financing and control over part of the public school curriculum. The rhetoric of scientists at each trial was directed toward a separate professional goal: at Scopes, scientists differentiated scientific knowledge from religious belief in a way that presented them as distinctively useful but complementary; at McLean, the boundary between science and religion was drawn to exclude creation scientists from the profession. Both goals-(1) differentiation of a valued commodity uniquely provided by science, and (2) exclusion of pseudoscientists-are important for scientists' establishment of a professional monopoly over the market for knowledge about nature. Each goal, however, required different descriptions of  science  at the two trials, and we conclude that this ideological flexibility has contributed to the successful professionalization of scientists in American society.

Hannan, Klaus Schömann, Hans-Peter Blossfeld	American Sociological Review	55	5	1990-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 694-713	American Sociological Association	fla		Research on wage differentials for men and women and for labor market sectors has relied largely on cross-sectional analysis. Using data on three cohorts of West German men and women, we bring a dynamic perspective to these issues by analyzing wage changes for three aspects of work histories: (1) wage rate at time of first entry into the labor market, (2) wage changes when workers change jobs, and (3) wage growth within jobs. Education affects first wages for men and women, but the effect weakens sharply over time. Education also has a significant positive impact on wage growth within jobs over the entire period for men and a positive, but not significant, effect for women. Highly educated women do less well than other women when changing jobs, consistent with the view that advancement for such women is impeded by a  glass ceiling.  Labor market segment affects initial wages and wage gains due to a job change. However, movement into internal labor markets (skilled jobs in large firms) does not confer an initial payoff in wages. Workers in sectors characterized by internal labor markets do not experience higher than average wage growth within jobs, a result that runs counter to theories of segmented labor markets. Finally, wages grow at a decreasing rate with duration of job for both men and women. However, wage growth is initially more rapid for women but also declines more sharply over time.

Burton	American Sociological Review	54	1	1989-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 17-32	American Sociological Association	fla		Stable democratic regimes depend heavily on the  consensual unity  of national elites. So long as elites remain disunified, political regimes are unstable, a condition which makes democratic transitions and democratic breakdowns merely temporary oscillations in the forms unstable regimes take. Disunity appears to be the generic condition of national elites, and disunity strongly tends to persist regardless of socioeconomic development and other changes in mass populations. The consensually unified elites that are necessary to stable democracies are created in only a few ways, two of the most important of which involve distinctive elite transformations. After elaborating this argument, we examine the relationship between elites and regimes in Western nation-states since they began to consolidate after 1500. We show that our approach makes good sense of the Western political record, that it does much to clarify prospects for stable democracies in developing societies today, and that it makes the increasingly elite-centered analysis of democratic transitions and breakdowns more systematic.

Mueller	American Sociological Review	54	4	1989-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 622-634	American Sociological Association	fla		We investigate change in occupational earnings during the 1970s by comparing similar models at either end of the decade. Since the 1970s were years of relative economic stagnation, we anticipated that they would not be favorable to women. To suggest hypotheses we related ideas regarding workers' status characteristics, human capital, market demand, and job content, the last compatible with the comparable worth tradition. Expectedly, economic stagnation affected women more unfavorably than men. Although earnings attainment generally appeared less dependent on workers' status characteristics in 1980 than in 1970, incomes increased less for occupations where concentrations of women were high. Earnings returns to human capital increased during the interval, largely owing to stronger returns among males. In addition, female earnings were more sensitive than male earnings to workers' status characteristics. We note directions for future research using these indicators in contextual models.

Grobe, Daniel Sheehan, Yuan Shuan	American Sociological Review	55	1	1990-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 127-142	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper tests a cultural resources/social interaction model of gatekeeping by school teachers using data for seventh- and eighth-grade students in a city school district. Where previous investigations of  cultural capital  have focused on the rewards accruing to highbrow music and arts activities, we examine the informal academic standards by which teachers reward more general skills, habits, and styles. The result is a recursive causal model including the following blocks of variables: (a) student and teacher background characteristics, (b) student basic skills, absenteeism, and teacher judgments of student work habits, disruptiveness, and appearance; (c) coursework mastery; and (d) course grades. This model fits the data quite well, and almost completely accounts for the course-grade differentials observed for gender, ethnicity, and poverty groups. The most important predictor variable is the teacher's judgment of student work habits, followed by cognitive performance on both basic skills and coursework mastery. The results suggest that the standard (Wisconsin) status attainment model be modified to include cultural/social-interactional-based measures of individual and gatekeeper behaviors and perceptions.

Along with three other theoretical conditions, the debate provided an unusual opportunity to develop and assess important implications of Mannheim's theory of generational effects. National data gathered before the war and during the war indicate that generational experience had a significant effect on which analogy was chosen as more relevant and that the analogy chosen had, in turn, a strong relation to support for or opposition to the war. However, the translation of generational experience into final support for or opposition to the war was weak. Reasons for the weak relationship are discussed.

I present a sociological concept of  mode of exchange  as an alternative and distinguish four modes of exchange based on whether trade is open to popular participation and whether trade is primarily within a region or across regions. The social structural conditions that underlie each mode of exchange include the level of stratification and political centralization. The power struggle among groups for control over trade, rather than individual utility maximization, is a critical factor in commercial development. I apply this framework to commercial development of England and Japan.

However, few attempts have been made to examine the actual structure of this common speech activity. We recorded and analyzed 16 gossip episodes that occurred in adolescent conversations in a middle school setting. We used a combination of ETHNO and sociolinguistic analysis to examine the overall ordering of acts in the gossip episodes. Our findings reveal a gossip structure among adolescents that promotes the expression of negative evaluations--there are many opportunities to express support and limited opportunities to challenge a negative evaluation. We also find that gossip has a flexible structure but that the ordering of acts is critical. In particular, the first response to an initial evaluation strongly influenced subsequent responses. These findings highlight the importance of examining how evaluations develop in gossip and encourages a broader approach to the study of power in discourse which includes the power inherent in responses.

Scott Long	American Sociological Review	55	4	1990-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 469-478	American Sociological Association	fla		Productive scientists tend to hold jobs at prestigious university departments, but it is unclear whether this is because good departments hire the best scientists or because good departments encourage and facilitate research productivity. To resolve this issue, we studied the antecedents and consequences of 179 job changes by chemists, biologists, physicists, and mathematicians. Those who were upwardly mobile showed substantial increases in their rate of publication and in the rate of citation to those publications, while those who were downwardly mobile showed substantial decreases in productivity. Earlier analyses of these job changes found only a small effect of prior productivity on destination prestige. These results suggest that the effect of department affiliation on productivity is more important than the effect of productivity on departmental affiliation.

Guest, Rodney Stark	American Sociological Review	61	2	1996-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 203-218	American Sociological Association	fla		Recent theoretical arguments contend that when the state permits a religious free market, pluralism and competition will emerge and overall levels of religious participation will increase. We return to nineteenth-century America, when the emergence of a religious free market was in progress, to examine whether pluralism generated higher levels of religious participation. We use data from the New York State censuses of 1855 and 1865 to explore religious participation in 942 towns and cities in the state. Our results strongly support the pluralism thesis, highlight demographic effects on religious participation, and help explain conflicting research findings on pluralism and religious participation.

Statistically, the paper describes a new way of representing causal chains, which is less complex, and more easily comprehended and communicated. Conceptually, it proposes a focus on life chances, defined as the probability distribution over hierarchical outcomes. Life chances order a population or cohort from most advantaged to least. For each life cycle stage there is a distinct rank. The transitions between stages reshuffle ranks. The correlation of successive rankings measures mobility/immobility, which was not directly assessed in the classical treatment. The  life chances perspective  recasts the original data as a sequence of correlations describing the degree of change in social rank. This leads to a substantive reinterpretation, that mobility is much less prevalent than it previously appeared.

Several major theories--micromobilization theory, value expectancy, and bandwagon (critical mass) models--are used to sort out the empirical relationships between protest behavior (violent and nonviolent), strikes, spatial diffusion, concessions, and repression in the year prior to the Shah's exit from Iran. Estimates from Poisson regression models show that repression had a short-term negative effect and a long-term positive effect on overall levels of protest via repression's influence on spatial diffusion. I infer that this pattern of effects stems from a combination of deterrent and micromobilization mechanisms. Concessions expanded the protests by accelerating massive urban strikes that in turn generated more opposition activity throughout Iran. Spatial diffusion was encouraged by government concessions and massive labor strikes. Mutually reinforcing relationships between concessions, strikes, and spatial diffusion indicate the significance of intergroup dynamics in the revolutionary process.

The resource control perspective is used to develop two measures of control over organizational resources: control over monetary resources and control over personnel. Among men, control over monetary resources is a stronger determinant of earnings than other work-related variables. Among women, control over monetary resources and control over personnel are jointly stronger determinants of earnings than other work-related variables. The implications of resource control for investigations of earnings within classes are briefly discussed.

This study, based on data on the education, social backgrounds, and careers of 2,729 senior managers associated with 208 major corporations, analyzes the relationship between stratification within higher education (as measured by institutional status and level of credential) and stratification within the ranks of top corporate management. Findings reveal that: (1) Corporate ascent is facilitated by the possession of a bachelor's degree from a top-ranked college, a master's degree in business administration from a prominent program, or a degree in law from a leading institution. (2) Controlling for educational credentials, an upper-class background increases the likelihood of rising to the top ranks of corporate management. (3) The impact of a law degree and an upper-class origin are most pronounced for successful movement beyond the firm into formal and informal inter-corporate networks.

Miller McPherson, Thomas Rotolo	American Sociological Review	61	2	1996-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 179-202	American Sociological Association	fla		We test a dynamic model of the social composition of voluntary groups. The model is based on the idea that sociodemographic variables define social niches in which voluntary groups grow and decline, share and compete, and change or remain static. The flow of individuals through such groups depends on the competition of other groups for their time and other resources. We build a dynamic model of this process and show how this model can account for changes in the social composition and the social heterogeneity of voluntary groups. We use life history data on the group affiliations of 1,050 individuals from 1974 to 1989 to test hypotheses about the diversity of education among group members and about the mean level of education of the members. Our data strongly support the hypotheses.

Rubin	American Sociological Review	51	2	1986-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 147-167	American Sociological Association	fla		Studies of class struggle and formation are seldom tied systematically to the social movement and collective action literature. We attempt in this paper to apply some of the concepts developed first in the collective action literature to the successful efforts of U.S. capital to hinder the organizing efforts of trade unions in the years before the New Deal. Specifically, we identify the interests of capital in destroying workers' self-organization both through structural analyses of the relationships among productivity, wages and unionization and through the statements of employers themselves. We then show how capital organized and mobilized itself to struggle against unions, demonstrating that its anti-union strategies were quite successful. Our results indicate generally that formal models of collective action must include the  counter-mobilization  of movement adversaries and suggest a fruitful strategy for linking the study of class conflict to that of social movements.

Structuralist perspectives have developed primarily in isolation from each other. Using new life-history data from the Federal Republic of Germany, we draw on three structuralist perspectives to specify more complete models of the mobility process. Specifically, we investigate the effects of organizational size, social class and industrial segmentation on job-shift patterns, using event-history methods. The findings show that recent structuralist perspectives which are commonly thought to be contradictory are in fact complementary.

Shihadeh	American Sociological Review	57	3	1992-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 306-314	American Sociological Association	fla		Easterlin's cohort-size hypothesis suggests that crime rates fluctuate according to the relative size of the birth cohort. We examine the hypothesis using arrest statistics from the Uniform Crime Reports for the years 1953 through 1989. This paper extends an earlier ASR article (Steffensmeier et al. 1987) and tests three hypotheses derived from the Easterlin framework: (1) whether cohort size is positively related to age-period-specific crime rates, net of age and period effects; (2) whether the effect of cohort size is stronger for property crimes than for violent crimes; and (3) whether the effect of cohort size is stronger for young adults than for older adults or is consistently additive across the life course. Results using two different procedures to assess the cohort-size effect generally contradict the hypotheses, leading us to question the usefulness of cohort size as an explanation of periodicity in crime rates and possibly in other social phenomena as well.

Cohen	American Sociological Review	50	3	1985-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 288-301	American Sociological Association	fla		Sociology faces a peculiar paradox: Every general sociological proposition is both true and false. On the one hand, one can easily find exceptions to most of the propositions which are advanced as general sociological principles. Yet, there are many instances in which general sociological principles are supported by empirical findings. As a consequence, it is not clear when some sociological principle is to be counted as false. This paper argues that a proper assessment of the state of sociological knowledge and the possibility of cumulative growth in sociology depends on resolving the true-false paradox. We argue that the paradox can be resolved if sociologists make the scope of their theories explicit. We offer a formulation of scope restrictions, demonstrate how the formulation resolves the true-false paradox, and illustrate the differences between the method proposed here and other strategies for making sociological theories conditional.

Powers	American Sociological Review	60	2	1995-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 222-246	American Sociological Association	fla		Descriptive accounts of the Japanese educational system often refer to the intense competition that characterizes college entrance examinations. This competition reflects the high degree of segmentation in the Japanese labor market; in Japan, the labor market sector in which one secures his or her first job has a major impact on socioeconomic opportunities throughout the entire work career. We analyze data on Japanese men entering the labor market from 1954 through 1975. Education is the major determinant of the sector of one's first job, but our results suggest that this effect primarily derives from the relative ranking of educational attainment within one's job-market cohort. Our findings support a job-competition queuing model in which education serves as a screening device that rations employment in the primary sector.

Sampson	American Sociological Review	51	6	1986-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 876-885	American Sociological Association	fla		This study uses survey data in conjunction with police and court records to examine the two-tiered effects of socioeconomic context on official police reaction to juvenile delinquency. The results suggest that neighborhood SES has an inverse effect on police contacts independent of actual law-violative behavior as measured by self-reported delinquency. On the other hand, individual SES has a negative influence on subsequent court referrels independent of both self-reported delinquency and police records. This general result holds for males as well as females, and persists despite controls for the prevalence, frequency and type of delinquency, race, family structure, delinquent peers, and gang membership. Discrepancies between self-reports of deviance and official records are thus not simply due to errors in measurement or different domains of behavior, but to structurally patterned sources of social control.

Making Facts in Science, Building Cases in Law	Stephan Fuchs, Steven Ward	American Sociological Review	59	4	1994-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 481-500	American Sociological Association	fla		There are two forms of deconstruction. Radical DECONSTRUCTION is rare. It is a sign of deep crisis and extraordinary skepticism among intellectual workers facing high uncertainty. Moderate deconstruction, however, occurs wherever conflicts over knowledge are built into the competitive and adversarial structure of social fields. We illustrate the social dynamics of moderate deconstruction for two specific cases: making facts in science and building cases in law. There are strategies of deconstruction common to both science and law which generalize untrustworthiness and thus economize on deconstruction costs. These strategies are rhetoric, ideology, procedure (or method), and reputation. Under certain conditions, moderate deconstruction turns into radical DECONSTRUCTION. This is most likely to happen in revolutionary science and in loosely coupled textual fields that have minimal hardware and social solidarity.

Richard Arum	American Sociological Review	61	1	1996-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 29-46	American Sociological Association	fla		Since the 1980s, public policy analysts and sociologists of education have increasingly focused on differences in school performance between public and private schools, but ignored the effect on public school student performance of the wide variation among states in the size of the private school sector. I demonstrate that public school students in states with large private school sectors have improved educational outcomes. Contrary to assumptions underlying the school-choice movement, however, the improved performance of public school students is not the result of increased organizational efficiency, but instead is the product of increased resources provided to public schools. The state thus takes an active role in protecting public sector providers. Institutional forces of inertia are less salient predictors of organizational behavior than are dynamic political processes and public school resource dependency on state financial sources of support.

Gibbs	American Sociological Review	54	3	1989-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 329-340	American Sociological Association	fla		Many issues and problems surround the conceptualization of terrorism. Most definitions of the term are indefensible if only because they do not speak to those issues and problems. An assessment of contending definitions can transcend purely personal opinions; and an assessment can be undertaken without a theory, even though an impressive theory is the ultimate justification of its constituent definitions. The present conceptualization goes beyond a definition of terrorism by emphasizing the definition's bearing on five major conceptual questions, each of which introduces a major issue and/or problem. Then it is argued that thinking of terrorism and other sociological phenomena in terms of control promotes recognition of logical connections and/or empirical associations, each of which could become a component of a theory.

In the 1936 Belgian legislative elections, the fascist Rexist movement captured over 30 percent of the popular vote in the province of Luxembourg, compared to only 9 percent in Hainaut. This study applies a general theory of regionalism to the case of Belgian fascism. The data support the paper's hypothesis that divergent regional patterns of Belgian voting in 1936 can be largely ascribed to the existence of particular modes of production that were responsible for distinctive regional constellations of interests.

In this paper I offer a conceptual framework for evaluating school tracking patterns as meritocratic, arbitrary, exclusive, or inclusive. Tracking patterns are hypothesized to emerge under different organizational contingencies. In particular, the type of structural constraints, the information flow within the school, and the cultural milieu evident among the staff are thought to affect the likelihood that one type of tracking pattern would emerge rather than another. A preliminary analysis suggests that student demand for a given track, which is a structural constraint, affects the degree to which exclusive tracking occurs. Social networks among students and teachers as well as teacher control over grouping policy are found to affect the likelihood of inclusive or exclusive tracking patterns, and the cultural milieu of the staff affects the degree to which exclusive or inclusive tracking occurs. No clear evidence for a press toward arbitrary tracking is observed.

Using data from the 1991 National Organizations Survey, we analyze a sample of 688 establishments to estimate multivariate models. The relationships between employer-provided job training and organizational size, unionization, and workforce composition are reduced or eliminated in most multivariate equations. Employer-provided training is most extensive in establishments with elaborate internal structures that operate in complex market environments.

Alexander, Linda Steffel Olson	American Sociological Review	59	6	1994-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 822-838	American Sociological Association	fla		Gender differences in most cognitive skills are fading, but a gender gap remains in secondary school that favors males in higher level math skills. This gap is not evident in elementary school where test scores for the two sexes are equivalent. However, the daily experiences of young boys and girls differ in ways that could affect their math skills in early adolescence. In a large random sample of youngsters in Baltimore, over their first two years of school, boys' gains in math reasoning achievement were more sensitive to resources outside the home than were girls'. In line with the greater responsiveness of boys' math skills to these neighborhood resources, the boys' math reasoning scores became significantly more variable over time than did the girls'. When differentiated course programs became available in middle school, this greater variability of the boys' math scores led the high-scoring boys in the  academic  program to outscore the girls in that program, even though in the total sample the means for boys and girls were about the same. In short, by the end of middle school a  gender gap  emerged in math among high-scoring youngsters. These trends in variability and the greater sensitivity of males to neighborhood resources combined with school tracking offer a new and more sociological perspective on the emergence of the gender gap in math in early adolescence.

Authors' professional characteristics, manuscript characteristics, review procedures, and referees' recommendations accounted for more than 58 percent of the variance in the editors' final decisions. Authors' professional characteristics had little effect. Manuscripts reporting qualitative data analysis were less likely to receive favorable recommendations from referees. Assigning editors had considerable influence via the recommendations of the referees they selected. Averaged recommendations of peer referees and the number of revisions accounted for the most variance in the editors' final decisions.

Kluegel	American Sociological Review	58	4	1993-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 443-464	American Sociological Association	fla		Although traditional anti-black prejudice among whites has decreased since the 1940s, social policies designed to assist blacks continue to face opposition and controversy. Accounts have pointed to self-interest, American beliefs about inequality, or persistent negative racial attitudes as underlying causes of widespread opposition to race-targeted policies. We hypothesize that opposition hinges on the explicitness of the race-targeting and whether the policy's goal is opportunity enhancement or equality of outcomes. We also hypothesize that the influence of individuals' self-interest, beliefs about inequality, and racial attitudes on opinions differs by whether or not a policy is race-targeted and by a policy's goal. We use data from the 1990 General Social Survey to analyze opinion toward race-targeted versus income-targeted opportunity-enhancing policies and toward race-targeted versus income-targeted equal outcomes policies. Results of these analyses lend general support to our hypotheses, and in particular, underscore the influence of group self-interest and perceived discrimination on white opposition to race-targeted policy.

Female footbinding in China lasted for 1,000 years but ended in a single generation. I show that each practice is a self-enforcing convention, in Schelling's (1960) sense, maintained by interdependent expectations on the marriage market. Each practice originated under conditions of extreme resource polygyny as a means of enforcing the imperial male's exclusive sexual access to his female consorts. Extreme polygyny also caused a competitive upward flow of women and a downward flow of conjugal practices, accounting for diffusion of the practices. A Schelling coordination diagram explains how the three methods of the Chinese campaign to abolish footbinding succeeded in bringing it to a quick end. The pivotal innovation was to form associations of parents who pledged not to footbind their daughters nor let their sons marry footbound women. The  convention  hypothesis predicts that promotion of such pledge associations would help bring female genital mutilation to an end.

Chen	American Sociological Review	59	1	1994-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 152-168	American Sociological Association	fla		In this study we assess the impact of a parent's death on adult children's physical and psychological functioning. Individuals from 24 to 96 years old were interviewed in 1986 (N = 3,617) and again in 1989 (N = 2,867). In the intervening three years, 207 respondents experienced the death of a biological parent. Our results indicate that when compared to adult children who are not bereaved, bereaved adult children experience a significant increase in psychological distress and alcohol consumption and a decline in physical health status. We also developed a theoretical framework to guide an analysis of group differences in adult children's reactions to a parent's death. Our analysis shows that some groups experience a substantially greater decline in functioning than others following a parent's death, whereas other groups actually experience improved functioning following a parent's death. Depending on the type of outcome assessed, several factors are associated with children's reactions to a parent's death: age and marital status of the child, gender of the child and the deceased parent, the quality of previous adult interactions with the deceased parent, and childhood memories of the deceased parent.

Almost universally, men have a greater risk of suicide than women. Furthermore, in economically developed countries, the risk tends to be highest for men in old age and for women in middle age. Age patterns of suicide in some Third World countries are fundamentally different than this. I test an interdisciplinary theory that focuses on role identities, economic development, and kinship institutions to account for these patterns.

The paper analyzes (1) the incorporation of utilitarian and behaviorist theories into exchange theory, (2) the transformation of Mead's social behaviorism into interactionist theory, (3) the evolution of Schutz's phenomenology into ethnomethodological theory, (4) the blending of Freud's psychoanalytic approach with elements of interactionist and phenomenological theory in structuration theory, and (5) the combining of Durkheim's structuralism with ethnomethodology and interactionism in interaction-ritual theory. For each of these five theories, the underlying and largely implicit theory of motivation is schematically modeled. Then, a composite of all the models is constructed in an effort to present a provisional theory of interpersonal motivation.

Goldscheider	American Sociological Review	52	2	1987-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 278-285	American Sociological Association	fla		Living independently before marriage is part of a broader pattern of family and demographic change characterizing modern societies since World War II. This paper examines expectations about premarital residential independence among young adults and is based on data from a survey of the high school class of 1980. That about 70 percent of young adults surveyed expect to move out of the parental home before marriage suggests that new norms are emerging which fit into patterns of independence in the transition to adulthood. There is substantial variation in factors affecting expectations about premarital residential independence. Young men more than young women, those with more parental resources, those who expect to marry at older ages, and those who do not have ethnic and religious ties that link them to their parental home until marriage expect to live independently. Religious, racial, and ethnic differences interact in complex ways with gender and socioeconomic status to influence expectations about premarital residential independence.

The violence forced the federal government to intervene, bringing victory for the movement. I challenge this thesis by examining the tactics and mobilization tools of the Birmingham movement. Evidence indicates that the local movement, because of its capacity for mobilization and its use of multiple tactics, generated the power that led to victory. A general discussion of social movement tactics derives from this case study. A social movement's internal organization, mobilization capacity, and tactical effectiveness are crucial to its failure or success.

Mikelson	American Sociological Review	60	6	1995-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 928-946	American Sociological Association	fla		Many African American parents create unique names for their children. Although in the United States there are no formal  rules  limiting the sounds parents may combine in creating a child's name, innovative names are not simply free-floating imaginative acts; they actually incorporate certain implicit practices found in the culture of both Whites and African Americans. Consequently, on hearing an innovative name, a stranger usually can guess the sex of the child. We are able to infer the linguistic features that influence innovations because these features appear more appropriate or less appropriate, depending on the sex of the child. We interpret our observations in terms of a cultural perspective on innovation which argues that the existing culture operates as an independent force to set bounds on creativity and imagination, independent of the influence of organizations or institutions. We also evaluate an alternative perspective. We analyze innovative naming patterns in the past 75 years and then consider both the influence of African heritage in America and the thrust toward African roots in recent decades. Here too we find a naming mechanism whereby adopted African names are modified by American linguistic conventions.

Thoits	American Sociological Review	51	2	1986-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 259-272	American Sociological Association	fla		Based upon assumptions that the social self is comprised of major role-identities and that role-identities reduce psychological distress, this paper examines the mental health advantage of married and unmarried men relative to comparable women as a function of multiple-role occupancy. Panel data from surveys of 1,106 adult heads of household in Chicago and 720 adults in New Haven are utilized. Possession of multiple role-identities (up to 6 in Chicago, 8 in New Haven) does significantly reduce distress in both samples. But identity summation does not consistently reduce gender or gender by marital status differences in distress. Further exploration revealed that men and women appear to experience equivalent levels of distress when they hold the same numbers and types of roles. When sex differences do occur, they appear to be a function of employment rather than of marriage, contrary to popular belief. Although structural inequalities in role occupancy appear to produce status differences in distress, future research will require deliberately stratified samples to adequately test this hypothesis.

Allan	American Sociological Review	61	4	1996-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 699-718	American Sociological Association	fla		Over the last 100 years, the United States has experienced four waves of corporate merger activity. The first occurred at the turn of the century, then again in the 1920s, the 1960s, and the 1980s. Most research on merger waves has focused on individual mergers within a wave. Our research focuses on the wave itself. We develop a theoretical model that centers on the actors who promote the mergers and on those changes in the political and economic environments that provide the resources these actors need to act. Specifically, we argue that a permissive state combined with increased access to capital market funds encourages fringe players to initiate the innovations that enable them to execute mergers. Merger waves occur when these actors become increasingly successful and their innovations are imitated throughout the business community. We provide empirical support for the model using data from the 1980's merger wave.

Denton	American Sociological Review	50	1	1985-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 94-106	American Sociological Association	fla		Prior research has estimated structural equation models of Hispanic and black spatial assimilation using census tract data in selected cities. While these models appeared to provide an unambiguous picture of ethnic and racial segregation in cities, their estimation from ecological data posed several conceptual and statistical difficulties. This paper replicates the earlier analyses using individual-level data from the 1970 Census. Prior findings were reconfirmed, thereby validating the theory of spatial assimilation and reinforcing earlier substantive conclusions. Results also indicate that, to the extent that ecological biases affect the pattern of results, errors of substantive interpretation are conservative in nature. Thus, models estimated using census tract data for 1980 (when appropriate micro information will not be available) are not likely to yield erroneous conclusions.

This case study provides a different analysis that emphasizes the problem of religious conflict and radicalism in early liberal-democratic ideology. Proponents of the new ideology rejected key tenets of their Puritan heritage, adopting deistic beliefs that legitimated pluralism and tolerance and opposed the older Puritan ideal of godly politics. Building on recent work in the sociology of culture, the paper outlines an analytic strategy for explaining change in ideological systems. Ideological change emerges out of the interaction of contextual pressures and intellectual precedents, as a collective response by ideological innovators to problems of authority. The analysis in this study shows how historical events can form an episodic context which structures this problem of authority.

Campbell	American Sociological Review	59	2	1994-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 169-186	American Sociological Association	fla		We examine the conditions that affected the progressivity of the individual income tax in the United States between 1916 and 1986. A multivariate time-series analysis shows how macroeconomic conditions, state imperatives, the organizational capacities of social classes, and political conditions have affected the progressivity and the symbolic component of the income tax. Progressivity is measured by the difference between the effective tax rates paid by moderate income and very high income families. The symbolic component of this tax is measured by the difference between the nominal tax rate and effective income tax rate paid by very high income families. The results reveal that changes in tax progressivity are due largely to macroeconomic and state fiscal conditions, such as unemployment, economic development, and budget deficits, although the organizational capacities of social classes and political conditions, such as labor organization and political participation, also have effects. Changes in progressivity are due primarily to adjustments in the rates paid by very high income families. However, the impacts of these conditions on tax progressivity changed somewhat when the federal income tax was transformed into a mass tax during World War II. Finally, political conditions have a relatively greater effect on the symbolic component of the income tax than on progressivity. Overall, this analysis supports a structural theory of the state in which the influences of politics and social classes on revenue extraction are circumscribed by macroeconomic and state fiscal conditions.

In a departure from past accounts, which have viewed early statistical developments in the United States as part of the history of separate academic disciplines, we analyze interdisciplinary relations and local institutional conditions in turn-of-the-century America to elucidate the adoption and use of statistical methods by James McKeen Cattell in psychology, Franz Boas in anthropology, Franklin H. Giddings in sociology, and Henry L. Moore in economics. We argue that these four thinkers were doing boundary work to legitimize their disciplines in a competitive interdisciplinary field, where they confronted the  newcomer's dilemma  of conformity versus differentiation in relation to other disciplines. All four innovators turned to statistical methods to demonstrate compliance with acceptable scientific models and at the same time carve out a distinctive mode of statistical analysis to differentiate their own discipline from the others. Our analysis also shows that these developments occurred only under certain local institutional conditions. Cattell, Boas, Giddings, and Moore were faculty members at Columbia University at a time when the University had gained a competitive lead in the area of statistics over rival universities. Determined to preserve this institutional advantage, Columbia provided a conducive setting for the interdisciplinary process of the incorporation of statistical methods into the social sciences.

Using the study of social norms as an example, this paper presents such a model based on components of variance. A key feature of the model is an explicit acknowledgment of error variance and its role in generating phenotypical dissensus in empirical data sets. The paper distinguishes among threshold dissensus, a condition in which persons differ in their intensities of adherence to norms, segmented dissensus, in which persons differ in the norms to which they subscribe, and structureless domains, a condition in which individuation in norms applies.

Molm	American Sociological Review	56	4	1991-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 475-493	American Sociological Association	fla		Recent theory and research on social exchange neglects a central concern of early exchange theorists: the satisfaction of actors with their relations. I apply the framework of contemporary exchange theory to the analysis of satisfaction using data from a series of experiments on power in exchange networks. I investigate four main questions: (1) how the base of power (reward or punishment) affects the relation between outcomes and satisfaction; (2) how within- and between-relation outcome comparisons affect satisfaction in negatively-connected exchange networks; (3) how dynamic exchange processes, net of exchange outcomes, affect satisfaction; and (4) how actors' positions of power affect each of these relations. Based on a theoretical analysis of how the structure, process, and outcomes of exchange should affect actors' expectations, I test predictions of their effects on satisfaction. The results provide substantial support for the hypotheses.

Matsueda	American Sociological Review	59	3	1994-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 365-390	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper builds on a symbolic interactionist theory of delinquency that identifies the locus of social control in the process of taking the role of the other. According to structural symbolic interactionism, role-taking is linked to the broader social organization through the concepts of generalized others, role commitments, and reference groups. We specify mechanisms affecting delinquency derived from the classical theories of labeling and differential association as special cases of this symbolic interactionist perspective. In contrast, social disorganization and social control theories contradict the assumptions of interactionism and provide a competing set of hypotheses. We translate these hypotheses into a covariance structure model of individual delinquency, and estimate it using panel data from a national sample of males. Our results support the symbolic interactionist perspective: Delinquency is affected by the elements of role-taking--associating with delinquent peers, having delinquent reflected appraisals, and holding delinquent attitudes. Moreover, contrary to social disorganization and social control theories, variables representing social disorganization, attachment, and commitment affect delinquency only indirectly through the differential social control process of role-taking.

Mason	American Sociological Review	52	2	1987-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 155-169	American Sociological Association	fla		Easterlin argues that his cohort crowding explanation of temporal variability in fertility trends applies to divorce, suicide, crime, and political alienation. Using two commonly employed survey items held to measure political alienation, we show that Easterlin's argument does not account for temporal variability in alienation between 1952 and 1980 in the United States. In addition, we find that a period basis, as distinguished from an age, cohort, or more elaborate basis, suffices to describe swings in alienation for the years under consideration. The size of young adult cohorts at each point in time, a key variable in Easterlin's argument, is correlated with the alienation of the entire adult population at each point in time. Although this result is consistent with the notion of a cohort crowding effect, it is not the one Easterlin predicted. The result is also, we argue, spurious. The issues associated with the rise of political alienation in the 1960s were primarily political and social, not economic, as would be required by a generic cohort crowding hypothesis.

Greeley	American Sociological Review	52	3	1987-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 325-345	American Sociological Association	fla		Theories about the secularization of society notwithstanding, basic indicators of participation in organized religion show little change over the 50 years covered by the survey research record. Among Protestants, we find that 1950 was a point of low attendance with no prior or subsequent deviation from an average of 40 percent weekly attendance. Among Catholics, attendance rates fell rapidly between 1968 and 1975 but not before or after. Since there are few other trends in the data, we focus on this period of falling attendance among Catholics. The key to falling attendance was the conjuncture of vocal defense of traditional sexual teaching by the Pope and other leaders in the face of rapidly growing opposition to that position among the church-going population. Many Catholics who disagreed with Church teachings on sexuality reduced their attendance (very few actually left the Church). Among active Catholics, opposition to the hierarchy continues to grow, but there has been no decline in attendance rates since 1975. From a latent variable analysis, we conclude that loyalty to the community and communal values is the factor that separates the active from the lapsed Catholics in the 1980s.

Hall	American Sociological Review	53	5	1988-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 679-692	American Sociological Association	fla		Kanter's (1968, 1972) theory of commitment posits that the mutual identification of individuals and a group emerges from resolving three problems of commitment: continuance of members' participation, their social cohesion, and social control over their relevant conduct. For 30 19th-century communal groups, Kanter found that groups employing commitment mechanisms were especially likely to be successful. A Weberian theory of social organization suggests that a group's basic cultural pattern of social organization shapes its capacity to use mechanisms to promote commitment. By locating Kanter's sample in a phenomenological Weberian typology of utopian communal groups, I found two distinct pathways of commitment associated with the  community  and the  other-worldly sect  as alternative types of communal religious social movements. Rational choice theory explicates how commitment problems are resolved (1) in the community through a pathway of social cohesion stemming from ethnicity; and (2) in the other-worldly sect by social control stemming from a spiritual hierarchy and confession.

This paper analyzes organizational case histories from the pro-choice (abortion rights) movement to explore the consequences of professional leadership and formal structure in social movements. Five general propositions are drawn from the case of the pro-choice movement: (1) professional movement activists do not initiate movements and create new tactics; the roles of movement  professional  and movement  entrepreneur  are distinct; (2) professional movement leaders tend to formalize the organizations they lead; (3) formalized social movement organizations (SMOs) help maintain social movements when environmental conditions make mobilization difficult; (4) professional leaders and formalized SMOs stimulate the use of institutionalized tactics; and (5) professionalization and formalization facilitate coalition work.

Hall, Mark Rodeghier, Bert Useem	American Sociological Review	51	4	1986-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 564-573	American Sociological Association	fla		We explain the variability of correlations between education and protest attitudes by specifying four processes and the conditions under which each operates. We postulate that education affects attitudes to protest by increasing commitment to civil liberties, by decreasing support for the use of violence, by increasing knowledge of the protesters' grievances, and by changing one's position in society and hence one's interests and identifications. These four processes account for over half of the variance in the obtained correlations in a secondary analysis of 17 surveys. We conclude that (1) education reduces support for the use of violence by either protesters or authorities; (2) education increases opposition to government repression; (3) when protest issues are class-related, education decreases support for issues identified with blue-collar groups; (4) education increases support for protest among persons remote enough from the protest to lack first-hand knowledge of it.

Job seekers find better jobs by contacting persons with superior knowledge and influence. These contact persons are usually others with whom the job seeker has only weak ties. Life history data from Germany demonstrate the necessity of considering the multidimensional nature of social ties and the interaction between social ties and status of prior job when predicting job mobility. Results suggest some modification of micromobility theory because individuals with high status prior jobs benefit from weak social ties, whereas individuals with low status prior jobs do not.

The model that we propose fits better than competing specifications; it yields a set of easily interpreted coefficients; and it generates new insights into the mobility regime of American males. We find that the contours of persistence differ across the various levels of aggregation in the occupational structure. The dominant form of persistence is a  clustering of counts  on the main diagonal; however, in selected regions of the mobility table, the effects of higher-level forms of persistence (e.g.,  stratum persistence ) are also quite strong. These results can be understood in terms of the social processes that generate each form of persistence.

Ross	American Sociological Review	52	2	1987-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 258-267	American Sociological Association	fla		Metropolitan dominance is conceived in network terms, with linkages between urban places consisting of organizational linkages between corporations' headquarters and production facilities. This approach offers advantages over previous research by identifying and quantifying the actual control linkages between places. A measure of network prominence was computed for 158 SMSAs and related to a variety of their ecological characteristics. The results were generally consistent with metropolitan theory: network prominence was related to population size, the presence of higher-order functions, and manufacturing activity. Prominence was also related to the presence of a state capital in the SMSA, suggesting overlap in government and business networks of influence relations similar to that in multinational corporations and national government networks. Change in metropolitan dominance was assessed by relating network prominence to predictor variables for both 1955 and 1975.

Based on an analysis of 65 intensive interviews with single women involved with married men, two stages of intimacy emerge: (1) exchanging secrets about the self or  Becoming Confidantes  and (2) creating mutual secrets or  Becoming a We.  The man's marital status, reinforced by his gender and socioeconomic status, has major effects concerning time constraints, expectations of temporariness, and privacy. These lead to intense feelings, idealization, and trust, which enhance the woman's commitment to perpetuating the relationship. The relationship is perpetuated through the construction of mutual secrets (rituals and property), which are imbued with intense symbolic significance. The strategies used to conceal the relationship increase the woman's dependence on it and reduce her power within it. Secrecy protects the interests of the powerful.

The emphasis on class struggle as the central dynamic has led class analyses to ignore a defining feature of social provision: its organization around race and gender. This historical case study of Richard Nixon's proposal for a Family Assistance Plan (FAP) to provide a guaranteed annual income to the working poor demonstrates that welfare programs not only mediate relations between classes but between politically dominant and politically repressed groups. By subsidizing the low-wage labor of black males and the childbearing role of black females, the FAP would reinstate male dominance over women in the household and retain white dominance over blacks in the labor market. The analysis suggests that while social policy may be used to increase female dependence, under certain historical conditions (in this case, those that existed in the South) social policy may enhance gender and racial equality. If economic power gained through redistributive measures from the state creates political opportunities for the excluded, then social policy becomes a liberating force.

Kreps	American Sociological Review	51	5	1986-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 699-716	American Sociological Association	fla		The paradox of action and order is the foundation of a developmental theory of organization and role. Organization is interpreted as a structural code composed of four elements: domains (D), tasks (T), resources (R), and activities (A). The four elements are individually necessary and collectively sufficient for organization to exist. Their emergence in time and space depicts four stages of organizing (1-4 elements present). A derived taxonomy of forms of association includes 64 possible combinations and permutations of elements culminating in 24 organizational forms. A structural dialectic is captured in a normally distributed metric of these 24 types of organizing. Six midpoint forms imply balance or tension between the forces of action and order. Detailed analyses of role-making and role-playing for these midpoint forms follow (38 cases of an original sample of 423 instances of organization from 15 disaster events). Four criteria are developed to distinguish between role-making and role-playing. Marginal distributions of role variables point to an increase in role-playing as each additional element of organization is enacted. However, the progressive character of role-playing is conditioned by emergent improvisations. These improvisations are indicative of role-making. Role dynamics are analyzed on their own terms and also as they relate to properties of organizational elements, enacting units, and disaster events.

Corporate restructuring was an attempt to overcome constraints on capital accumulation and resolve the contradictions and inefficiencies embedded in the previous controls over the managerial process. Formal controls over the managerial process were intensified to standardize decisions, improve product quality, and reduce costs. Additional findings include: (1) discretion over many decisions was centralized in decision centers where conceptual activities were performed; (2) the new formal controls increased surveillance over production managers; (3) many decisions were eliminated, which reduced the need for some managers and eliminated four layers of the managerial hierarchy; and (4) the corporation became more tightly coupled and more flexible. These Neo-Fordist controls entailed a structure of capital accumulation that separated conception from execution while enhancing control over the managerial process.

These studies conclude that mass media portrayals of violence cause imitative responses among the public. This paper examines the logic of this research, arguing that it does not meet the special burdens of proof associated with quasi-experimental studies that use aggregate data to make inferences about individual behavior. We present detailed evidence suggesting that imitation effects attributed to mass media events (prize fights and television news stories about suicides) are statistical artifacts of the mortality data, the timing of media events, and the methods employed in past research. The concluding section discusses some implications of our analysis for future studies of imitative violence and for other areas of research.

Day	American Sociological Review	61	3	1996-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 500-507	American Sociological Association	fla		The data adduced by Durkheim in support of the association between religion and suicide have seldom been subjected to scrutiny; when they have been so examined, the scrutiny has been based, of necessity, on data subject to the  ecological fallacy.  Data for the Netherlands, roughly contemporaneous with Durkheim's, that have recently come to light allow us to test the statistical support for Durkheim's theory about religion and suicide without risk of committing this  fallacy.  We find the Catholic-Protestant differential in suicide rates to be explicable entirely in terms of the practice of categorizing as  sudden deaths  or  deaths from ill-defined or unspecified cause  a large proportion of deaths among Catholics which would have been categorized as suicides had they occurred among Protestants. This finding raises doubts not only about Durkheim's theory but also about other causal theories concerning suicide that rely on a sociological rather than a psychological (or even idiosyncratic) explanation.

Wu	American Sociological Review	61	3	1996-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 386-406	American Sociological Association	fla		In previous work, my colleagues and I reported (1) a strong and statistically significant association between frequent changes in the numbers and types of parental figures a young woman has lived with and her risk of bearing her first child out of wedlock, and (2) weak and statistically nonsignificant associations between measures of a young woman's exposure to a mother-only family during childhood and adolescence and her risk of a premarital birth (Wu and Martinson 1993). A serious limitation of these findings is the absence of controls for income. Failure to control for income is especially problematic because the positive association between frequent changes in family structure and premarital birth risks could be an artifact of changes in economic circumstances that typically accompany family changes. In this study, I use prospective income histories and retrospective parental histories from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to determine if the effect of family instability on premarital births is an artifact of low, unstable, or declining family income. I find that low income, declining income, and frequent changes in family structure are associated with significantly increased premarital birth risks. The effects of income and change in family structure are largely independent.

Using data from the High School and Beyond study, sophomore cohort, 1986, we ask whether differences in achievement are accounted for by differences in parents' educational aspirations and parenting styles. Children who live with single parents or stepparents during adolescence receive less encouragement and less help with school work than children who live with both natural parents, and parental involvement has positive effects on children's school achievement. Differences in parental behavior, however, account for little of the difference in educational attainment between children from intact and nonintact families.

Conflicts can be resolved with minimal confrontation or argument in part because mediation de-emphasizes the adversarial nature of the situation and encourages cooperation. By analyzing the interactional organization of mediation hearings I show how mediation promotes agreement and minimizes argument. Mediation accomplishes these goals by an interactional organization that constrains how accusations and denials are positioned and formulated. Because this organization precludes the use of disputing techniques routinely used in ordinary conversation, disputes can be discussed and agreement reached without argument.

Other researchers who argue that behavior is the result of structural opportunity suggest an alternative approach to ethnicity but may underestimate the potential importance of culture. We propose a general parsimonious model of ethnic behavior that describes group behavior as constrained by three aspects of social structure--demographic opportunity, economic opportunity, and cultural heritage. A simple illustration of a method guided by this structural model is presented through the comparison of single ancestry rates for four white American ethnic groups (Italian, Polish, Slovak, Hungarian). We conclude that there are no differences in single ancestry rates between three of the four groups after structural opportunity has been controlled. Only the Slovaks demonstrate differences in single ancestry rates, after demographic and economic opportunity have been controlled. We suggest that those differences are the product of either historically unique demographic and political-economic experience not detected in our models or some unique cultural heritage or a combination of the two.

Human capital theory identifies individual characteristics of the founder as important prerequisites for survival. Organizational ecology emphasizes organizational characteristics and environmental conditions. We test basic hypotheses derived from both theories using retrospective data from a survey of 1,849 business founders in Germany. Organizational characteristics, especially number of employees and amount of capital invested, and organizational strategies, especially businesses aiming at a national market, are the most important determinants of business survival. The human capital characteristics of the founder, especially years of schooling and work experience and industry-specific experience, show strong direct and indirect effects as well.

The present paper evaluates the significance of race for psychological well-being and quality of life over the years 1972 to 1985 using data from the General Social Survey. Our analysis shows that blacks score consistently lower than whites on measures of psychological well-being and quality of life after controls have been introduced for social class variables, age, and marital status. Furthermore, the differences between blacks and whites remained constant between 1972 and 1985. We conclude that the significance of race as a determinant of psychological well-being and quality of life continues in spite of recent changes in the social and legal status of black Americans. Interpretations of these findings are offered.

Wilson	American Sociological Review	53	1	1988-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 113-126	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper tests the hypothesis that 1935-80 U.S. migration patterns both within and between metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas and regions and migrant/nonmigrant educational differences reflect regional changes in socioeconomic development and settlement patterns. Gross migration flows support the mobility transition hypothesis and the idea that developmental changes in metropolitanization structure the context of migration. Since the Great Depression, socioeconomic transformations of the periphery have reduced differences in migration patterns between the periphery and core regions. While migrants still have more education than nonmigrants, their differences vary systematically by regional socioeconomic development. Specifically, migrant/nonmigrant educational differences are (1) similar at origin and destination when both are at similar levels of socioeconomic development; (2) lower at the origin if the origin is higher in socioeconomic development; and (3) higher at the origin if the destination is higher in socioeconomic development.

Employing event-history techniques, we find that a first birth influences eventual high school graduation, but not in the way previous studies have suggested. Using a modified status attainment model incorporating a life-course perspective, we find that having a baby does not predict dropping out of high school. Women who have a baby while still enrolled in school and remain in school are just as likely to graduate as women who do not. Among high school dropouts, however, a birth reduces the chances of eventual graduation. Policy and theoretical considerations are discussed.

Ross, Chia-ling Wu	American Sociological Review	60	5	1995-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 719-745	American Sociological Association	fla		The positive association between education and health is well established, but explanations for this association are not. Our explanations fall into three categories: (1) work and economic conditions, (2) social-psychological resources, and (3) health lifestyle. We replicate analyses with two samples, cross-sectionally and over time, using two health measures (self-reported health and physical functioning). The first data set comes from a national probability sample of U.S. households in which respondents were interviewed by telephone in 1990 (2,031 respondents, ages 18 to 90). The second data set comes from a national probability sample of U.S. households in which respondents ages 20 to 64 were interviewed by telephone first in 1979 (3,025 respondents), and then again in 1980 (2,436 respondents). Results demonstrate a positive association between education and health and help explain why the association exists. (1) Compared to the poorly educated, well educated respondents are less likely to be unemployed, are more likely to work full-time, to have fulfilling, subjectively rewarding jobs, high incomes, and low economic hardship. Full-time work, fulfilling work, high income, and low economic hardship in turn significantly improve health in all analyses. (2) The well educated report a greater sense of control over their lives and their health, and they have higher levels of social support. The sense of control, and to a lesser extent support, are associated with good health. (3) The well educated are less likely to smoke, are more likely to exercise, to get health check-ups, and to drink moderately, all of which, except check-ups, are associated with good health. We conclude that high educational attainment improves health directly, and it improves health indirectly through work and economic conditions, social-psychological resources, and health lifestyle.

Williams	American Sociological Review	54	1	1989-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 67-78	American Sociological Association	fla		We examine processes that govern the selection of cross-race and same-race friends among high school students. Relying on social psychological theories of interpersonal attraction, we predict that individual- and school-level factors that affect the bases of attraction will influence the friendship choices. We test hypotheses using data from the sophomore and senior cohorts of the High School and Beyond Survey. Its large sample, national representativeness, and detailed information permit a deeper examination of the determinants of adolescent friendship formation than has been previously possible. Students are only one-sixth as likely to choose a cross-race than a same-race peer as a friend, and controls for school and individual variables account for only a third of this differential. While personal characteristics of individual students and pairs of students have the strongest effects on friendship choices, organizational characteristics of the school, such as tracking, are also important.

Simpson	American Sociological Review	51	6	1986-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 859-875	American Sociological Association	fla		The idea that certain types of corporate crime are caused by a squeeze on firm profits is a common theme in the current criminological literature. This paper, drawn from a study of 52  survivor  firms over 55 years of economic and criminal activity, extends this literature in several ways. First, the sources of firm profit-squeeze are expanded beyond the traditional categories of firm and industry to include macro economic influences. Second, a longitudinal design allows the estimation of changes in the extent and nature of corporate crime as a function of economic and structural changes over time. Third, the typically broad corporate crime typologies which are used to categorize illegal activities are eschewed in favor of greater conceptual and empirical refinement. Antitrust crime is decomposed into specific crime types and predicted by a multilevel economic model of profit-squeeze. The findings suggest that only certain forms of antitrust criminality are related to profit-squeeze; others occur within a munificent environment while some are unrelated to economic conditions. The implications of these findings are discussed as well as directions for future research.

Interviews with 471 parents in 1980 and their adult offspring in 1992 address three related issues: (1) What are the effects of childhood, parental, and family influences on the religiosity of adult offspring? (2) What factors condition the ability of parents to transmit their religiosity? (3) How do the recent experiences of adult offspring modify earlier family influences on religiosity? The results suggest that three sets of variables aid the transmission of religiosity--parental religiosity, quality of the family relationship, and traditional family structure. One's religiosity is determined largely by the religiosity of one's parents. Parent's marital happiness, parent-child support, moderate strictness, and a working husband/nonworking wife increase the ability of parents to transmit their religious beliefs and practices. Although the recent experiences of adult offspring affect their religiosity, these experiences do not reduce the influence of parents and family context.

Soule	American Sociological Review	53	1	1988-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 26-40	American Sociological Association	fla		White-collar internal labor markets are typically segmented in various ways. Job ladders, job ladder groupings, and tiers create a complicated set of boundaries that make advancement contingent on such factors as the chances for advancement in a job ladder, the chances to move to other job ladders that offer greater opportunity, and the distribution of preferred statuses that influence promotion outcomes. This paper shows how these contingencies created gender differences in promotion rates in the federal civil service during the middle 1970s. Gender promotions varied by level. The greatest female disadvantage occurred near the boundary between the lower- and upper-tier grades. No gender difference was found in the higher grades, and no zero-order difference existed in the lower grades. Gender differences in grade promotion were largely explained by differences in ladder-specific opportunities. But significant gender differences in promotion from the lower- to the upper-tier remained, even when personal attributes and organizational location were controlled.

If each individual makes an optimal choice, all are worse off. One type of social dilemma, a  communication dilemma,  exists when it is in the collective interest of network members to communicate, but in each separate individual's interests to hoard information. Results from two laboratory experiments support the hypotheses that such conflicts are affected by the structure of the network. Moderately central individuals in decentralized networks are the most vulnerable.

Alternative formulations of the strength-of-weak-ties hypothesis suggest (1) weak ties relay job offers more frequently than strong ties, or (2) weak-tie offers are drawn from a better distribution. A formal model shows that both formulations imply a correlation between network composition and a job seeker's minimum acceptable wage. However, the use of a weak tie is never associated with higher expected wages under the first formulation, and is only sometimes associated with higher expected wages under the second formulation. These results suggest that researchers should focus on job seekers' network structures.

Yet such economically centered models of stratification often disregard factors like physical violence and the intra-household distribution of resources that shape power and autonomy for all group. Using a sample of textbooks from 1983 through 1988, we examine  mainstream  sociology, that is, the sociology that teachers, students, and textbook publishers have treated as nonproblematic. We show how stratification analysis is applied to class, race, and gender in profoundly unequal ways. Rather than integrating macro, meso, and micro levels of social structure as interactive and mutually determinative in their discussions of race, class, and gender, introductory sociology textbooks segregate stratification processes. They discuss class at the societal (or macro) level of analysis, gender at the individual (or micro) level, and race at a group (or meso) level. We analyze the quantitative and qualitative elements of the coverage of class, race, and gender in indexes, texts, pictures, and captions, and suggest that attention to feminist theories of gender would produce a more integrated, multilevel, and interactive view of stratification.

The first concerns the justifiability of operationalizing enclave participation on the basis of place of residence, as done in recently published research. The second and third pertain to the effects of ethnic economy participation on entrepreneurs and workers, respectively. The fourth deals with determinants of self-employment among ethnic minorities. Two data sets are employed in this analysis: the 1980 Census individual sample for Cuban-born adult immigrants in South Florida and a 1983-86 longitudinal survey of Mariel entrants in the same area. These two independent data sets permit a more authoritative evaluation of the hypotheses. They also allow an assessment of the extent to which earlier findings about the pre-1980 Cuban-born population apply to the more recent entrants. Results consistently contradict depictions of ethnic enterprise as vehicles for exploitation and of enclaves as mere residential agglomerations. These structures are defined by physical proximity of firms, not dwellings. Ascriptive factors--primarily gender and marital status--play a decisive role in the emergence of enclave enterprise net of human capital endowments. Theoretical implications of these findings, in particular the relationship between intact nuclear families and the rise of an entrepreneurial minority, are discussed.

Theory attributes this relationship to the state's attempt to control labor surpluses. Studies testing the Rusche and Kirchheimer (1939) thesis yield questionable results, however, because they rely on convicted offender data. Using longitudinal data and a Box-Jenkins Autoregressive-Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modeling method, we investigate the effect of unemployment rates on pretrial incarceration rates. We include controls for arrest rates, jail capacity, and three court processing variables. Although our preliminary bivariate analysis revealed that the aggregate unemployment rate was significantly and positively related to pretrial incarceration for misdemeanors, this correlation became nonsignificant in the ARIMA analysis. The relationship between unemployment and the incarceration rate for pretrial felony defendants was also nonsignificant. Taken in total, our results suggest that the Rusche and Kirchheimer thesis overstates the importance of unemployment in explaining levels of incarceration.

Cohen, Xueguang Zhou	American Sociological Review	56	2	1991-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 179-188	American Sociological Association	fla		We examine the impact of team, organizational, and societal status characteristics on interaction patterns in long-term work groups. Data are from 2077 respondents representing 224 research and development teams drawn from 29 large corporations. Hypotheses based on status characteristic theory are supported: Both external (organizational and societal) and internal (team) status characteristics affect team interaction. When status within a team is controlled, only one external characteristic has a significant positive effect. Team status, in turn, is significantly affected by each of the external characteristics studied. While most of these external characteristics may reflect a team member's past performance, gender, when past performance is controlled, also has an independent effect on team status with males being accorded higher status. This suggests that competence and performance are not the sole bases for team status. Status processes in enduring work teams behave very much like those observed in ad hoc groups: Beliefs associated with diffuse status characteristics affect the ordering of interaction.

However, this research has not given adequate attention to the reciprocal effects of the self-concept and various social and personal factors. A panel of 1886 adolescent boys is used to explore the reciprocal relationships between self-esteem and three problems of youth: juvenile delinquency; poor school performance; and psychological depression. We find that low self-esteem fosters delinquency and that delinquency may enhance self-esteem. These reciprocal effects differ among socioeconomic status groups. The relationship between self-esteem and school performance is primarily attributable to the effect of school performance on self-esteem. Finally, the causal relationship between self-esteem and depression is bidirectional. Substantive, methodological, and policy implications of these findings are discussed.

Using content analysis, we analyze the  packages  of ideas contained in congressional bills proposing (since 1945) to regulate how employers and unions deal with gender differences and employees' family obligations. We focus on one step in the policymaking process--the formal introduction of the ideas to the legislature in the form of a bill--and document the range of such ideas and their patterns of support over time. We find a narrow range, consisting of three packages of ideas concerning work, family, and gender: a  separate spheres  package, an  equal opportunity.  package, and a package that stresses  work-family accommodation.  The equal opportunity package has received by far the most support and separate spheres the least; support for work-family accommodation has increased rapidly in the last decade.

Geschwender, Rita Carroll-Seguin, Howard Brill	American Sociological Review	53	4	1988-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 515-527	American Sociological Association	fla		Ethnicity in Hawaii is approached as a social construct created during expansion of the capitalist world-system.  Haole  typically refers to persons of European extraction, while  Local  normally refers to those of non-European origin. Portuguese-Americans are of European origin but are considered Locals. We argue that this anomaly was brought about by the different origins of two groups in the world-system. The first Europeans came to Hawaii from the capitalist core, brought capital, and soon dominated both the economy and the polity. In contrast, Portuguese immigrants came from the periphery to serve as plantation laborers. The large initial class difference inhibited subsuming both groups within the same ethnic designation. The combined class and ethnic cleavages created a set of historical structures that reproduced these very differences. Although both Haoles and Portuguese-Americans became internally class-differentiated over time, significant class differences remained, which helped reproduce ethnic differentiation.

This paper focuses exclusively on publicized execution stories during 1950-80. An analysis of monthly data reveals a negative relationship between publicized executions and the incidence of homicide. On the average, a publicized execution story is associated with a drop of 30 homicides in the month of the story. In contrast, little-publicized executions have no impact on homicide. However, the relationship between publicized executions and homicides is relatively weak compared with other independent variables. In particular, the percent of the population in the homicide-prone age group is 21 times more closely associated with the monthly homicide rate than is the publicized story variable.

I compare the wage determination process for employees in the rural public sector, rural private sector, and the urban state sector. Data are from two sample surveys conducted in China in 1986. Multisample structural equation analysis shows that wage determination in rural industry is similar for both public and private enterprises, but differs from wage stratification in the urban state sector. The findings suggest that rural industrialization in China does not simply replicate urban industrialization. Property-rights theorists may have overemphasized the relationship between types of property ownership and the behavior of firms, including the wage determination process.

Walder	American Sociological Review	60	3	1995-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 309-328	American Sociological Association	fla		All ruling communist parties have allocated career opportunities to the loyal in an effort to promote conformity and discipline within their ranks and among their subjects. Yet little is understood about how these political reward mechanisms operate. I offer a model of selective political screening and incorporation, using survey data from urban China to demonstrate the existence of two distinct career paths that lead to a divided elite. One path requires both educational and political credentials and leads to administrative posts with high prestige, considerable authority and clear material privileges; the second path requires educational but not political credentials, and leads to professional positions with high occupational prestige but little authority and fewer material privileges. This division of the elite and the relatively small magnitude of administrators' material privileges reveal some striking vulnerabilities in China's political institutions to the growth of a market economy.

Breault	American Sociological Review	54	6	1989-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1048-1053	American Sociological Association	fla		In a recent issue of ASR, Finke and Stark (1988) reported results that contradict long-standing views on the relationship between religious pluralism, urbanism, and religious participation. They argue that religious pluralism and urbanism are positively related to religious participation. The present paper disputes the generality of Finke and Stark's findings with both methodological criticisms and new data. With regard to pluralism, although the traditional views are supported, a new theoretical interpretation is introduced and empirically supported: religious pluralism appears to have differential effects on religious participation, depending on the religious makeup of the religious community along a liberal-to-conservative continuum. Finally, the best evidence suggests that there probably is not an important rural-urban difference in the rate of church adherents today.	
10.2307/2095692	10.2307/2095692	A Flexible Procedure for Adjusting Rates and Proportions, Including Statistical Methods for Group Comparisons	Clifford C. Clogg, Scott R. Eliason	American Sociological Review	53	2	1988-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 267-283	American Sociological Association	fla		This article presents some methods based on the  purging  concept that can be used to simplify the interpretation of multivariate relationships among discrete variables. These methods can be applied in general situations where one of the variables is a specified dependent variable, another is a specified group variable, and one or more other variables are  composition  variables or covariates. The composition variables are assumed to be associated with the group levels and can thus confound the interpretation of observed group differences in the dependent variable. These purging methods can be used to adjust rates for marginal or partial two-factor interaction between the group and composition variables and for three-factor interaction among the group, composition, and dependent variables. The method of direct standardization widely used in sociology, demography, and other areas is shown to be a special case of the purging method. Statistical inference for group comparisons is facilitated by the jackknife technique. The methods are illustrated with an example dealing with the preference for additional children.

The substantive issue is the determinants of native-language maintenance among the Canadian Indian population. A simultaneous-equations model in which retention of an Indian mother tongue and various aspects of labor-force activity have reciprocal effects is contrasted with a model in which both language retention and economic activity are determined jointly by background characteristics such as education. Results support the latter model. This suggests that attempts to improve the economic conditions of native Indians (for example, by increasing education levels) may have a cost in terms of cultural maintenance.

Hargens	American Sociological Review	53	1	1988-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 139-151	American Sociological Association	fla		Rejection rates for scholarly journals show substantial variation between disciplines. Explanations of this variation have focused on two possible sources: variation in consensus and in space shortages. Longitudinal data on journal rejection rates show that they have been very stable over time and are largely unaffected by changes in submissions, impugning the argument that space shortages explain disciplinary variation in rejection rates. In contrast, a model of the manuscript-evaluation process can account for the observed variation in rejection rates and also casts light on additional characteristics of manuscript evaluation processes in different disciplines as well. Possible links between consensus and each of the elements of the model are discussed.

Yet, the regime did not radically alter the content of fascist theater. Standard accounts of the relationship between culture and the state that privilege the cultural product suggest that the Italian case was anomalous. Using archival materials, I lay out a conceptual framework for discussing the interaction between states and cultural institutions and apply it to Italian fascist theatrical policy from 1922 to 1940. The fascist regime pursued a policy of state paternalism towards the theater. The regime regulated producers of culture rather than cultural products and used organizational structures to legitimate a split between doing theater and writing theater--performance and text. The Italian case suggests that even a regime that claims to be totalitarian cannot create a national aesthetic: it also forces a re-examination of prior studies of states and cultural institutions.

Analysis of 30 occupations between 1890 and 1950 shows that occupational power promotes licensing legislation, but state governments also play a significant role. The state's role differs by type of occupation. Licensing legislation diffuses across states for specific occupations. These findings raise questions for perspectives that treat licensing as undifferentiated and see the state as a captive of industry and occupational groups.

This article argues that conflicts among the three principal elites--the clergy, monarchs and their officials, and lay landlords--are the critical dynamic that explains the contrasting developments of absolutism in the two countries. English monarchs won a horizontal national-level hegemony over rival elites at the cost of access to resources at the point of production, leaving them vulnerable to a class-based rebellion by landowners. In France, elites were amalgamated into an absolutist state by their conflicts, and thereby lost their separate identities as feudal exploiters as well as the opportunity to transform agrarian social relations to their sole advantage.

Hannan	American Sociological Review	54	4	1989-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 524-541	American Sociological Association	fla		A model of density dependence is proposed to explain regularities in the growth and decline of organizational populations. Density--the number of organizations--is assumed to be a function of the social processes of legitimation and competition. At low density, the model predicts that the legitimation process will dominate and will lead to high organizational founding rates and low organizational mortality rates. At high levels of density, competition will dominate, and consequently founding rates will decline and mortality rates will rise. The model is tested with hazard function models using data from nine newspaper populations spanning the 19th and 20th centuries and covering over 5200 newspapers. Analysis of founding rates provides strong empirical support for the model. Analysis of mortality rates reveals that the model holds for large populations.

Members expressed interests in six distinct dimensions underlying organizational-incentive systems, and these different aspects are specifically related to different types of member involvement, controlling for other personal and organizational attributes. Members with higher interests in normative and social inducements offered by their organizations are more likely to contribute time, money, and psychological commitment and to engage in internal participatory actions. Lobbying incentives are strongly related to external participation. Overtly utilitarian incentives such as material benefits, occupational rewards, and informational incentives are either unrelated to involvement or actually attract members unwilling to participate. The implications of these results for Olson's  by-product  or selective-incentive explanation of collective action are discussed.

We reverse the causal link and ask whether ethnic conflict affects the life chances of social movement organizations. We analyze the effects of ethnic conflict, fluctuations in the economy, and organizational density on the rates of founding and failure of white immigrant and African-American newspaper organizations in a system of American cities, and in New York and Chicago, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Our results indicate that hostility and violence encouraged white immigrants to found ethnic newspapers, whereas racial attacks significantly deterred the founding of African-American newspapers. Existing immigrant newspapers thrived under attack, whereas African-American newspapers did not. Thus, the results suggest that the consequences of repressive attacks on ethnic and racial communities depend on the levels of collective violence in addition to the resources controlled by the victimized group.

Consistent with other studies of elites, social prestige and club membership determine membership in the inner circle. Reflecting French institutions, having worked in the Treasury is also important. Who is friends with whom depends on social prestige, political party membership, and residence, but most importantly on whether or not one graduated from the top French school for administration (ENA). The inner circle is sociometrically divided into moieties, or  cliques,  which are both cooperative and competitive. Moiety membership is determined by politics, ENA background, and prestige and is also correlated with common board membership. The concept of  enforceable trust,  a key factor in high finance, explains the importance of friendship in this elite. There are sufficient friendship ties between the moieties to suggest that, despite the privatization of financial institutions engendered by the new non-Socialist government, the basic character of French finance will remain the same.

We challenge the state-centered approach by analyzing the interrelationship of state and society, focusing on the convergence of state institutional capacity and class capacity. We explore the social origins of state-building in U.S. agriculture and show the historical class biases of state agricultural institutions. Through an examination of the major New Deal farm policy themes, particularly the rise and fall of reform in the Agricultural Adjustment Administration and the Resettlement/Farm Security Administration, we demonstrate the interdependence of state and society. We analyze state/society relations as they affected each agency and examine class conflict both within and beyond the state. Instead of assuming the separation of the state and social forces, we investigate how they interact to shape policy.

Burns	American Sociological Review	51	6	1986-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 767-780	American Sociological Association	fla		The study of social indicators is valuable for understanding the role that the social sciences play in the political arena. One common pattern is for a particular social indicator to become frozen in place once it takes on political significance, and this can result in ironic consequences. This study traces out the case of indicators of aggregate productivity trends in the United States. These measures were initially developed as part of an underconsumptionist argument that was linked to the political left, but there was considerable debate over different measurement schemes. Over time, one particular measure of trends in aggregate productivity became central for wage negotiations and for government policy. This created a context in which the slower rates of growth of this measure of productivity in the 1970s helped to validate the views of those on the political right who saw the need for greater restrictions on wage gains and government civilian spending. The paper raises questions about the value of this particular measure and ends by emphasizing the problems of locking in place an  objective  social indicator when the reality being measured is in continual flux.

Dobbin	American Sociological Review	53	4	1988-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 497-514	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper examines historical differences in personnel practices among U.S. industries to explore the roots of modern  bureaucratic  work control. We report multivariate analyses of data describing organizational personnel practices, collected by the National Industrial Conference Board between 1935 and 1946. We find evidence of three early strands of bureaucratic labor control in different industrial sectors: worker allocation and job-evaluation techniques, which evolved from scientific management in modern assembly-line industries; internal labor-market mechanisms in white-collar nonmanufacturing; and practices related to seniority and the formalization of rules in unionized and skilled industries. Our analyses suggest that the institutional environment and the historical period of an industry's founding were among the central contingencies shaping labor control in a particular sector, as were several factors that past research has emphasized more, such as technology and skills, labor market conditions, and unionization. Our analyses thus corroborate some previous accounts of industrial differences in  bureaucratic control,  while also suggesting some revisions concerning where, when, and why employment relations first became bureaucratized.

Drawing on elements of the resource dependence and social class models of intercorpoorate relations, we examine the effects of volume of transactions between industries, the economic leverage of one industry over another, and interlocking directorates, on the similarity of contributions between dyads created by fourteen major industries. Volume of transactions is negatively related to consensus, as are direct interindustry officer interlocks. However, economic leverage between industries is associated with increased consensus, suggesting the importance of this variable as a source of conflict resolution within the business community.

Analysis of hypotheses emerging from four perspectives on abuse suggests that a focus on economic stress is most useful in explaining cross-national variation in child homicide in developed countries. High levels of female labor-force participation, coupled with low levels of female status and welfare spending, result in high child-homicide rates. No perspective provides hypotheses able to explain cross-national variation in child homicide in less-developed countries. The limitations of the present study are noted and avenues for future empirical and theoretical work are discussed.

Departing from these interpretations, this paper argues that understanding Parson's early method requires an understanding of the sociointellectual context of his early writings and the social position he occupied within that context. Parsons's methodological ideas are analyzed in relation to the neoclassicist-institutionalist controversy in early twentieth-century American economics and the methodological views of leading economists and philosophers of science at Harvard during the same period. The position that Parsons occupied at Harvard, moving from the high-status field of economics to the low-status field of sociology, led him to accept the basic methodological argument of neoclassical economists--and to shape from it an equivalent method for sociology. Such an historical analysis produces a systematic and coherent interpretation of Parsons's early methodological work, resolves the major contradictions in the existing scholarship, and reveals the limitations of the Parsonian method, especially when contrasted to the Weberian approach which it purportedly transcended.

Rank	American Sociological Review	54	2	1989-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 296-304	American Sociological Association	fla		This article examines the incidence and determinants of fertility among women on welfare. The analysis reveals that welfare recipients have a relatively low fertility rate. This rate is below that of women in the general population and is not an artifact of a more favorable demographic structure. Furthermore, the longer a woman remains on welfare, the less likely she is to give birth. The underlying mechanisms behind these findings are explored in the discussion section.

I evaluate these three theoretical explanations by examining the contributions to the U.S. presidential campaign of 1936 made by three segments of the capitalist class: members of wealthy capitalist families, corporate elites, and members of the  inner circle  of interlocking directors. I find that although one out of three capitalists contributed to the presidential campaign, only one out of 12 contributed to the Democratic party. Members of the inner circle and corporate elites were more likely to contribute to the Republican party than were members of capitalist families. Members of southern and Jewish capitalist families were among the major contributors to the Democratic party. Finally, corporate elites from regulated industries were less likely than were those from other industries to contribute to the Republican party. These results provide some confirmation of  state autonomy  theory and partial confirmation of certain elements of  corporate liberal  theory. However, they suggest modification of the  hegemonic competition  theory.

Elites are defined by their control over organizational apparatuses for appropriating resources from non-elites. An elite in pursuit of its interests is constrained primarily by coexisting elites and secondarily by inter-class relations of production. The effects of elite and class conflict upon elite organizations and relations of production are traced. Conflict among feudal elites is identified as the primary determinant of the form and extent of social structural change in three historical cases: Florence during the Renaissance, England in the century leading up to the 1640 Revolution, and France from the sixteenth through eighteenth centuries.

This study of Abraham Lincoln during World War II extends a semiotic interpretation of culture as it focuses on  memory as a social frame.  Memories invoked in the context of a present crisis are rooted in generational experience. One-third of all Americans living in 1940 were born during the late nineteenth century, when Civil War resentments were fading and remembrances of Lincoln were more positive and vivid than ever. This generation understood the meaning of World War II by  keying  it to the Civil War. Patterned arrays of images of Lincoln were invoked by local and federal agencies to clarify the purpose of World War II, legitimate the preparations for it, and then to orient, inspire, and console the people who fought it. As a model for the present and of the present, images of Lincoln comprised a cultural system that rationalized the experience of war. I compare and contrast memory as a cultural system with constructionist theories of collective memory and discuss it in light of the erosion of American society's grand narratives.

This paper develops a theory of market transition which argues that, in reforming socialist economies, the transition from redistributive to market coordination shifts sources of power and privilege to favor direct producers relative to redistributors. The shift improves incentives for direct producers, stimulates the growth of private markets, and provides to entrepreneurs an alternative path for socioeconomic mobility. A set of hypotheses test the market transition theory with household- and village-level data.

If macrosociological theory is to progress, and not merely proliferate, several major changes are needed in the way theory is usually formulated. Above all, theories must become falsifiable. This will require that key concepts be stated in an operationally unambiguous manner and that relationships among variables also be specified unambiguously. In addition, theories ought explicitly to incorporate biological and environmental constants and not leave them implicit or ignore them, as is too often the case. Finally, theories should be multilayered, with a general theory employing a covering principle to identify a key variable or variables on which a series of derivative special theories can be based. Above all, theory construction requires greater rigor and discipline than is currently the norm.

In this paper, however, we find a weak, but significant effect of productivity on the destination prestige of 274 job changes by academic physicists, chemists, mathematicians, and biologists. Major determinants of the prestige of the destination department are prestige of the prior job, prestige of the doctoral department, and the number of articles published in the six years prior to the move. Measures of citation frequency have no detectable effect, however. For promotion in rank at the occurrence of a job change, the major determinants are origin rank, professional age, and citation frequency.

Dynamic models and a focus on the context of violence allow examination of these issues. I compare an overall count of political deaths from The New York Times Index with a comparable count from a more complete database. The statistical inferences generated using the two measures are virtually identical. More important, disaggregating political deaths by the agency responsible for the deaths shows that anti-state violence, pro-state vigilante counterviolence, and state violence follow separate, distinctive dynamics. Although standard newspaper sources may provide reliable measures of political violence, they do not guarantee a complete examination of its complex dynamics.

Based on a case study of the Soviet wood industry, we argue that there will be no economic transition so long as enterprises retain two historic features, namely anarchy in production and bargaining in external relations. Far from constituting a revolution, the withering away of the party state has exaggerated the pathologies of the old economic order. Barter has become more important, conglomerates have strengthened their monopoly and workers have greater control of the shop floor. If there is a movement toward a market economy at all, it is toward a form of merchant capitalism that deepens economic underdevelopment and thwarts the rise of modern bourgeois capitalism.

This is misleading given that ethnomethodology is indifferent to structure at any level. Instead, ethnomethodology transcends the terms of the debate with a focus on empirical social practices whereby both microstructure and macrostructure are produced by and for the membership. This is also true of conversation analysis. Modifying Collins's  interaction ritual chains  to include this indifference to structure expands ethnomethodological understanding as well as Collins's theory.

We investigate whether international dependency incites rebellious political violence directly by mobilizing anti-imperialist and xenophobic movements, and indirectly by increasing relative deprivation and repression of nonviolent protest. Using a four-equation model, we examine the effects of dependency on rebellion independent of domestic causes, and then on three primary domestic determinants--income inequality, economic growth, and regime repressiveness. Our model includes economic dependence and military dependence, the latter measured by arms supply concentration, and controls for the legacy of colonialism. The findings indicate that both forms of dependency promote rebellion through their effects on the domestic class and state structure.

Analysis of dyadic relations at federal, regional, state, county, and municipal levels of government revealed that structural features interact to produce characteristic exchange flows, and the exchange of resources among these professionals affects perceptions of conflict. Professionals at higher levels of government were more likely than those at lower levels to do favors and provide information, particularly when they were more central in the professional network. However, these exchange patterns (favors and information) were associated with conflict in relationships. I interpret this as a result of status incongruence in dyads that match actors at higher levels of government but lower organizational positions with actors at higher organizational positions but lower levels of government.

Bradshaw	American Sociological Review	53	5	1988-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 693-708	American Sociological Association	fla		Over the past decade, students of development have conducted a substantial number of quantitative cross-national studies. On balance, these studies provide support for some portions of the dependency/world-system theory, showing a negative relationship between foreign capital penetration and both economic growth and equality. However, case studies indicate that the dependency perspective should not be generalized across countries. Individual countries have unique circumstances that govern the level and type of economic dependency affecting them. This paper uses time-series analysis to test the validity of dependency arguments in post-independence Kenya. The results suggest that Kenya is experiencing a transition from classical dependency to dependent development. This process is characterized by an increase in foreign investment in manufacturing, prompting economic expansion in the  modern  sectors of the country. Such uneven development tends to enrich elites associated with foreign capital.

Researchers interested in workers' well-being have suggested that increased worker autonomy and participation in the labor process may undermine worker solidarity. Available answers to this question have been difficult to confirm because of the nature of the data required. Ethnographic methods are able to probe deeply inside a workplace to ascertain levels of worker solidarity, autonomy, and participation. However, the uniqueness of each ethnographic account restricts the testing of hypotheses about worker solidarity across a variety of contexts. We analyze English language ethnographic case studies of specific workplaces to systematically explore hypotheses about worker autonomy, participation, and solidarity. We find that autonomy has no effect on worker solidarity and that participation in work groups has a positive effect on at least one aspect of solidarity. We also explore the relationships between other aspects of work and solidarity and offer suggestions for future research.

In rebuttal, other sociologists argue that the use of ratio variables is justified when the ratios themselves, rather than their components, are of  theoretical interest.  Both arguments are based on mistaken ideas about estimating casual effects in nonexperimental research. To realize unbiased estimates, social scientists often must control for a dominant confounding variable Z (e.g., population size). One control procedure is to divide the other variables by Z, i.e., to use ratio variables. Contrary to the  artifactuality  argument, the control procedure need not be restricted to instances where the ratios themselves are of theoretical interest. Conventional wisdom not- withstanding, theoretical interest is not a reliable guide for determining whether or not to use ratio variables.

Halaby	American Sociological Review	53	1	1988-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 9-25	American Sociological Association	fla		Current sociological models of job mobility suppress the intervening action and information mechanisms that link structural constraints to job shifts. To remedy this, this paper joins core features of structural-mobility models to key elements of economic approaches to job change in an analysis of the employed worker's decision to search the market for a better job. The analysis highlights the complementarity of structural and action approaches by conceptualizing the forces governing the search decision in terms of the principal dimensions--opportunities and achievement gains--underlying job-mobility models. The basic framework is extended to include the quality of a worker's initial screen of a prospective job as a mechanism that promotes search. The concepts of opportunities, gains, and screen quality are then used to explain male-female differences in mobility orientations. The empirical findings both reinforce structuralist assumptions and underscore the promise of applying to the study of mobility processes the kind of action approach recently advocated by Coleman (1986).

Modernization theory asserts that the destabilizing effects of industrialization on domestic institutions and actors generate political conflict in an inverted-U relationship. World-system theory argues that conflict increases in less developed countries when they become peripheral in the international division of labor. I use structural modeling (LISREL) to evaluate these hypotheses cross-nationally for the years 1970 through 1981. The results fail to support the curvilinear modernization model and show peripheralization to contribute to political conflict only indirectly through related increases in income inequality and vulnerability to the destabilizing effects of the world economy. Combining the two models and taking into account economic growth and ethnic separatism, the effects of peripheralization on political conflict are indirect, mediated by vulnerability and income inequality. The effects of modernization on political conflict are linear and indirect, mediated by income inequality and regime repressiveness. Both peripheralization and modernization contribute to political conflict through their effects on domestic economic conditions, social stratification, and state structure.

Concern with universalistic factors in promotion has prompted debates over two issues. First, why do female scientists advance more slowly than male scientists, and why do so few reach the rank of full professor? Second, is promotion driven by the sheer volume of published work as opposed to its quality? Event history analyses clearly indicate that quantity of publications is far more important than various measures of quality of publications in predicting rank advancement; and women are less likely to be promoted than men. About one-half of this sex difference is attributable to differences in levels of variables affecting promotion. Remaining differences are a result of differences in expected timing of promotion to associate professor and to the negative effects of department prestige on promotion to full professor for women.

Macy	American Sociological Review	56	6	1991-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 730-747	American Sociological Association	fla		Granovetter's threshold model of collective action shows how each new participant triggers others until the chain reaction reaches a gap in the distribution of thresholds. Hence outcomes depend on the network of social ties that channel the chain reactions. However, structural analysis is encumbered by the assumption that thresholds derive from changing marginal returns on investments in public goods. A learning-theoretic specification imposes less stringent assumptions about the rationality of the actors and is much better suited to a structural analysis. Computer simulations suggest that threshold effects may be the key to solving the coordination problem: When individual choices are contingent on participation by others, this interdependence facilitates the coordination of contributions needed to shift the bistable system from a noncooperative equilibrium to a cooperative one. Further simulations with low-density networks show that these chain reactions require bridges that link socially distant actors, supporting Granovetter's case for the strength of weak ties.

White, Alan Booth	American Sociological Review	50	5	1985-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 689-698	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper separates the effects of remarriage and presence of stepchildren on the stability and satisfaction of second marriages. Using a nationwide probability sample of 1,673 married individuals interviewed in 1980 and again in 1982, we show that the higher divorce rate among remarriages is limited to the most complex from or remarriage: where both spouses have been previously married and there are stepchildren in the household. Although remarriages, as marriages, can be just as happy as first marriages respondents with stepchildren report significantly less satisfaction with their family life than respondents with biological children. In addition to breaking up their families through divorce, stepfamilies are shown to move teenagers out of the home and empty the nest faster than biological families. We conclude that the presence of stepchildren is a destabilizing influence within remarriages and a major contributor to the somewhat greater rate of divorce.

The degree to which wages vary is an indicator of market efficiency and of whether a market wage exists. Holding constant differences in human capital, we found that the degree of wage variation in an academic labor market is negatively related to mobility within that market and positively related to the oversupply of labor. We also found that as wage variation increases, male-female wage differentials also increase.

James	American Sociological Review	54	6	1989-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 963-985	American Sociological Association	fla		This research examines the determinants of public-school segregation in 65 metropolitan areas in 1968 and segregation changes between 1968 and 1976. Models for central-city and suburban public schools permit estimation of the segregative effects that one system exerts on an adjacent system. In 1968, higher black proportions in cities enhanced segregation in suburbs, and higher proportions in suburbs promoted segregation in cities. Although city and suburban school segregation declined during the 1970s, segregation between cities and suburbs increased. Higher black proportions in cities put segregative pressure on their suburbs. The historic link between residential and public-school segregation was broken in southern but not in northern cities nor the suburbs of either region. Private-school utilization by whites had segregative effects on southern city systems, but not elsewhere. The boundaries between city and suburban school systems appear to foster racial inequalities within those systems as class theories predict.

This case study of the Division demonstrates that a theory of technocratization must account for both the reductions as well as the increases in the government's reliance on science. Explaining variation in state agencies' reliance on social science expertise requires an examination of the relationships among agency actors, state actors outside the agency, and class actors outside the state. Analysis must consider (1) social scientists' contribution to agency effectiveness; (2) agency impact on the class organization of society along with agency deviation from the ideology of the dominant class; (3) the balance of power in Congress and the Executive; (4) agency internal politics and its resource dependence on the external environment.

Unfortunately, clear procedures for interpreting its coefficients are not available. Using Walton and Ragin's (1991) tobit analysis of austerity protests in debtor nations, I show that tobit coefficients can be decomposed into two effects: (1) an effect representing an increase in the severity of protests in countries that have experienced protests, and (2) an effect representing a change in the probability of experiencing an austerity protest in countries that recorded no protests. Finally, an analogue to a fully-standardized regression coefficient is defined for tobit coefficients. Decomposing tobit coefficients reveals important additional findings that could not be discerned from the ordinary tobit coefficients.

The results show that zero-order relationships generalize in most instances to broadly defined populations. However, the effectiveness of weakly-tied and work-related informal contacts becomes greatly diminished when controls are added for measures of worker productivity characteristics.

My analyses address the permanency of welfare independence by type of exit and identify those women who manage to stay off welfare. I use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) for the years 1983 to 1988; the data contain monthly reports of welfare receipt (AFDC) and employment status. Returns to welfare are quite common and often occur soon after leaving: Over one quarter of the women in this study return to welfare within one year of exiting, and 42 percent return within two years. I find that repeat dependency on welfare is determined by social isolation, child-care responsibilities, human capital, and family economic status. Moreover, the route by which women exit welfare is less important to their chances of remaining off welfare than is the sequence of life events and changing circumstances that occur after their welfare exit.

Sutton, Frank Dobbin	American Sociological Review	61	5	1996-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 794-811	American Sociological Association	fla		Recent neoinstitutional analyses have associated the rapid diffusion of due-process governance mechanisms in the American workplace with government pressure for equal employment opportunity and affirmative action. We carry the argument forward in three ways. First, we focus on grievance procedures and employment-at-will clauses to show that the legalization process produces both rights-enhancing and rights-negating rules. Second, we focus on the private for-profit economic sector to test more effectively the efficiency and labor-control theories that have fared poorly in previous neoinstitutional studies. Third, we explore the interactions among personnel professionals, lawyers, and the state in the adoption of legalistic governance mechanisms. Results sustain the neoinstitutional argument, but also offer new support for efficiency and labor-control hypotheses.

Drass	American Sociological Review	52	2	1987-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 286-293	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper explores changes in the number of utopian novels published in Great Britain and the United States between 1883 and 1975 from a world-system perspective. A time-series analysis indicates that the publication of utopian literature was affected by changes in the world economy and by changes in the organization of the core of the world-system. On the basis of these findings, we argue that the world-system perspective represents a promising approach for the study of cross-national cultural change.

Most studies, however, still rely primarily on characteristics of fathers to measure family background status. Using a large national cross-sectional data set, this study describes the influence of mother's occupational status on children's educational attainment. I compare the strengths of maternal and paternal influences and use birth cohorts to examine whether the relative influence of mothers has changed. The main findings are: Maternal occupational status has a strong effect on schooling, this effect is independent of father's education and occupation, it persists through the schooling career, and it is as important for sons as for daughters. Some evidence suggests that the influence of mother's occupation has increased while the influence of father's occupation has decreased. In contrast, mother's education has always been as important as father's education. In general, the findings underscore the positive effects of maternal labor force participation on child outcomes through the high-status jobs many married women now hold. At the same time, this study suggests that the independent influence of mother's socioeconomic status may lead to an accumulation of educational advantages and disadvantages in subsequent generations, possibly reducing the intergenerational mobility of families.

Laub	American Sociological Review	61	3	1996-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 347-367	American Sociological Association	fla		Linking historical context with macro-social opportunity over the life course, we examine the social mechanisms by which military service in the World War II era fostered long-term socioeconomic achievement. Our analysis draws on a classic longitudinal study of delinquency that brings together data on childhood differences (e.g., IQ, early antisocial behavior), multimethod measures of military experiences, and adult socioeconomic outcomes among 1,000 men raised in poverty areas of Boston during the Great Depression. Supporting a theory of military service as a turning point in the transition to young adulthood, the results show that overseas duty, in-service schooling, and G.I.-Bill training at ages 17 to 25 generally enhanced subsequent occupational status, job stability, and economic well-being, independent of childhood differences and socioeconomic background. The benefits of the G.I. Bill were also larger for veterans stigmatized with an officially delinquent past, especially those who served in the military earlier rather than later in life. Overall the results underscore the potential of large-scale structural interventions in the lives of disadvantaged youths.

This paper examines hypotheses on the social contexts likely to foster insurrection through the use of a variety of quantitative indicators. The principal tool is logistic regression. Several predictors of rural upheaval suggest some of the revolt-generating processes and structures: economic integration into the market; the political penetration of local institutions by the central state bureaucracy; conflict over land use; and the strength of local communal organization. Many other explanations are not confirmed: literacy does not generate revolt nor does variation in the level of hardship have the consequences expected in much of the literature. Beyond the specific findings, the rural turbulence of 1789 shows itself to be an amalgam of quite diverse conflicts.

Pescosolido, Sharon Georgianna	American Sociological Review	54	1	1989-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 33-48	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper redirects debates over the religion-suicide link away from specific empirical quarrels to a consideration of Durkheim's general proposition regarding religion's protective power. We argue that his proposition must be tailored to social and historical contexts and that research must specify the underlying social mechanism at work. A consideration of historical trends leads to a more detailed specification of religions in analyses of contemporary cases, and more importantly, to an inductive elaboration of Durkheim's theoretical underpinnings. Analysis of religion's effects on United States county group suicide rates in 1970 reveals that religion continues to affect suicide rates, with Catholicism and Evangelical Protestantism tending to lower rates, and Institutional Protestantism tending to increase them. The presence of Jewish adherents produces a small but inconsistent protective effect. We attempt to account for these results first by examining a variety of standard religious typologies and second by examining evidence on whether religious affiliation reflects the operation of network ties. Finding this evidence suggestive, we move toward a network reinterpretation to clarify and elaborate Durkheim's theory.

Pallas	American Sociological Review	50	3	1985-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 409-420	American Sociological Association	fla		Although much has been written about the ineffectiveness of schools in imparting cognitive skills, there is little reliable knowledge by which to judge such claims. While the typical school-effectiveness study focuses on variation in educational outcomes between organizational units, there have been few studies which compared  school  and  non-school  populations. The purpose of this paper is to assess the contribution of formal schooling to cognitive development. Using data from the sophomore cohort of the High School and Beyond project, we compare patterns of cognitive development for graduates and dropouts over a two-year interval. With the effects of social background, sophomore test performance, and prior academic adjustment controlled, the average difference in cognitive test performance that may be attributed to the effect of staying in school is about one-tenth of a standard deviation. Moreover, dropping out of school has its most severe negative effects on disadvantaged students.

Alwin	American Sociological Review	56	5	1991-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 625-638	American Sociological Association	fla		Do birth-cohort differences in family configuration brought about by post-World War II increases in fertility explain declines in verbal test scores of young people in the 1960s and 1970s? Data from nine representative samples of the U.S. population in the General Social Survey data file confirm systematic declines in verbal scores for cohorts born in the post-World War II era, but reveal a trend beginning much earlier, at least with cohorts born prior to 1920, and one sustained through cohorts born in the 1960s. Despite the significance of these intercohort patterns, within-cohort factors are much more important in producing variation in verbal scores. Social and economic characteristics of the respondent's family of origin and amount of schooling are associated with the largest differences in vocabulary knowledge. Sibship size has a significant influence on the development of verbal skills, but is relatively less important than other family background factors. Birth order, however, is not independently linked to verbal scores. Finally, owing in part to the relatively weak role of family configuration in producing variation in verbal scores, there is no support for the hypothesis that cohort differences in family experiences account for the trends in verbal ability across cohorts in the U.S. population.

Benson, Esteban Walker	American Sociological Review	53	2	1988-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 294-302	American Sociological Association	fla		With a modified version of the white-collar sentencing model developed by Wheeler, Weisburd, and Bode (1982), we analyze sentences for a sample of white-collar offenders adjudicated in one federal court between 1970 and 1980. Contrary to Wheeler et al., in this study socioeconomic status is not related to sanction severity. Higher-status offenders are no more likely to be incarcerated than low-status offenders, nor do they receive longer sentences. We explore whether the relationship between socioeconomic status and sentence severity changed after the 1974 Watergate scandal. Our analysis suggests that the contextual characteristics of the districts studied by Wheeler et al. may account for their anomalous finding on social status. We argue that contextual variations in criminal sentencing extend both to social status and race.

What determined the marked variation in poor relief spending by German cities? Why did some urban elites adopt a form of subsidized unemployment insurance that strengthened socialist trade unions? The local welfare state is interpreted as an object of social conflict and an instrument of elite social domination. The social-political efforts of local elites are seen as embedded within three different, coexisting images of society: (1) an older social discourse that depicted the state and elites as confronting an undifferentiated mass of disorderly poor; (2) a paradigm emerging during the second half of the nineteenth century that focused on the  worker question  while discouraging workers from organizing and participating in social policy; and (3) a forward-looking,  proto-corporatist  discourse in which organized labor is brought into social administration in exchange for social peace. Because elites viewed poor-relief policy within the older social framework, relief spending increased in response to violent protests. Situated within the emergent proto-corporatist framework, municipal unemployment insurance was more likely to be introduced where the Social Democratic Party participated in local government but was not an extraparliamentary threat. The analysis also suggests that state capacities, such as the size and complexity of the bureaucracy, are not independent causal factors, but instead mediate the impact of other causal variables.

Hardy	American Sociological Review	54	5	1989-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 834-843	American Sociological Association	fla		This study examines the relationship between the processes of occupational mobility and persistence. Using manuscript census data from Indianapolis, 1850-1860, I assess the importance of selection effects on the likelihood of upward or downward mobility and on the socioeconomic status achieved by 1860, relative to 1850 origin status. Alternative speculations have argued that out-migrants either constituted a sort of  permanent floating proletariat  (and therefore were distinctly unsuccessful in terms of occupational advancement), or were particularly aggressive entrepreneurs (and therefore likely to be among the most successful). As an indirect test of these hypotheses, mobility and persistence were modeled as joint outcomes influenced by a common set of  unobserved  variables. The analysis of Indianapolis data shows that the sorting processes of occupational mobility and nonpersistence were affected by a similar set of observed characteristics, but that unmeasured variables exerted no net effects.

Lazerson	American Sociological Review	53	3	1988-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 330-342	American Sociological Association	fla		The success of small manufacturing firms is premised on their ability to develop alternative organizational strategies. This research, centered in Modena, a province of 600,000 located in the region of Emilia Romagna in north central Italy, demonstrates that when small companies expand through vertical and horizontal integration, they usually create other small firms that they control. This strategy preserves the advantages that Italian small firms enjoy in terms of state support, labor-market flexibility, and organizational efficiencies. Though this organizational form replaces market relations with bureaucratic relations, it bears little resemblance to the markets-versus-hierarchies theory of Oliver Williamson. Small firms integrate vertically and horizontally to insulate themselves from competition, not from the opportunistic practices of buyers and sellers. Indeed, greater reliance by small firms on bureaucratic relations is frequently compensated by their increased dependence on market relations through intensified subcontracting.

Using data on musical dislikes from the 1993 General Social Survey, I link literatures on taste, racism, and democratic liberalism by showing that people use cultural taste to reinforce symbolic boundaries between themselves and categories of people they dislike. Contrary to Bourdieu's (1984) prediction, musical exclusiveness decreases with education. Also, political tolerance is associated with musical tolerance, even controlling for educational attainment, and racism increases the probability of disliking genres whose fans are disproportionately non-White. Tolerant musical taste, however, is found to have a specific pattern of exclusiveness: Those genres whose fans have the least education--gospel, country, rap, and heavy metal--are also those most likely to be rejected by the musically tolerant. Broad familiarity with music genres is also significantly related to education. I suggest, therefore, that cultural tolerance constitutes multicultural capital as it is unevenly distributed in the population and evidences class-based exclusion.

This framework helps to integrate findings of consumption surveys and to explain the emergence of new artistic genres as a form of ritual classification. Societies' artistic classification systems vary along four dimensions: differentiation, hierarchy, universality, and boundary strength. These dimensions are affected by formal characteristics of social structure, the organization of educational systems, and internal relations among cultural dimensions. The dynamics of ritual classification are mediated according to whether artistic production is carried out through commercial, professional, or bureaucratic means.

Conceptual and methodological difficulties of these approaches are discussed, paying particular attention to a major study that has attempted to provide clear empirical support for the correspondence theory using systematic comparative-historical evidence. The paper re-examines the theoretical and empirical adequacy of Swanson's study of the Protestant Reformation and proposes an alternative perspective on the relation between state structures and ideological outcomes. A comparison of sixteenth-century England and France is presented which indicates that the structure of state power in each fails to conform to Swanson's characterization. The utility of taking a social structural approach that emphasizes the manner in which distributions of social resources affect the likelihood of ideological movements becoming institutionalized is suggested. In the case of the Reformation it appears that a decisive factor was the greater degree, than in France, of state autonomy relative to the landed nobility which had been attained in England by the start of the sixteenth century. Some implications of this argument for the study of ideology in other contexts are suggested.

Laub	American Sociological Review	55	5	1990-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 609-627	American Sociological Association	fla		Analyzing the natural histories of two samples of boys that differ dramatically in childhood delinquency, we test a model of crime and deviance over the life course. The first hypothesis is that childhood antisocial behavior predicts problems in adult development across a wide variety of dimensions. Second, we argue that social bonds in adulthood--to work and family--explain changes in crime and deviance over the life span. The longitudinal data were reconstructed from the Gluecks' classic study of delinquent and non-delinquent males from childhood to age 32. Childhood delinquency is linked to adult crime, alcohol abuse, general deviance, economic dependency, educational failure, unemployment, divorce, and even charges in the military. Despite this continuity, job stability and strong marital attachment in adulthood inhibit adult criminal and deviant behavior. The results support a model of informal social control that recognizes both stability and change in antisocial behavior over the life course.

I propose a discrete-time hazard-rate model to explain this novel pattern of labor disorganization. Model estimates indicate that union decline is related to growing economic openness, unemployment, pre-existing levels of unionization, the decentralization of collective bargaining institutions, and the electoral failure of social democratic parties through the 1980s.

It assumes that individuals form judgments about the propriety of reward allocations based upon social comparisons across individuals, groups or standards, and that all such comparisons are potential sources for feelings of injustice and justice-restoring behaviors. When linked with Jasso's (1980) theory of aggregate consequences of individual justice evaluations, we have the capability to investigate theoretically and empirically certain individual- and/or aggregate-level behavior as determined by a small set of individual and/or aggregate properties. Research is reported in which individuals responded to unjust pay allocations in a multi-person, multi-group setting--a simulated organization. Hypotheses derived from the theory were concerned with predicting the relative impact of (1) different degrees of injustice (a logarithmic response function was tested); (2) individual versus collective injustices (conditions under which one or the other should predominate were tested); and (3) different numbers of injustices in a situation (increasing the number of injustices was predicted to decrease the impact of each). All of the hypotheses were supported.

If so, what explains the relationship between organization size and job rewards? We examine these questions using a recent nationally representative data set that provides information on organizations and their employees in the United States. We find that employees in large organizations have higher earnings, more fringe benefits and opportunities for promotion, but less autonomy on the job than do workers employed by small organizations. Our theoretical framework identifies several possible reasons for the relationship between organization size and job rewards, including industrial, geographic, organizational, and individual variables. Whether a firm has internal labor markets is the correlate of organization size most consistently related to job rewards.

Combining insights from power resource theory, mass turmoil theory, and the polity-centered approach, I develop a  state transformation  theory. State transformation theory moves beyond the traditional focus of social movement theories on how the state shapes the outcome of social protest, to consider how social movements affect the process of state formation. I outline state transformations that occurred in the context of conflict between civil rights activists and organized labor over the definition of economic justice. Evidence indicates that deep structural change occurred within the state and suggests that this transformation was legitimated by ideological claims that redefined democratic rights.

Goldstein	American Sociological Review	59	1	1994-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 64-82	American Sociological Association	fla		In 1980, for the first time, the U.S. Census contained a subjective question about ethnic identity. Natural increase, intermarriage, and subjective identification contribute to the current size of each ethnic group. Simulations for the British-, Irish-, German-, and Italian-origin populations show the interaction among time of arrival, overall fertility and mortality trends, and differential fertility in determining natural increase. The subjective identification with some ethnic groups, notably the Irish and Germans, exceeds what natural increase would imply, while identification with other ethnic groups falls short of what demographic processes would imply. Loglinear models of ethno-religious intermarriage show that religious diversity is an important factor in the diffusion of Irish and German identities, while the relative religious homogeneity of the British and Italians limits the diffusion of those identities. The subjective component is a residual in this analysis.

Recent changes in the Brazilian Catholic church, however, provide the opportunity for examining the conditions under which organizational transformation can take a politically radical direction. I argue that the church's radicalization can be understood only by examining the interaction of the organizational value set and elite response to environmental changes. Opportunity for organizational transformation is created by environmental changes, but the form that transformation takes is constrained by the value-defined terms of legitimate discourse. This interplay of opportunity and constraint explains both the transformation of the Brazilian church and the direction of that transformation. To develop this argument, I present a historical analysis of the process of change in Brazil and then reinforce the conclusions from this case study with a comparative analysis of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia.

These reference group processes distort perceptions of class: They make most people think they are middle class, thereby weakening the link between objective class and subjective perceptions of class and class conflict, fostering consensual rather than conflictual views of class relations, and attenuating the links between class and politics, particularly in Central European nations. Maximum-likelihood analyses of large, representative national samples from six Western democracies support the argument.

Clayman	American Sociological Review	58	1	1993-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 110-130	American Sociological Association	fla		Audience booing is a form of collective behavior that emerges within and has consequences for interactions between speaker and audience. Prior research on applause serves as a comparative reference point for an analysis of booing. The principal finding is that applause and booing are coordinated by different mechanics of collective behavior. Applause usually begins promptly and its onset is coordinated primarily by audience members acting independently in response to prominent junctures in a speech. Booing is usually delayed and is coordinated primarily by audience members monitoring each other's conduct so as to respond together. This asymmetry between applause and booing is explained in terms of general structures of interaction as documented in previous research on affiliative and disaffiliative responses in ordinary conversation. Thus, the sequential structure of interaction embodies a robust framework within which particular activities, including collective activities like applause and booing, are managed.

Warner	American Sociological Review	57	3	1992-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 293-305	American Sociological Association	fla		America's largest cities in 1900 were struggling under the effects of industrialization, urbanization, and immigration. Increasing numbers of immigrants presented political, economic, and cultural threats to the hegemony of native-born middle- and upper-class Americans. As a result, nonimmigrant Americans put pressure on the police to clamp down on urban crime, especially crime related to undesirable aspects of the  foreign  community's lifestyle like the consumption of alcohol. We test conflict theory's threat hypothesis in large American cities in 1900 by relating the percent foreign-born and the arrest rate for drunkenness under numerous controls suggested by criminological research. Because the urban politics of the period revolved around battles between city bosses and reformers, we incorporate political variables into the analysis. The results support a political interpretation of the aggressiveness with which urban police made arrests for drunkenness.

Drass	American Sociological Review	61	4	1996-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 614-634	American Sociological Association	fla		Rapid increases in crime in the United States in the 1960s and early 1970s have been puzzling in that they seem to coincide with economic growth and increased educational opportunity for disadvantaged groups, especially African Americans. We argue that these increases in crime may be more understandable in their historical context: Much of the economic expansion during the postwar period and the unprecedented gains in educational attainment for African Americans were accompanied by growing intraracial income inequality. Our annual time-series analysis of African American and White robbery, burglary, and homicide arrest rates from 1957 to 1990 confirms that intraracial income inequality is a consistent predictor of changes in arrest rates for both African Americans and Whites. An interaction analysis of dummy variables indicates that the relationship between education and crime for African Americans and Whites is contingent on levels of intraracial income inequality. For African Americans, increasing educational attainment is associated with rising arrest rates, but only during periods of growing income inequality; for Whites, increasing educational attainment is associated with reduced crime rates, but only during periods of declining inequality.

Lichter	American Sociological Review	56	6	1991-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 801-817	American Sociological Association	fla		The link between family structure and the changing economic well-being of American children since 1960 is examined using child records from the 1960, 1970, and 1980 Public Use Microdata Sample, and from the 1988 March Current Population Survey. We find that: (1) child poverty rates would have been one-third less in 1988 if family structure had not changed since 1960; (2) changing family structure accounted for nearly 50 percent of the increase in child poverty rates since 1980; (3) changing maternal employment patterns placed significant downward pressure on child poverty from 1960 to 1988, but could not prevent the overall rise in child poverty during the 1980s; (4) racial divergence in family structure since 1960 exacerbated the persistent black-white differences in children's economic status; (5) racial differences in parental work patterns since 1960 acted to reduce racial differences in child poverty; and (6) that changing family-size differentials between poor and nonpoor households exerted upward pressure on child poverty rates, especially among whites. Our results reinforce the view that child poverty and racial inequality cannot be separated from the issue of changing family structure in America.

Oliver, Gerald Marwell	American Sociological Review	53	1	1988-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1-8	American Sociological Association	fla		Many sociologists incorrectly believe that larger groups are less likely to support collective action than smaller ones. The effect of group size, in fact, depends on costs. If the costs of collective goods rise with the number who share in them, larger groups act less frequently than smaller ones. If the costs vary little with group size, larger groups should exhibit more collective action than smaller ones because larger groups have more resources and are more likely to have a critical mass of highly interested and resourceful actors. The positive effects of group size increase with group heterogeneity and nonrandom social ties. Paradoxically, when groups are heterogeneous, fewer contributors may be needed to provide a good to larger groups, making collective action less complex and less expensive.

Roy, Philip Bonacich	American Sociological Review	53	3	1988-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 368-379	American Sociological Association	fla		The debate about the separation of ownership and control has focused primarily on internal control of corporations. This study examines the relationship between ownership and control at the interorganizational level. It investigates the relationship between the structure of interorganizational title, as indicated by proprietary communities of interest, and the structure of interorganizational control, as shown by clusters of firms that recruited their boards from the same sets of directors. Secondarily the paper investigates the structure of centrality in the interlocking directorates, for which managerial theory predicts a close relationship between size and centrality. Examining American railroads in 1905, the results show that (1) while ownership and control may or may not have been separate at the level of the individual firm, at the interorganizational level the structure of title conforms very closely to the structure of control; and (2) the structure of centrality exhibits no singular hierarchy, but distinct clusters. Moreover, major companies were not highly central in the entire network, but were instead dominant within particular clusters, suggesting that centralization does not always engender power. The paper concludes that the debate over ownership and control should focus on both organizational and interorganizational levels.

Arguing for the merits of a positive approach, this study formulates specific hypotheses and provides statistical models to demonstrate variation among countries in occupational mobility, using national samples of adult men in the United States, England and Wales, Japan, Hungary, Poland, and Brazil. The results show distinct differences in the mobility patterns of these countries. Moreover, the cross-national variation in relative mobility is neither systematic nor universal.

Issue interests, monitoring resources, and influence reputations are antecedent variables that affect locations in communication and resource exchange networks. These five variables jointly affect the range of core organizations' efforts to influence the outcomes of policy events. Data from the energy and health domains in the 1970s are analyzed with the LISREL program and parameter coefficients are compared across the two domains. Material resource endowments have no direct impact, but issue interests are strongly related to the institutional range of policy events in which organizations are active. In the turbulent and uncertain energy domain, no other structural factors are important, but in the placid and institutionalized health domain, advantageous locations in both the routine communication and resource exchange networks contribute to greater participation in policy events. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the social organization of State policymaking systems.

The middle-class employment that arises in this ecology is distinct from the middle class of majority groups. It is composed of many community service positions and few positions in management and goods production. This pattern holds for both blacks in the United States and Catholics in Northern Ireland. The growth of the black middle class during the 1960s and 1970s included an increase in middle-class employment in professions not tied to community service. The patterns of internal stratification and middle-class recruitment within the black and Catholic minority groups are very similar, despite the different historical, economic, and cultural contexts of discrimination in the United States and Northern Ireland.

Owned by the same enterprise, managed by the same team of managers, producing the same products, and using the same technical labor processes, the two factories developed distinctive patterns of shop-floor politics, termed  localistic despotism  and  familial hegemony.  To explain these patterns, I argue that the social organization of local labor markets produces diverse conditions of workers' dependence. The different dependencies determine management's strategies of control, workers' collective practices, and their mutual constructions of workers' gender. This case study leads to critiques and reconstruction of the theory of production politics and the feminist literature on women workers in global factories.

Perceived threat is hypothesized to be a function of economic conditions and of the size of the subordinate group relative to the dominant group. I test the group-threat theory using a multilevel model that combines population data with survey results on attitudes towards immigrants and racial minorities from Eurobarometer Survey 30.  Group threat  explains most of the variation in average prejudice scores across the 12 countries in the sample and has a small but statistically significant effect on the influence of certain individual-level variables on prejudice. These results demonstrate the importance of perceived intergroup threat in the formation of prejudicial attitudes and suggest a re-interpretation of past findings on the relations between individual characteristics and expressions of prejudice.

Rubin	American Sociological Review	54	2	1989-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 197-214	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper extends Perrone's conceptualization of positional power of labor and investigates its impact on three labor outcomes. We conceptualize positional power as embedded in the structural relations among interconnected spheres of production in the economy. We maintain that positional power is a three-dimensional construct. It entails (1) the ability of workers in a given industry to disrupt operations of other industries  upstream  in the production process, (2) the ability to disrupt operations  downstream  in the production process, and (3) the ability to disrupt production locally within their own industry. After developing new measures of these three dimensions from interindustry input-output flow matrices, we estimate the impact of positional power on three labor outcomes: (a) labor's organizational capacity, (b) labor militancy, and (c) labor's economic standing. Our findings suggest that positional power positively influences all three of these dimensions. We discuss the significance of these results for future research.

Demerath III	American Sociological Review	56	4	1991-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 417-431	American Sociological Association	fla		Two themes in the political culture of the United States relate the nation's politics and government to religion. First is the sense of sacredness connected to the polity that is often termed  civil religion.  Second is the institutional  separation of church and state,  often turned into a normative  separate spheres  argument distancing religion from political activity. That these seemingly contradictory themes coexist is evidence for the interpretive openness of American culture. We observe both themes in the public politics of a mid-sized, northeastern city and identify three ways that the tensions between these themes are  resolved,  allowing the themes to coexist and providing cultural resources for those involved in civic politics.

Lehman	American Sociological Review	53	6	1988-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 807-823	American Sociological Association	fla		Metatheory makes sociopolitical analyses of  stability  and  crisis  more empirically and theoretically comprehensive. Multidimensional yet parsimonious presuppositions and models reside at the core of metatheory. Power and viability are political sociology's pivotal presuppositional topics. A multidimensional view of power permits a more valid study of such issues as the interaction of capitalism and the state and the autonomy and transformative potential of the latter. Multidimensional analyses of viability encourage a tiered image of politics in which activity and passivity can coexist and the rejection of the binary interpretation of  stability  and  crisis.  A model of the polity with a minimum of four tiers is presented. The state tier is modeled as a complex organization. An organizational, but  nonmanagerialist,  perspective opposes a monogoaled view of state effectiveness. Moreover, viability is understood as entailing not merely state effectiveness but the efficiency of participation and the legitimacy of institutions as well.

We conclude: (1) In all four countries, the authority boundary is the most permeable to intergenerational mobility; (2) in the two North American countries, the patterns of permeability of class boundaries are broadly consistent with the expectations of neo-Marxist conceptualizations of class--the property boundary is the least permeable, followed by the expertise boundary, and then the authority boundary; (3) in the two Scandinavian countries, especially in Sweden, the property and expertise boundaries do not differ significantly in their degree of permeability; (4) the class boundary between workers and capitalists is less permeable than would be predicted from a strictly additive model of the permeability of the three dimensions of the class structure (property + authority + expertise); and (5) in the United States and Canada, the patterns of class boundary permeability to mobility are similar to the patterns of permeability to friendship and cross-class marriages, while mobility patterns in Norway and Sweden differ from friendship and marriage patterns.

Alexander	American Sociological Review	59	3	1994-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 446-460	American Sociological Association	fla		This is a longitudinal study of the growth in reading comprehension over the first two years of school among a mixed-race random sample of children in Baltimore, Maryland. African-Americans in integrated schools made less progress in reading comprehension in winter when school was in session than did their counterparts in segregated schools. In summers, however, when they were not in school, the African-American children who attended integrated schools gained considerably more than their counterparts who attended segregated schools. White children made about the same progress in reading in integrated and segregated schools in winters and summers, even though the whites in integrated schools came from more educationally advantaged families. Thus, children of both races in integrated schools, who generally came from more educated families, did not make the expected gains in reading comprehension when school was open. In summers, however, students whose parents had more education forged ahead of those whose parents were high school dropouts. We consider several explanations for the relatively slow growth in reading comprehension we observed for children in integrated schools. It is most likely that acquisition of reading skills is harder for youngsters of both races in integrated schools because their language backgrounds differ. Early reading development depends heavily on a child's knowledge of spoken language, which for Baltimore children reflects their experience in segregated neighborhoods. At the same time, schools seem to help the children from economically disadvantaged homes--the ones who need help the most.

Walder	American Sociological Review	57	4	1992-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 524-539	American Sociological Association	fla		In socialist economies, work organizations differ widely in the compensation they provide employees, despite the absence of key product and labor market processes thought to explain such inequalities in market economies. Existing theories of stratification in socialist economies focus on the power and privilege of elites, but inequalities among organizations are not created by political particularism or elite power. In this paper I sketch elements of an institutional theory of stratification anchored in a conception of property rights--the right to derive income from productive assets. Two aspects of property rights guide the analysis: (1) the dispersion of property rights across a hierarchy of government jurisdictions, and (2) the exercise of these rights by government jurisdictions as they extract revenues, primarily through taxation. Extraction of revenues from a work organization varies with the budgetary resources of a government jurisdiction and the dependence of that jurisdiction on the outputs of the organization. Variation in revenue extraction, in turn, creates inequalities among work organizations in their abilities to provide benefits to employees. An analysis of survey data on the provision of housing and benefits by work organizations in the large industrial city of Tianjin, China provides provisional support for these ideas.

Civil rights activists scored the highest on four measures of active conventional and unconventional politics. The noninvolved in college politics are the least active as adults. Although both the protesters and the institutional activists are highly involved in politics, they tend to be on opposite sides in various political arenas.

New life history data for four birth cohorts of East German women and men show that, despite this, the gender gap in earnings remained substantial. Throughout the 40-year history of the GDR, women continued to experience a considerable pay disadvantage when entering the work force, and the gap persisted at the end of 1989. The persistence of women's pay disadvantage in a society where gender differences in qualifications and labor force experience had almost disappeared suggests that education and labor force experience were not causes of the gender gap in pay. The inability to explain much of women's lower pay by the sex segregation of broad occupational or industrial categories suggests that the main source of women's pay disadvantage was low pay in the specific jobs occupied by women. This raises the question of why the Socialist Party did not exercise its authority in the centralized economy to adjust pay scales to remove gender-based pay differentials.

A multivariate analysis shows that the effects of ascribed characteristics on the receipt of awards operate indirectly, while employment position and professional achievement have different effects for different types of awards. And for the first time for a Communist society, we demonstrate in the analysis with data from Yugoslavia how membership in the Communist party, participation in the National Liberation Front of World War II, and other political status variables affect formal status recognition. All political status variables strongly affect receipt of honors, even with controls for ascribed, positional, and achievement characteristics. The results demonstrate how the elite of a society use formal honors to reproduce a system of inequality.

This paper explores and contrasts the most blatant forms of active exclusion, which includes genocide, and indirect exclusion, which is characterized by subtle forms of exclusion through social invisibility. In genocide, the targeted groups are not simply excluded from life integrity rights, but offenses against them are explicitly encouraged, rewarded, and sanctioned by the regime. In indirect exclusion, the exclusion is implicit in cultural and institutional practices and is often unintentional. I examine the difficulties and dilemmas involved in resisting and preventing active exclusion and in challenging the cultural codes that maintain indirect exclusion.

The model constrains cross-table variation in the origin-destination association to be the log-multiplicative product of a common association pattern and a table-specific parameter. Like Yamaguchi's (1987) uniform layer effect model, the log-multiplicative layer effect model provides one-parameter tests and thus facilitates analysis of the difference in  vertical mobility  between two mobility tables. Compared to the uniform layer effect model, the log-multiplicative layer effect model is far more flexible in specifying the origin-destination association. Virtually all two-way mobility models can be incorporated into the log-multiplicative layer effect model while retaining their usual interpretability. All that is required is that the tables being compared have a common pattern for the origin-destination association. Properties of the new model are demonstrated using three data sets previously analyzed in comparative mobility research. The same methodology can be generalized to the analysis of multiple two-way contingency tables if the two-way association of primary interest is specified to follow a common pattern, albeit with different levels, across the tables.

These components include differences between mobility tables in (1) the strength of off-diagonal associations, (2) the strength of diagonal effects, and (3) the extent of structural mobility. Most of the models in this paper use association models and the Sobel-Hout-Duncan model but are specifically formulated to analyze three-way tables that have either nations or periods as the third dimension. American, British, and Japanese mobility tables are compared. Together, they show that equality of occupational opportunity is larger for the United States than for Great Britain, that Japan's mobility structure is closer to quasi-independence than that of the two other nations, and that Japan's mobility structure became more like that of the United States in 1975 rather than in 1955. These analyses also demonstrate that comparative mobility research based on indexing mobility has strong limitations.

Link	American Sociological Review	52	1	1987-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 96-112	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper hypothesizes that official labeling gives personal relevance to an individual's beliefs about how others respond to mental patients. According to this view, people develop conceptions of what others think of mental patients long before they become patients. These conceptions include the belief that others devalue and discriminate against mental patients. When people enter psychiatric treatment and are labeled, these beliefs become personally applicable and lead to self-devaluation and/or the fear of rejection by others. Such reactions may have negative effects on both psychological and social functioning. This hypothesis was tested by comparing samples of community residents and psychiatric patients from the Washington Heights section of New York city. Five groups were formed (1) first-treatment contact patients, (2) repeat-treatment contact patients, (3) formerly treated community residents, (4) untreated community cases, and (5) community residents with no evidence of severe psychopathology. These groups were administered a scale that measured beliefs that mental patients would be devalued and discriminated against by most people. Scores on this scale were associated with demoralization, income loss, and unemployment in labeled groups but not in unlabeled groups. The results suggest that labeling may produce negative outcomes like those specified by the classic concept of secondary deviance.

We replicate and compare estimates of the basic model of density-dependent legitimation and competition for Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. The predictions of the model hold for each country. We also seek to clarify processes of legitimation and competition by considering multiple levels of analysis and links between countries. Our main hypothesis is that legitimation operates more broadly than competition. In particular, legitimation is driven by the density of all European automobile producers, while competition is determined by a country's own density of producers. This hypothesis is supported for the four continental countries but not for Britain.

Dohrenwend	American Sociological Review	54	3	1989-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 400-423	American Sociological Association	fla		Critics of labeling theory vigorously dispute Scheff's (1966) provocative etiological hypothesis and downplay the importance of factors such as stigma and stereotyping. We propose a modified labeling perspective which claims that even if labeling does not directly produce mental disorder, it can lead to negative outcomes. Our approach asserts that socialization leads individuals to develop a set of beliefs about how most people treat mental patients. When individuals enter treatment, these beliefs take on new meaning. The more patients believe that they will be devalued and discriminated against, the more they feel threatened by interacting with others. They may keep their treatment a secret, try to educate others about their situation, or withdraw from social contacts that they perceive as potentially rejecting. Such strategies can lead to negative consequences for social support networks, jobs, and self-esteem. We test this modified labeling perspective using samples of patients and untreated community residents, and find that both believe that  most people  will reject mental patients. Additionally, patients endorse strategies of secrecy, withdrawal, and education to cope with the threat they perceive. Finally, patients' social support networks are affected by the extent to which they fear rejection and by the coping responses they adopt to deal with their stigmatized status.

The timing and mechanisms of selection into the educational systems and the links between the educational and occupational structures are used to generate hypotheses concerning the stratification process. A model using multiple indicators of occupation and an effect-proportional score for education indicates that ascription is generally more extensive in the two European countries. Education is more important in allocating men to occupations in Poland and West Germany than in the United States, but some of the differences were not as large as anticipated.

Logan	American Sociological Review	61	5	1996-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 739-758	American Sociological Association	fla		Research on transitional socialist societies has explored trends in income inequality and issues concerning who gains and who loses during market reforms. We find that income inequality in a major Chinese city declined only slightly during the first decade of reform policies; it then increased dramatically in the subsequent five years. Strategic position in the state bureaucracy continues to be an important determinant of income, although connections to the market system are becoming alternate sources of advantage. We interpret these findings in light of the historical and institutional context of urban China.

Briggs	American Sociological Review	58	2	1993-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 163-181	American Sociological Association	fla		We explore the determinants of employment and school enrollment among black children and white children in North Carolina and South Carolina in 1910. Our analysis situates decisions about children's employment and schooling in the context of the family, the local labor market, and the local educational system. Family resources were an important determinant of children's employment, especially for white children, but labor-market opportunities were the main predictors of the type of employment, given that children worked. Net of children's employment status, family resources also affected the likelihood of children's school enrollment. Working in a nonagricultural industry interfered with schooling, whereas working in agriculture did not affect the likelihood of school enrollment. Finally, school enrollment of black children was depressed by a lack of educational opportunities. Racial differences in educational opportunities were a more important determinant of racial inequalities in school enrollment than were racial inequalities in family resources or work opportunities.

Burton, John Higley	American Sociological Review	52	3	1987-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 295-307	American Sociological Association	fla		We examine the elite settlement as a major, yet largely overlooked, form of political change. Elite settlements consist of broad compromises among previously warring elite factions, resulting in political stability and thus providing a necessary precondition for the sustained practice of representative democracy. To identify the common features of elite settlements, we draw upon four historic cases: England in 1688-89, Sweden in 1809, Colombia in 1957-58, and Venezuela in 1958. We conclude by arguing for the extraction of elite settlements from their current embeddedness in such concepts as bourgeois revolutions and democratic transitions, and we advocate greater attention to the elite paradigm in efforts to explain macropolitical outcomes.

The analytical components of voluntaristic action are specified, and its three related meanings discussed. Voluntaristic action is then subdivided into substantive norms and procedural norms, and the latter is worked into a new conceptual framework called societal constitutionalism. This framework rests on a synthesis of concepts from Lon Fuller, Jurgen Habermas and Talcott Parsons. Orienting hypotheses are proposed for empirical research.

The fundamental premise of this theory is that class position, measured in relational rather than more traditional gradational terms, influences white-collar criminal behavior as well as its punishment. Using data collected through interviews with investigators involved in the prosecution of securities violators over a seventeen-year period in Ontario, it is demonstrated that the punishment of white-collar crime is not only a function of class position, but also of the kinds of organized white-collar criminal behavior that certain class positions make possible. This is the first analysis to include data on persons charged under noncriminal as well as criminal statutes, a distinction that proves crucial in understanding the class structure and legal sanctioning of the kind of white-collar crime considered.

Matsueda	American Sociological Review	51	1	1986-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 101-119	American Sociological Association	fla		This study examines the deterrent effect of formal sanctions on criminal behavior. While most research on deterrence assumes a rational-choice model of criminal decision-making, few studies consider all of the major elements of the model. In particular, three critical limitations characterize the empirical literature on deterrence: the failure to establish a causal ordering of sanctions and crime consistent with their temporal ordering; the focus on conventional populations and nonserious criminal acts, which are of less interest to the question of how society controls its members; and the inattention to the return or reward component of the decision-making process. To address these issues, we specify, estimate, and test a rational-choice model of crime on data that were collected on individuals, gathered within a longitudinal design, and derived from three distinct populations of persons at high risk of formal sanction. The results support the reward component of the rational-choice model, but fail to support the cost or deterrent component, as measured by perceived risks of formal sanctions.

Smith	American Sociological Review	55	6	1990-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 827-841	American Sociological Association	fla		The substantial body of sociological research on earnings that has accumulated in recent years begins with the assumption that neoclassical economic analyses of earnings are inadequate because they (1) are not strongly supported by the evidence; (2) rest on several unreasonable assumptions; (3) evade falsifiability by attributing discrepant findings to  market imperfections ; (4) neglect power; and (5) do not recognize the significance of internal labor markets. Some recent  new structuralist  research on earnings claims to remedy these defects and produce a superior and distinctively sociological analysis of earnings. I show that new structuralist research (1) caricatures the neoclassical analysis of earnings; (2) for the most part, simply relabels orthodox economic analyses; and (3) in central respects is not well supported by the evidence.

Maynard	American Sociological Review	61	1	1996-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 109-131	American Sociological Association	fla		Forecasting is a strategy for delivering bad news and is compared to two other strategies, stalling and being blunt. Forecasting provides some warning that bad news is forthcoming without keeping the recipient in a state of indefinite suspense (stalling) or conveying the news abruptly (being blunt). Forecasting appears to be more effective than stalling or being blunt in helping a recipient to  realize  the bad news because it involves the deliverer and recipient in a particular social relation: The deliverer of bad news initiates the telling by giving an advance indication of the bad news to come; this allows the recipient to calculate the news in advance of its final presentation, when the deliverer confirms what the recipient has been led to anticipate. Thus, realization of bad news emerges from intimate collaboration, whereas stalling and being blunt require recipients to apprehend the news in a social vacuum. Exacerbating disruption to recipients' everyday world, stalling and being blunt increase the probability of misapprehension (denying, blaming, taking the situation as a joke, etc.) and thereby inhibit rather than facilitate realization. Realization and lack thereof are features of social psychology; social practices and interactional organization are implicated in individual cognition. My data include more than 100 narratives about the delivery and receipt of bad news.

The metropolitan principals of these organizations faced special problems in monitoring and controlling their own colonial agents. Focusing primarily on the Dutch United East Indies Company and secondarily on its English counterpart, I argue that the network structure of each organization affected the degree to which relationships between patrimonial principals and their agents could serve as a disciplinary device. Dutch decline was imminent when alternative opportunities for private gain, available via the ascending English East India Company, allowed Dutch colonial servants to evade their own patrimonial chain and encouraged its organizational breakdown. Features of network structure determined whether colonial agents saw better alternatives to the official patrimonial hierarchy, when they could act on them, and whether principals could respond.

In this paper, a model of power based on resources in the organization and the environment is specified in order to understand how power shifted between intraorganizational units in the 100 largest U.S. firms between 1919 and 1979. Early in the century, large firms were controlled by entrepreneurs or personnel who came up through manufacturing. In the middle decades, sales and marketing personnel controlled large firms. In the past 25 years, finance personnel have become increasingly dominant. These shifts resulted from changes in the strategy and structure of the organizations, changes in antitrust laws that promoted an increase in product-related and unrelated mergers in the postwar era, and the mimicking of firms in similar environments.

Using multiple indicators, I create a scale measuring how much the social environment within a state endorses equality of opportunity. Using 1980 Census data, I test whether industries with more of their employment in states with environments less supportive of equality exhibit greater race/gender inequality in earnings and in access to good (skilled white-collar) jobs. I find that the more egalitarian the institutional environment, the less the inequality between Black men or Black women and White men. Results on whether the state institutional environment affects inequality between White women and White men are equivocal. Industries with stronger ties to the national institutional environment are more favorable in terms of jobs and earnings for Black men, Black women, and White women, relative to White men. All analyses include controls for group differences in human capital, hours worked, average establishment size, and whether the industry is in the core sector.

It combines longitudinal data for 1970-1980 from census materials with a 1973 questionnaire survey of city planning officials concerning local growth-control policies. Growth controls have only modest effects on subsequent changes in local population, median family income, median rent, and black percentage. We argue that formal policy tools or legislation cannot be accepted as indicating that their stated objectives will be realized. Data on such tools are potentially misleading; research on local growth politics requires more fine-grained information on the balance of forces in the community.

Dwayne Smith	American Sociological Review	53	3	1988-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 407-420	American Sociological Association	fla		Informed by the insights of political economy, this study investigates the often-presumed though empirically elusive relationship between societal economic distress and crime. In a social-indicators model, we argue for including both unemployment and inflation rates as measures of the overall health of the economy. We contend that in the face of these destabilizing economic conditions, government engages in dualistic social control policies. On one hand, it attempts to discourage antisocial behavior via placative forms of control and, on the other, it exercises its deterrent capacities. Using annual time-series data for the period 1948-1985, we employ dynamic modeling techniques to examine these influences on annual fluctuations in rates of homicide, robbery, and burglary. The results yield mixed support for the hypothesized relationships, with the posited model gaining potency as we move from explaining more violent to less violent offenses. Finally, these findings hold when we control for changes in two other theoretically important influences: criminal opportunity and the age structure of the population.

Two theories are supported by the data: the  Yankee-Cowboy  theory of regional political differences among U.S. corporations and the regulatory environment theory, which views the differential relationship to government regulation as a primary determinant of corporate political behavior. No support is found for four other theories of business political partisanship: the core-periphery theory, the inner-circle theory, the managerialist theory, and the domestic-multinational theory. The four disconfirmed theories are all variants of a perspective known as the theory of  corporate liberalism,  which hypothesizes a tendency toward greater liberalism on the part of the more dominant or central corporations in American society.

Contrary to the prediction of the semiproletarianization thesis, dependent capitalist development in South Korea has been accompanied by a swifter, more abrupt, and more intense proletarianization than occurred in 19th and 20th century Europe. The compressed process involves a simultaneous increase in blue-collar and white-collar workers and a rapid feminization of white-collar occupations. Korean workers have not made strong collective responses to proletarianization, largely because of repressive state control of the labor movement and the absence of a strong artisan cultural tradition. But rapid proletarianization has facilitated development of the working-class movement. The specific pattern of Korean industrial transformation and workers' reactions to it have been shaped more strongly by the developmental role of the state than the autonomous activities of capital.

Motivated by the finding that the corporate support of a nonprofit is a function of a firm's reputation among contributions professionals (Galaskiewicz, 1985), this paper examines the structure of these professionals' networks and tests to see if proximity results in two giving officers recognizing and/or thinking well of the same nonprofits in their community. Data were analyzed from a survey of 150 publicly-held business corporations in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area. The more proximate two officers were in the network, the more likely they were to evaluate prospective donees in the same way. Professional associations had an indirect effect on how giving officers evaluated nonprofits in that actors who belonged to the same association were more proximate in the contact network. Highly professionalized contributions staff in different firms tended to recognize the same nonprofits in their task environment, independent of their proximity in the network. Finally, job status had an indirect effect on how staff evaluated nonprofits. Under conditions of environmental uncertainty, or when two officers were not members of the same professional association, job status influenced proximity in the network. Thus job status, professional associations, and proximity in the professional network each in its own way had some effect on the knowledge and evaluations of giving officers in our case study.

The Marxist perspective disagrees, contending that superordinate workers actually lose. When income differentials between Jews and Arabs across local labor markets in Israel are decomposed into  legitimate  and  discriminatory  components, the data lend support for the neo-classical perspective. However, the relationship between market discrimination and the income of superordinates is more complex than perceived by previous work on the topic. On the average, Jewish workers gain from economic discrimination against Arabs. But they do not gain equally. Such discrimination results in increased income inequality among Jewish workers, increasing the income share received by Jewish workers at the upper tail of the income distribution and decreasing the income share received by workers at the lower tail.

Messner	American Sociological Review	54	4	1989-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 597-611	American Sociological Association	fla		This research examines the effects of economic discrimination against social groups on national rates of homicide. Drawing on Peter Blau's macrostructural theory, I hypothesize that nations with intense and pervasive discrimination will exhibit comparatively high levels of homicide, and that the effects of discrimination will exceed those of income inequality. Regression analyses using both INTERPOL and World Health Organization homicide data support both hypotheses. Indicators of economic discrimination against social groups are significantly and positively related to homicide rates despite fairly extensive controls for other theoretically relevant national characteristics. Moreover, the effects for discrimination are consistently stronger than those for income concentration. These results suggest that the structuring of economic inequality on the basis of ascribed characteristics is a particularly important source of lethal violence in contemporary societies.

Tolnay	American Sociological Review	56	1	1991-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 33-45	American Sociological Association	fla		A central thesis in studies of nuptiality is that marriage behavior is strongly influenced by economic conditions because they affect the ease with which independent households can be established by young couples. We contend that a society's stratification system should be included in this general framework. Because access to economic opportunities is typically distributed unevenly in society, economic conditions will not affect the marriage behavior of all groups in the same way. An examination of the timing of marriage among white and black residents of the rural South in 1910 strongly supports our hypotheses. Whites delayed marriage in areas where farmland was expensive and manufacturing employment was available. Farm tenancy clearly facilitated early marriage among blacks, while the price of land and availability of manufacturing opportunities had no effect on the timing of marriage. These findings are interpreted in light of the class and caste distinctions characteristic of the Southern stratification system in the early twentieth century. The central tenets of the opportunity thesis of nuptiality are supported, but we emphasize a need to move beyond consideration of the simple availability of economic opportunities to recognize the additional role of their distribution within society.

While this analysis has implications for the status attainment and human capital perspectives, it also represents a direct test of the resource dilution hypothesis. Analyzing a sample of 3279 subjects from the National Longitudinal Survey of the High School Class of 1972, we estimate the association between the number of siblings and (1) the likelihood of parental support of students in college, (2) the amount of parental contributions, and (3) the proportion of total college costs borne by parents. In all cases, a strong inverse relationship is found. Conversely, large sibship sizes increase the dependence upon funds from extrafamilial sources, such as loans, scholarships, employment, and savings. Effects of birth order, although less pronounced, signify a financial advantage to latter-born children. Moreover, sibship structure affects the likelihood that youths cite financial barriers for not attending college.

Using data from a national sample of Greek high school seniors, we assess a model that cultural capital mediates the relationships of school success with family class position and socioeconomic status. While the analysis finds that both father's class position and family socioeconomic status determine a student's cultural capital, we find no evidence that cultural capital has direct or indirect effects on educational achievement. While reproduction of the social hierarchy in Greece occurs through schooling, student ability and effort are the major mechanisms maintaining and legitimating the process.

Some researchers view participative management as providing an opportunity for workers to exercise increased power based on heightened responsibilities. Other researchers view participative management as management's newest ploy to extract not only labor but also the knowledge of production from workers. I use a model of workplace organizations that combines elements from Blauner's (1964) technology-based model and Edwards's (1979) labor-control model to evaluate workers' experiences of alienation and freedom across different systems of production. Data for the analysis are provided by the population of published English-language workplace ethnographies. The results provide partial support for Blauner's |bigcup-shaped curve of declining then increasing freedom under modern forms of production. Under participative organizations of work, however, positive and meaningful experiences in the workplace do not return to the same levels that they achieved under the craft organization of work. Relations among coworkers evidence less improvement under participative organizations of work than task and management-related aspects of work. This incomplete recovery of the positive experiences of craft production leaves at least some room for less optimistic visions of emergent workplace relations.

The hardships created by these policies have provoked unprecedented protests in debtor countries, ranging from mass demonstrations to organized strikes and riots. We examine variation among Third World debtor countries in the presence and severity of protests against austerity policies. Results show that the principal conditions for the occurrence and severity of austerity protests are overurbanization and involvement of international agencies in domestic political-economic policy. We offer a theoretical interpretation that integrates global and national sources of contemporary political protest in the Third World.

Consequently the identification of people with their nationality was accepted to the neglect of an identity associated with the state as a whole. The expectation that a shared political agenda and the modernization of the society would weaken nationalism as a political force was not met. Instead, economic and political rivalries among the Yugoslav republics intensified nationalist feelings. In the early 1990s Yugoslavia's experiment in building a multinational state was replaced with open hostilities and warfare among the South Slavs. We identify four routes to Yugoslav self-identification and analyze the significance of these using survey data from 1985 and 1989, just prior to the break up of Yugoslavia. Urban residents, the young, those from nationally-mixed parentage, Communist Party members, and persons from minority nationalities in their republic were among those most likely to identify as Yugoslavs. None of these factors, however, proved sufficient to override the centrifugal forces of rising nationalism. Implications for political integration in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union are discussed.

Carruthers	American Sociological Review	53	5	1988-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 661-678	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper reports the results of a cross-sectional analysis of emergency relief, unemployment insurance, and old-age pensions in the 48 American states. It analyzes six outcomes: state emergency-relief expenditures and federal emergency-relief expenditures from 1933 to 1935; the timing of passage of unemployment-compensation legislation; the timing of passage of old-age pension legislation; and the contents of old-age pension and unemployment-compensation legislation. These outcomes represent different dimensions of social policy and are used to appraise three theoretical approaches: economic, democratic politics, and statist explanations. In the analysis, the sample is split into industrialized and nonindustrialized states, in accordance with recent cross-national research on social policy and social spending. Although the results yield some support for all three perspectives, the statist perspective is especially well supported. The findings suggest that the different perspectives are limited in applicability to specific outcomes or samples, or both.

Gould	American Sociological Review	56	6	1991-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 716-729	American Sociological Association	fla		Although sociologists increasingly recognize the importance of networks in social movement mobilization, efforts to understand network factors have been hampered by the operationalization of network factors as individual-level variables. I argue that disaggregating relational data into individual-level counts of social ties obscures the crucial issues of network structure and multiplexity. I analyze data on insurgency in the Paris Commune of 1871 and show that organizational networks and pre-existing informal networks interacted in the mobilization process, even in the final moments of the insurrection. Network autocorrelation models reveal that enlistment patterns in the Paris National Guard created organizational linkages among residential areas that contributed to solidarity in the insurgent effort, but the efficacy of these linkages depended on the presence of informal social ties rooted in Parisian neighborhoods. Thus the role of network factors can only be understood by studying the joint influence of formal and informal social structures on the mobilization process.

An Empirical Comparison of Sectoral and Individualistic Explanations for Aggregate Inequality	David Jacobs	American Sociological Review	50	2	1985-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 166-180	American Sociological Association	fla		Explanations derived from the sectoral perspective in sociology and the human-capital-screening perspectives in economics are used to predict income inequality in the American states. The sectoral perspective is represented by an indicator of the dispersion of concentration in product markets across manufacturing establishments within each state and by the dispersion of employment across enterprises in eight size categories. Individualistic explanations favored by neoclassical economists are operationalized with the dispersion in educational attainments and by the dispersion in the age-experience of the labor force. With the percentage of blacks and three additional variables in the equations, four hypotheses receive consistent support. The strongest determinant of income inequality is the dispersion in educational attainments, but the indicator of concentration is significant in all equations. States with more blacks and greater variance in establishment size also were likely to be comparatively unequal. These results are consistent with both the individualistic emphasis in the neoclassical perspective and the emphasis on economic power in the sectoral perspective. They also indicate that studies of income inequality by human capital economists may have been biased by a failure to control for the institutional variables that are emphasized in sectoral theories.

Solt	American Sociological Review	54	2	1989-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 245-262	American Sociological Association	fla		In this ecological study we show that the particular curvilinear formulation of the relationship between density and the failing rate of organizations proposed by Hannan and Freeman does not hold for the California wine industry between 1940 and 1985. We demonstrate instead that an alternative model focusing on prior foundings and prior failings gives a superior account of the failing rate in this population. We argue that Hannan and Freeman's density-dependent model of organizational mortality systematically overstates the negative effects of illegitimacy on business organizations. We argue further that their model underestimates business organizations' ability to avoid elimination by migrating to neighboring niches and by enlarging their initial niche.

But the state dominated the investment process during World War II, and at war's end it owned 40 percent of the nation's capital assets. This structural transformation offers an ideal opportunity for refining theories of the state. The state's investment policies were influenced by its warmaking agenda and by interagency infighting over the ends and means of state policy. I attempt to reconcile the state's ascendance to international prominence with the confusion and disunity among the agencies that supplied industrial financing. I adapt leading theories of the state--business dominance theory, structuralist Marxism, and state-centered theory--to the middle range by identifying the institutional contexts in which the outcomes asserted by each theory are likely. Business dominance theory offers insights into state subsidy of private financing--an institutional arena in which economic elites were dominant. Structuralist Marxism sheds light on the lending practices of the emergency civilian agency that financed and owned a number of factories. Because the state depended on monopoly sector firms during the war, many of the state's investments represented a capital infusion rather than a threat to private control of the postwar investment process. State-centered theory offers insights when considering the military's direct investments. The military financed and retained ownership of important factories in the nascent military-industrial complex.

Matsueda, Rosemary Gartner, Irving Piliavin, Michael Polakowski	American Sociological Review	57	6	1992-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 752-770	American Sociological Association	fla		We explore the prestige of criminal and conventional occupations using a longitudinal design and ratings from unemployed drug addicts and ex-offenders in seven major metropolitan areas of the United States. These prestige ratings allow us to (1) search for a criminal counterpart to the conventional structure of occupational prestige; (2) examine the relative prestige ratings of criminal and conventional occupations; and (3) assess behavioral hypotheses, derived from theories of criminal subcultures, concerning the relationship between occupational prestige and income from legal and illegal sources. Our respondents rank conventional occupations uniformly higher in prestige than criminal occupations. Moreover, respondents' illegal activities are related to their ratings of the prestige of criminal occupations, but not to their ratings of the prestige of conventional occupations. These results have implications for theories of criminal subcultures.

Conversation, an indicator of fundamental gender differences in behavior, is one area where this theoretical question of gender versus position can be addressed. In this paper, I systematically examine the effects of formal legitimate authority and gender socialization on conversational variables in the context of a relationship between parties of unequal status. I created a simulated organization in the laboratory to study conversations in four types of three-person organizational groups: (1) a female manager with female employees, (2) a female manager with male employees, (3) a male manager with male employees, and (4) a male manager with female employees. I examined both verbal and nonverbal behaviors. Because patterns of conversation may vary depending on the sex of the interactants and the norms of the group context, I also considered the effect of the sex composition of the group. Results of the analysis of verbal behaviors clearly indicate that formal authority is more important than gender in understanding conversation patterns, supporting the situational/authority explanation. Subordinates exhibit more conversational support (i.e., have higher rates of back channeling and positive interruptions, and talk less) than formal leaders and are less directive (i.e., have higher rates of qualifiers), regardless of sex. In contrast, sex composition of the group and gender have a complex effect on the two nonverbal behaviors, smiling and laughing, while formal position has little effect. Gender stereotyped expectations may be stronger for these nonverbal behaviors than for verbal behaviors in an authority context.

(1) First test: If deaths rise after real stories because of the timing of these stories, then deaths should also rise after bogus stories (which fall a year ahead of the real ones) since they exhibit the same timing as the real stories. Using small samples, Baron and Reiss found a rise in deaths after bogus stories. Using larger samples we found no such rise. Baron and Reiss restricted themselves to bogus year-ahead stories, but we also studied bogus year-behind stories (which fall a year behind the real ones). Because bogus behind stories exhibit the same timing as bogus ahead stories, they too should display a rise in deaths. However, no such rise can be found. (2) Second test: If deaths rise after stories because of heteroscedasticity, then these rises should disappear once heteroscedasticity has been removed. However, all findings in Phillips (1983) and Bollen and Phillips (1982) persist after removal of heteroscedasticity. The findings also persist after holiday effects are eliminated. The above tests show that the artifact hypothesis is extremely implausible.

Land	American Sociological Review	50	3	1985-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 317-332	American Sociological Association	fla		Using annual time-series data for the United States, 1946-1982, two hypotheses are tested: (1) The level of the unemployment rate in any given year will have a negative partial contemporaneous effect on detrended fluctuations (increases or decreases) in seven Index Crime rates (homicide, rape, aggravated assault, robbery, burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft) in that year. (2) Unemployment-rate fluctuations from one year to the next will have a positive partial effect on detrended crime-rate fluctuations in the next year. These hypotheses are developed from a theoretical model that identifies the former with a criminal opportunity effect, and the latter with a criminal motivation effect, of aggregate unemployment on crime. For burglary, robbery and larceny-theft, empirical support is found for the expected pattern of partial effects. However, the relative sizes of the effects are such that the total impacts of unemployment-through both partial effects-are negative. In addition, only the negative-levels effect is exhibited for homicide and motor vehicle theft, while rape and aggravated assault show no consistent association with either levels or fluctuations in the unemployment rate. Interpretations for these findings are discussed.

Bradshaw	American Sociological Review	50	2	1985-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 195-207	American Sociological Association	fla		Previous quantitative, cross-national analyses have generally failed to support world-system and dependency arguments when only black African nations are included in the sample. These results are difficult to explain because black Africa is considered a peripheral region of the international division of labor. This paper reexamines the potential effects of economic dependency on black Africa and finds that these nations are undergoing a process of dependent development. According to dependent-development arguments, multinational corporations form an alliance with peripheral (especially state) elites to promote both economic growth and modern-sector development in poor countries. Such growth and development tends to exacerbate economic and political inequality within peripheral areas, which, in turn, produces conflict and turmoil directed against the elite-dominated national state. The analysis presented here supports these arguments in three ways: (1) Direct, private foreign investment facilitates expansion of the state in black Africa; (2) expansion of the state promotes both economic growth and development of the modern sector of the economy; and (3) expansion of the state induces internal strife or domestic turmoil.

Less obvious are improvements in the quality of data collection, conceptualization and measurement, or the ignoring of data gaps. Nor has the quality of our training or our students improved. The result is an increasing communication gap and failure of practices to keep pace with the technical literature. A case for quantification is made. Ideally, hidden assumptions are made explicit, common sense can be clarified and refined, systematic search procedures developed, intractable problems located, and new theoretical insights obtained. But there are disciplinary obstacles to improving training, increasing the quality of graduate students, improving editorial policies, and promoting on the basis of quality rather than quantity of publications. We need to face this quality problem head on.

Koput	American Sociological Review	56	3	1991-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 399-409	American Sociological Association	fla		Recent research in the population ecology of organizations focuses on the density of organizations and their mortality. The central result of these studies is that the mortality rate decreases as organizational density increases, at least up to some density, after which the mortality rate increases. The decreasing part of the mortality rate is attributed to the increasing legitimacy of the organizations as density increases in the early history of the population. The increasing part is attributed to increasing competition among organizations. We claim that the decreasing part of the mortality rate can be explained by a simple, plausible mechanism--unobserved heterogeneity. Since unobserved heterogeneity is pervasive in most data sets, the mortality rate should decrease as the density of organizations increases, at least until competition occurs. In two simulation studies we find unobserved heterogeneity can produce both negative age dependence and negative density dependence. When we control for the previously unobserved variables, these effects are no longer significant. Future investigations of the relationship between legitimation, organizational density, and mortality rates should collect direct measures of legitimation, rather than inferring legitimation from a model.

My focus is on how minorities participate in and rework the central myths of the dominant culture. After viewing a Western film, matched groups of American Indian and Anglo males answered written questionnaires and participated in focus-group interviews. American Indians and Anglos both liked the film, but for different reasons. Indians perceived Westerns as representing a set of values about the land, autonomy, and freedom, while Anglos linked the Western myth to their own history and turned it into an affirmation of the values their ancestors strove for and imposed on the West. These results imply that the meaning imputed to cultural works varies over social space. Lack of data on audience interpretations of cultural products has rendered existing models of the cultural significance of Western films and other genres speculative.

Out attempt to answer this question focuses on the rivalry among the factions and parties involved in organizing American industrial workers from the late 1930s on. We assess how the political practices of the Communists and their rivals determined which political camp won power in the new CIO unions. A logit model shows that two ensembles of political practices  loaded the historical dice  in favor of the Communists. The chances that Communists would win union leadership were far higher: first, if the union had seceded from the AFL and joined the CIO from below, in an insurgent workers' movement, rather than from above, in a revolt of its top officers; and second, if the union had been organized independently, rather than by a CIO  organizing committee.  Two other political practices indirectly favored the Communists: earlier Red union organizing in the industry (although its effects were contradictory); and forming the union as an amalgamated rather than as a unitary organization.

McCarthy, Clark McPhail, Jackie Smith	American Sociological Review	61	3	1996-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 478-499	American Sociological Association	fla		Protest is now central to politics in Western democracies, but it is known to citizens mainly through portrayals in the media. Yet the media cover only a small fraction of public protests, raising the possibility of selection bias. We study this problem by comparing police records of demonstrations in Washington, D.C. in 1982 and 1991 with media coverage of the events in The New York Times, The Washington Post, and on three national television networks. We model the consequences of demonstration form, context, and purpose on the likelihood of media coverage. The estimated size of a demonstration and its importance to the current media issue attention cycle are the strongest predictors of its coverage. Additional analyses support our claim that heightened media attention to an issue increases the likelihood that protests related to that issue will be covered. Comparing 1982 to 1991 suggests that television coverage of protests is increasingly subject to the impact of media issue attention cycles.

Our hypotheses derive from recent research in organizations and social movements; they specify those organizational characteristics likely to be associated with the demise of peace movement organizations (PMO). Using a stratified, national longitudinal sample of PMOs representative of the late 1980s peace movement, we analyze organizational mortality through the use of logistic regression techniques. Consistent with previous research on comparable organizations, smallness, organizational  adolescence,  lack of legitimacy, and lack of threshold levels of organizational structure predict mortality in the population as a whole. However, the determinants of PMO mortality differ substantially by movement domain: The survival of small domain PMOs is associated with those resources that enable them to carve out a broadly focused issue niche and establish themselves in community networks. The survival of large domain PMOs is associated with factors that enable them to elicit and maintain broad-based support from a localized resource base. National PMOs are less likely to disband; having a broad peace focus and avoiding delegitimating public affiliations enhance their survival.

Analysis confirms recent findings that the high incidence among African-Americans of single parenthood and children residing without their parents is not a recent phenomenon. From 1880 through 1960, black children were two to three times more likely to reside without one or both parents than were white children. In recent years, however, the race differential in parental absence has grown. Also, blacks have had a consistently higher percentage of extended households than have whites, but until 1940 this was the result of single parenthood and parentlessness among children: Extended households were more common among whites once the effects of absent parents were controlled.

Using the characteristics of the Nigerian village novel and the literary system underlying this genre, I show how a common picture of African rural life before and after the colonial encounter has been molded by the exigencies of literary production. A popular remnant of social science's old tradition versus modernity dichotomy, mediated by British publishers acting as gatekeepers for African literature, has developed and sustained a Nigerian literary genre, highly influential in the West, that is at odds with the intentions of most Nigerian authors. The case of the village novel demonstrates the impact of global cultural production systems on aesthetic creation, as well as the interplay between social fictions and literary fictions.

Despite national variation in political, economic, or social structures, primary school curricula are very similar throughout the world. This similarity is not predicted by existing theories.

The nation-state and mass education--promoted by intellectuals and nationbuilders to achieve national progress and social equality--have generated strikingly similar national educational systems and school curricula.

I use individual- and aggregate-level data to examine the association between race differences in the risk of intercourse and selected neighborhood characteristics in a national sample of adolescent women. The impact of neighborhood characteristics on the race difference in sexual activity is posited to be a function of the pervasive racial segregation characterizing housing patterns in the United States. The results suggest that the race difference in the risk of first intercourse reflects race differences in access to economic resources and exposure to successful adult role models. The absence of cross-level race interactions indicates that black and white teenage women respond similarly to structural constraints and opportunities.

Analyzing data for the population of Jewish male students who attended the last grade of primary school during the late '60s, we find very large contextual effects on grades and expectations in the schools which did not group students. In schools which did group, contextual effects on expectations are very small.

South, Glenna Spitze	American Sociological Review	59	3	1994-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 327-347	American Sociological Association	fla		Although much recent research has explored the division of household labor between husbands and wives, few studies have examined housework patterns across marital statuses. This paper uses data from the National Survey of Families and Households to analyze differences in time spent on housework by men and women in six different living situations: never married and living with parents, never married and living independently, cohabiting, married, divorced, and widowed. In all situations, women spend more time than men doing housework, but the gender gap is widest among married persons. The time women spend doing housework is higher among cohabitants than among the never-married, is highest in marriage, and is lower among divorcees and widows. Men's housework time is very similar across both never-married living situations, in cohabitation, and in marriage. However, divorced and widowed men do substantially more housework than any other group of men, and they are especially more likely than their married counterparts to spend more time cooking and cleaning. In addition to gender and marital status, housework time is affected significantly by several indicators of workload (e.g., number of children, home ownership) and time devoted to nonhousehold activities (e.g., paid employment, school enrollment)--most of these variables have greater effects on women's housework time than on men's. An adult son living at home increases women's housework, whereas an adult daughter at home reduces housework for women and men. These housework patterns are generally consistent with an emerging perspective that views housework as a symbolic enactment of gender relations. We discuss the implications of these findings for perceptions of marital equity.

Logit regression analysis indicates cadres (officials) have no greater odds than other households of being among the privileged or avoiding poverty. Entrepreneurs and former team cadres, however, are advantaged. Despite the rise of a hybrid elite of entrepreneurs who are currently cadres that capitalizes on redistributive power to gain competitive advantage in the marketplace, increases in income inequality are modest. When market reform stimulates improved economic performance, the poor appear to benefit and experience comparable improvements in household income. As a result, there is only a slight increase in inequality, at least in the early stages of market reform. The empirical analysis is based on survey data collected in rural China in 1985.

Stahura	American Sociological Review	52	2	1987-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 268-277	American Sociological Association	fla		An evaluation of three models of suburban socioeconomic change--the life cycle, persistence, and stratification models--is made for post-World War II decades. The basic thesis is that as metropolitan and fringe growth decline from the peak growth of the 1950s to the reduced growth of the 1970s, decade-specific models of suburban status change will reflect increasing status persistence. A second thesis is that government (operationalized as formal leadership accessibility and functional scope) plays a role in the status change process. Three status measures are examined: median income, percent white collar, and percent completing high school. All U.S. suburbs greater than ten thousand in population in 1950, 1960, and 1970 constitute the sample. The findings show that in every decade the lifecycle, persistence, and stratification models of status change were all empirically supported to some degree. However, during the 1970s, population growth disappeared as a determinant of status change. Moreover, suburban functional scope influenced status change indirectly through population growth.

The relationship of mortality differentials to economic development, socioeconomic stratification, rice cultivation, and region is also examined. Results suggest that kinship structures and female labor force participation are important factors in gender differences in child mortality and these factors reinforce each other to produce especially high sex differentials in mortality. While agricultural, industrial, and urban development appear to reduce the relative survival of girls, male literacy levels seem unrelated to female survival. Rice cultivation consistently enhances female survival. Gender differences in child mortality between the North and South regions of India remain unexplained.

The Prussian tax system was one of the most efficient in early modern Europe. Scholars have argued that (1) the Prussian tax administration was highly bureaucratic, and (2) its efficiency was due primarily to its bureaucratic characteristics. We challenge both propositions. We show that the Prussian tax system deviated from the bureaucratic ideal type in important respects. We then develop general propositions about the conditions under which bureaucratic forms of recruitment, monitoring, and sanctioning are more efficient than alternative forms of agency. We conclude that the efficiency of the Prussian tax collection system was caused by specific deviations from the ideal-typical bureaucracy that increased the ability of rulers to control tax officials.

There are six main empirical conclusions. First, there is considerable cross-national variation in the gender gap in authority: The gap is lowest in the four English-speaking countries (especially the United States and Australia) and highest in Japan. Second, the gender gap in authority within countries and the pattern of cross-national variation do not appear to be the result of gender differences in personal attributes or employment settings. Third, the self-selection hypothesis (that women choose not to seek authority because of family responsibilities) does not appear to account for much of the gender gap in authority, except perhaps in Canada. Fourth, we find little support for the  glass-ceiling  hypothesis that barriers to upward promotions for women in authority hierarchies are greater than the barriers they face in getting into hierarchies in the first place. Fifth, in the United States the barriers faced by women already in hierarchies are weaker than in other countries, and probably weaker than the barriers they faced to enter hierarchies in the first place. Finally, we find suggestive evidence that these variations across countries in the gender gap in authority are explained by the interaction between the availability of managerial positions and the capacity of politically organized women's movements to challenge barriers to women gaining authority in the workplace.

Robinson	American Sociological Review	56	1	1991-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 72-84	American Sociological Association	fla		A model explaining consciousness of gender inequality is tested using data for the United States, Great Britain, West Germany, and Austria. Well-educated people tend to be less favorable toward efforts to reduce gender inequality than less well-educated people. Women with employed husbands are less supportive of efforts to reduce gender inequality than women without a male wage earner. Women are more likely to perceive gender inequality than men and are more supportive of efforts to combat gender inequality. These findings differ from findings in prior U.S. research. Moreover, U.S. women are unique in several respects, including a positive influence of labor force participation on support for efforts to reduce gender inequality. Our findings call into question the generalizability of U.S. studies.

Jones	American Sociological Review	55	2	1990-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 176-190	American Sociological Association	fla		Recent work has called into question the  human relations  interpretation of the evidence from the classic Hawthorne studies, arguing that external factors suffice to explain the variation in workers' output found at the Hawthorne plant. In contrast, this paper demonstrates that, allowing for a wide range of other factors mediated by the social interactions in the working group, workers' productivity levels in the Hawthorne plant were indeed interdependent. Using five years of weekly data from the original Hawthorne studies, a structural model of worker productivity is estimated. This model allows for interdependence of workers' output levels, while recognizing that, although mediated by small group interactions, external and experimental variables can also play a role. The results reveal the joint importance of external factors and worker interaction in affecting the level and variability of output. The human relations approach to industrial sociology is not controverted by the original Hawthorne data from which it began.

The analyses are based on data from the Luxembourg Income Study, which includes data from the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, West Germany, Sweden, Italy, and the Netherlands. We examine the importance of the gender-specific demographic compositions of marriage, parenthood, and employment in accounting for differences in men's and women's poverty rates, both within and across countries. The cross-national comparisons suggest that the relative importance of demographic characteristics differs by country and that factors such as religion, culture, and government policies also help determine the gap between women's and men's poverty rates.

Blacks were more than twice as likely to be fired, after controlling for human capital variables, job tenure, detailed job title, union protection, absenteeism, and incidence of accidents, injuries, and disciplinary actions. That black postal workers in a large north-eastern city were more likely to be fired than their white counterparts suggests that racial differentials in job dismissals are at least as great in the private sector. A theory of job dismissals should consider employer practices as well as worker characteristics.

Lloyd	American Sociological Review	60	1	1995-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 104-125	American Sociological Association	fla		We examine the social distribution of exposure to stress to test the hypothesis that differences in stress exposure are one factor in sociodemographic variations in mental health. We make a more comprehensive effort to estimate stress exposure than has been typical, and present data that challenge the prevailing view that differences in exposure to stress are of only minimal significance for understanding variations in mental health. We report several findings, principal among which are: Differences in exposure to stress account for substantially more variability in depressive symptoms and major depressive disorder than previous reports have suggested; the distributions of stress exposure across sex, age, marital status, and occupational status precisely correspond to the distributions of depressive symptoms and major depressive disorder across the same factors; and differences in exposure to stress alone account for between 23 and 50 percent of observed differences in mental health by sex, marital status, and occupation. These findings contrast with the prevailing view that differences in vulnerability to stress across social statuses account for social status variations in mental health.

Neidert, Reynolds Farley	American Sociological Review	50	6	1985-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 840-850	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper uses a new data source to investigate differences in occupational achievement among a large number of ethnic groups. The November, 1979 Current Population Survey is a unique source since it provides information on both the ancestry and nativity of a large national sample of respondents. These data are particularly valuable because they permit the identification of first-, second- and third- or higher- generation individuals, thereby providing a clearer picture of the process of assimilation. We focus upon the achievements of men, age 20 to 64, classified simultaneously by nativity and ethnicity. Not surprisingly, there are notable differences in the occupational attainment of foreign- born men. Some of these differences are due to the diverse social and economic backgrounds of the different nationalities, but important differences in the rates of return to background characteristics are also evident. The assimilation perspective predicts that eventually ethnic background will no longer be an important determinant of socioeconomic achievement. By the third generation, we find this to be true for the most part, although important exceptions are discussed in this paper.

Analysis of systemic uncertainties and the organizational responses of workers and managers yields a comparative model of mirrored opposition: in economies in which the firm operates in a market environment, systemic uncertainties regarding labor are reduced through internal bureaucratic rules operating according to a classificatory logic. In the socialist economy, by contrast, where systemic uncertainties are produced by a bureaucratic environment, the firm responds through internal market transactions based on affiliative ties. The market-like character of these internal mechanisms is brought into even sharper relief in an analysis of the recent establishment in Hungary of semi-autonomous subcontracting units inside the enterprise.

Soule	American Sociological Review	51	3	1986-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 295-309	American Sociological Association	fla		In the early 1970s the federal government mandated intensified efforts to further the upward mobility of lower-level employees in the federal civil service. This paper examines the consequences of this effort for the careers of minorities and women, in particular, and lower-level employees in general, for an agency of the federal government. A greater proportion of upper-level entry-grade positions were filled by promotion after the implementation of these programs. This growth cannot be explained away by supply/demand effects. Because 90 percent of lower-level employees were women and 50 percent were non-white, the greater proportion of upper-level positions filled through promotion of lower-level employees benefitted these groups, though the benefits of higher promotion rates for non-whites were offset by other factors. However, female and non-white lower-level employees did not have a greater probability for promotion than did male and white lower-level employees, respectively, when other factors were controlled for. The implications of the statistical findings are discussed, and an interpretation is given of how upward mobility programs fit within the overall personnel policy of the federal government.

Jackson	American Sociological Review	53	2	1988-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 284-293	American Sociological Association	fla		We propose gender-specific models of class identification based on the distinctive work and occupational experiences of men and women. Using data from the General Social Surveys of the National Opinion Research Center on white married men and women who were employed full time in 1973, 1974, 1976, 1977, and 1980, regression analysis supports our contention that processes of class identification are gender-specific. Men's class identification is predicted by whether they do manual or nonmanual work and by their position in a supervisory hierarchy. Women's is predicted by self-employment, work in a female occupation, and union membership.

Rubin	American Sociological Review	51	5	1986-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 618-633	American Sociological Association	fla		A major characteristic of class relations in the United States has been the absence of a self consciously defined and politically cohesive working class. The major form of working-class organization has been trade union organization. Unions were institutionalized during the immediate post-war period with the establishment of a post-war labor capital accord, a major function of which was the institutionalization and narrowing of class conflict along narrow economic dimensions. This paper shows that it is the institutionalized presence of the labor movement that empowers worker militancy and allows workers to strike successfully for higher compensation. Using multivariate time-series regression analysis this paper shows that in times (post-World War II) and industrial sectors in which unions are well established, strikes lead to an increased rate of compensation growth. In the post-war period, in the industrial sectors in which unions are not well institutionalized, strikes are an ineffective weapon in economic class struggles and unionization appears to be economically beneficial.

Cross-classifying two variables--the stability of political alignments and the opportunities for autonomous action within the polity--yields four types of political structures; each is particularly conducive to different  master frames  (antisystem, inclusion, revitalization, and realignment). This approach also improves specification of the role of organizational resources. These resources become substantially more effective if the strategies they are supposed to support are framed in a way consistent with the master frame and the opportunity structure.

Dixon	American Sociological Review	58	5	1993-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 681-702	American Sociological Association	fla		Despite extensive criticism, Marx's theory of rebellion has not been analyzed directly in cross-national research. The failure of proletarian revolutions to occur in the most developed countries has discredited Marx's predictions. Recent cross-national studies of rebellion and political violence have discovered a perplexing positive effect of economic development on rebellion, net of income inequality and political democracy. We show that a proper understanding of Marx's theory can explain this finding. Economic development fosters revolt because of its impact on proletarianization and class exploitation. We offer a Marxist interpretation of rebellion research and develop a novel measure of class exploitation in a cross-national regression analysis of violent rebellion in 61 countries. Our results conform to Marx's expectation that the effect of class exploitation on revolt is conditioned by market crises. Although some findings are consistent with alternative theories, we suggest that the findings provide new empirical support for Marx's insights.

We identify two routes to nonparticipation-- nonconversion  and  erosion.  Nonconversion refers to a movement's failure to transform sympathizers into active participants. Erosion refers to the loss of sympathizers. We provide a theoretical framework for explaining nonconversion and erosion and apply it to a longitudinal study of a mobilization campaign of the Dutch Peace Movement: the People's Petition against cruise missiles. Data came from telephone interviews we conducted among random samples (N = 224) from the populations of four communities before and after the campaign (in May and November 1985). We use binomial logistic regression analyses to test several explanations of nonconversion and erosion. Factors that led to erosion were moderate action preparedness at the beginning of the campaign, declining preparedness during the campaign, and a social environment perceived by participants as becoming less and less supportive. Factors that led to nonconversion were moderate but stable action preparedness combined with the presence of barriers to action and an indifferent social environment. Results are discussed and related to social movement literature.

Houser	American Sociological Review	61	5	1996-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 867-883	American Sociological Association	fla		Individuals' emotional reactions may play a role in the development and maintenance of status hierarchies in groups. We propose that emotional reactions compatible with status characteristics reduce status differences among group members, while incompatible emotional reactions increase status differences. We test our theory in four experiments using a variety of techniques. Results from all experiments support the theory. In Study 1, members of face-to-face groups were randomly assigned the position of leader, and they reported more positive emotion after group interaction than did other group members. Studies 2, 3, and 4 used a more controlled laboratory setting to show that participants' negative emotion increased their resistance to a partner's influence. Positive emotion decreased resistance. Also, effects of emotions combined with effects of status information as predicted; this result suggests the possibility of beneficial interventions in work groups.

Employing Jewish emigration rates from Israel as a measure of social (dis)integration, I test the effects of two aspects of the Israeli-Arab conflict on emigration rates during 1951-1984: (1) annual military reserve duty and (2) subjective intensity of the conflict or its salience as reflected in the media. These two aspects are hypothesized to affect emigration rates through different mechanisms. Reserve duty constitutes a heavy cost to the individual, which directly affects the majority of Israeli households. It is expected to increase emigration rates by increasing individual costs of living in Israel. Increased salience of the conflict, on the other hand, is likely to attenuate emigration rates via social mechanisms that enhance social cohesion and integration. Results support arguments for opposite effects of the two aspects of conflict on emigration rates.

Brinton	American Sociological Review	54	4	1989-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 549-564	American Sociological Association	fla		Japanese women participate in the labor force at rates similar to women in Western industrial nations, but gender stratification patterns are sharper. Women in Japan are less apt to work as employees, a tendency that increases with age. Likewise, female employees tend to shift from larger to smaller firms across the life cycle, whereas male employees do not. These aggregate patterns imply that Japanese women are seldom placed in career-track positions in large firms early in their careers. Analyses on labor market entry data from the 1984  Survey on Work Patterns  substantiate this view. Although Japanese men and women enter large firms at equivalent rates upon leaving school, 22 percent of men and only 7 percent of women enter career ladders. The majority of women enter large firms as clerical workers, three-quarters of whom are in low-level  assistant clerical  positions. Causal processes governing entrance to large firms and career tracks are examined in the paper, with particular attention to the relative returns to different levels and types of education for Japanese men and women.

Lerner	American Sociological Review	50	5	1985-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 659-676	American Sociological Association	fla		Linking biographical, social and historical change is a long-standing objective within social psychology. Life-span research on human development, socialization and aging is renewing this tradition across the behavioral sciences under a different rubric-life course and life-span research. As yet, there is no internally consistent, interdisciplinary framework of concepts about developmental change in individuals and in organizational and cultural contexts that might guide the multi-level, multi-disciplinary study of these relationships. We suggest that a metatheoretical perspective, developmental contextualism, may provide an integrating framework. We note that recent controversies in psychology and sociology over definitions of development and the relative importance of ontogeny and socialization have neglected to model processes of biological, psychological and sociocultural change as interacting and leading to probabilistic rather than deterministic outcomes in a population. Based in developmental contextualism, we offer a model of human development as a person-population process. We present a method for distinguishing between behavioral change in general and probabilistic development over the lifespan, using duration-dependent rates of change as a necessary but not sufficient criterion. We identify different contexts of duration dependence, based on various forms of time-graded transitions: age grades, event grades, and history grades.

From this perspective, social stress results from interruption of the feedback loop that maintains identity processes. I discuss four mechanisms of interruption of identity processes: broken identity loops, interference between identity systems, over-controlled identity systems, and the invocation of episodic identities. Each of these four mechanisms is associated with conditions known to produce feelings of distress. Finally, I discuss how personal evaluation relates to identity processes and distress, and how distress, can lead to changes in identity.

Interaction is conceptualized in terms of a sexual division of labor wherein men dominate conversation and women behave in a supportive manner. The literature raises the question of whether these differences in conversational patterns are tied to power as well as sex. A study was designed to determine which of a set of variables reflecting conversational duties and privileges are linked to power, to sex, or to both. The data were coded from interactions of intimate couples divided among those with both partners sharing power equally and those where one partner has more power. Three types of couples were compared: cross-sex couples, male couples, and female couples. Interruptions and back channels are linked to power regardless of the sex of the actor, as are tag questions, although the rarity of their occurrence makes any conclusions tentative. The more powerful person interrupts his or her partner more and produces lower rates of back channels and tag questions. Talking time and question asking seemed linked to both sex and power, though not in any simple way. The results of the analyses of minimal responses and overlaps proved inconclusive.

A randomized field experiment in Dade County was designed to test the relative effectiveness of different police responses to incidents of spouse abuse. We test whether the deterrent effect of arrest interacts with the informal sanctions implied by employment status and marital status. The results indicate that, overall, formal arrest has no effect on occurrence of a subsequent assault. This overall lack of effect masks two offsetting effects: Arrest has a statistically significant deterrent effect among employed suspects, whereas arrest leads to a significant increase in subsequent assaults among unemployed suspects. The interaction effect between arrest and employment status was also statistically significant. There were no significant effects associated with marital status. The interaction effect between arrest and a composite measure of  commitment  based on both employment and marital status was also statistically significant.

Stahura	American Sociological Review	51	1	1986-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 131-144	American Sociological Association	fla		Structural models of suburban development and black population growth are developed for each of the post World War II decades. Changes in the determinants (region, age, distance to the central city, socioeconomic status, area, job concentration and population size) of black growth across the post-war decades are examined within the context of changing black--white relations. In addition, the reciprocal issue of change in the effect of black suburbanization on suburban development (population, job and areal growth) is examined. The basic thesis is that change in the process of black suburbanization has occurred during the post war decades in response to the changing Civil Rights climate. Maximum likelihood model estimates are generated for each decade using samples of all suburbs which had at least 10,000 population during each decade. The analysis shows that the determinants of black growth and the role of black suburbanization in suburban development have changed across the decades.

Douglas Willms	American Sociological Review	51	2	1986-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 224-241	American Sociological Association	fla		In 1965 Scotland began to reorganize its secondary education along comprehensive lines by abolishing selective transfer to secondary school. Ten years later the process was substantially completed. This study describes the socioeconomic composition of Scotland's school towards the end of the 1970s and examines the relationship between school composition and pupils' grades and attainment in the Scottish Certificate of Education examinations. The study employs data from the 1981 Scottish School Leavers' Survey, which surveyed a large representative sample of pupils that left school in 1980. The analysis provides estimates of socioeconomic status (SES) segregation for each of Scotland's administrative divisions, and employs multilevel regression analyses to estimate the contextual effects of school mean SES on examination results. The findings show that there is large between-school variation in SES in most school divisions, and that much of this variation is associated with an unequal distribution of pupils from high-social-class backgrounds. The findings also suggest that there are substantial contextual effects of school mean SES on examination attainment, that they are more strongly related to the proportion of high-social-class pupils in a school than the proportion of low-social-class pupils, and that they are equally strong for pupils of high and low ability alike.

The analysis demonstrates that the social construction of such subjective information makes its use in comparative analysis problematic since both its  accuracy  and the outcome for which it is employed as a predictor are influenced by the respondent's culture and social location. We argue that subjective information is socially and culturally constructed and, by definition, endogenous in models in which self-reports are used as predictors. Methodologically, this requires that the endogenous status of subjective information be explicitly modeled when it is used as a predictor in structural models. As an illustration of the substantive consequences of group-specific response patterns, we examine the use of self-reported health status in comparing the health levels of Mexican-Americans, blacks, and non-Hispanic whites.

Building on these two perspectives, we examine the impact of an occupation's external market--the extent to which it offers systematic within-occupation movement among employers--on internal job mobility and protection structures and the availability of grievance procedures. Data from a sample of Chicago workers and their employers confirm aspects of both market and institutional theory. Results also support our core hypothesis, that incumbents of occupations embedded in strong external markets are less likely to have these governance structures available.

McEneaney	American Sociological Review	61	4	1996-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 590-613	American Sociological Association	fla		We test arguments that residential segregation incites racial unrest using event-histories of 154 race riots in 1960 to 1993 in 55 of the largest SMSAs in the United States. We argue that, although racial deprivation and residential segregation may reinforce identification with racial boundaries and awareness of racial grievances, these problems do not alone spark racial conflict. Instead, we find that a combination of high levels of racial segregation followed by interracial contact generates racial competition, which in turn increases the rate of ethnic and racial unrest. Our results show that in SMSAs where residential contact between African Americans and Whites increases, the rate of race riots increases significantly. A prior history of racial turmoil increases the likelihood of another race riot; the results suggest that the rate of race riots in a metropolitan area depends nonmonotonically on the number of previous riots in that region. These effects remain potent in models controlling for population size, income disparity, ethnic diversity, Black poverty rate, unemployment, and minority composition.

Lovaglia, Jeffrey Erger	American Sociological Review	58	2	1993-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 197-209	American Sociological Association	fla		We extend network exchange theory (Markovsky, Willer, and Patton 1988) to accommodate a new class of power phenomena. Previous theory and research have shown that structural configurations in some networks promote or inhibit exchange opportunities, leading to robust power and resource differentials. The extension identifies a structural basis for subtler forms of differentiation. Using computer simulations and laboratory experiments, we show that the degree to which this  weak power  is manifested in resource accumulations is conditioned by local and global network patterns, and by the experience and strategies of actors in the network. Experimental tests corroborate the predicted weak power effects and the consequences of variations in actors' negotiating experiences.

Scheff	American Sociological Review	53	3	1988-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 395-406	American Sociological Association	fla		This article proposes a unitary explanation of social control for normal and rigid conformity. Conformity may arise from the interaction of deference with normal pride and shame; rigid conformity from chain reactions of shame. I show that Darwin, Cooley, and others suggested the same context for pride and shame: self's perception of the evaluation of self by other(s). Their work, which assumes a continuous social monitoring of the self from the standpoint of others, suggests a puzzle: If social monitoring is continuous and causes either pride or shame, why are so few manifestations of either emotion visible in our lives? One possible explanation is that pride and shame usually have very low visibility. I call this the Cooley-Scheff conjecture. Goffman's work on  face  implies this conjecture and Lewis's discovery of unacknowledged shame confirms it. Her analysis of hundreds of clinical interviews demonstrates that low-visibility shame was present in every session, though neither therapist nor patient seemed to be aware of it. Drawing on Lewis's exact description of the markers of various manifestations of shame and Goffman's analysis of the relation between deference and embarrassment, a deference-emotion system is described. Members perceive this system as compelling conformity to norms exterior to self by informal but pervasive rewards (outer deference and its reciprocal, inner pride) and punishments (lack of deference, and the inner shame that is its reciprocal). I show how Asch's study of conformity and independence illustrates the role of shame in compelling conformity to exterior norms.

Recent research suggests counterintuitive international patterns of occupational sex segregation: low levels of segregation in some traditional countries like Japan and Italy, and high levels in the  progressive  countries of Scandinavia. I argue that the same economic structures that are associated with women's greater integration into the formal labor force also contributes to a deepening institutionalization of gender within the occupational structure. This may occur through the incorporation of women's traditional tasks into the formal economy, and/or through the hierarchical and functional differentiation of economic activity in highly industrial societies. Results indicate that some primary structural characteristics of modern economies (a relatively large service sector and a large employee class) are associated with greater female concentration in clerical, sales, and service occupations. However, other social and cultural characteristics of these countries--low rates of fertility and more favorable ideological environments--partially offset these segregative forces. Furthermore, the actual penetration of egalitarian principles into the labor market appears to be mediated by the structure of interest articulation, with corporatist systems showing greater propensity toward segregation.

Raftery	American Sociological Review	58	1	1993-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 97-109	American Sociological Association	fla		The experience of family disruption during childhood substantially increases men's odds of ending up in the lowest occupational stratum as opposed to the highest. Family disruption also weakens the association between dimensions of men's occupational origins and destinations. The socioeconomic destinations of men from nonintact family backgrounds bear less resemblance to their socioeconomic origins than those of men from intact backgrounds. Men from traditional two-parent homes exhibit a stronger pattern of intergenerational occupational inheritance than do men from disrupted families. These effects are the same for blacks and whites. Recent changes in family structure may lead to greater universalism in contemporary American society.

Power can thus be achieved by insisting that all accounts meet a formal test of literal, objective truth-a test that no account can pass. At stake in the success of such a maneuver is the capacity to control conversation and thereby determine substantive outcomes. Through analysis of Watergate Hearings videotapes, we show how such a power struggle is managed as a moment-to-moment, sequential unfolding of manipulations among interactants. The larger goal is to display the mechanisms through which social process and social structure cohere through interaction.

Our study explores the outcomes of this insurgency and the reasons for its successes and failures. We first review perspectives on success for social protest movements and provide a new definition of success, based on securing collective goods for a beneficiary group through movement organization efforts. Next we elaborate a  political mediation  theory of movement success. This theory holds that to be successful a movement organization must do more than just mobilize supporters and engage in collective action--political conditions must also be favorable to winning new advantages. We then examine historical information about national policymaking in Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal and quantitative data on spending by the Works Progress Administration. To assess the influence of Share Our Wealth, we analyze a secret poll undertaken by the Roosevelt Administration. The historical and quantitative analyses indicate that Share Our Wealth achieved partial success in ways that support the political mediation theory.

Golden	American Sociological Review	51	3	1986-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 430-437	American Sociological Association	fla		Traditional models of suburban employment patterns emphasize continuity in functional differentiation. This results in perpetuation of a pattern in which employing satellites house the greatest concentrations of poor and minority residents, at the highest population density. More recent studies suggest new patterns that result from the competition among even affluent suburbs for tax base, and from the fiscal considerations in locational behavior of firms. For a national sample of suburbs in the period 1960-1980, we find that previous patterns have persisted among suburbs which developed prior to 1950. However, we find a sharp contrast between the correlates of trade and manufacturing employment, and see evidence of a reversal of some key relationships among newer communities.

Killian	American Sociological Review	53	6	1988-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 838-852	American Sociological Association	fla		The  convergence hypothesis  of conventional modernization theory suggests that the nations of the world are becoming more similar. Critics have argued that nations are diverging and becoming dissimilar over time. This paper brings unique data, analytic procedures, and a world-system perspective to bear on this debate. We suggest that world-system theory provides a framework for explaining the simultaneous occurrence of both convergence and divergence. Specifically, the logic of world-system theory suggests that divergence occurs between the three zones of nations (core, semiperiphery, and periphery), whereas convergence occurs within them. With respect to economic development, our analyses indicate that predictions concerning divergence were partially supported and predictions concerning convergence held only for the core. Trends within the periphery and semiperiphery question the utility of world-system theory.

I propose business cycle, demographic, and political arguments to explain varying unionization over time. Centralized union movements that engage in corporatist bargaining and union disbursement of unemployment benefits suggest explanations of cross-national variability in unionization. Analysis of annual data for 18 OECD countries from 1950 to 1985 indicates strong positive effects of union centralization and union disbursement of unemployment benefits on unionization. Union centralization also shapes the longitudinal effect of strike activity on unionization while union disbursement of unemployment benefits positively influences longitudinal effects of unemployment and employment growth. Results suggest that labor movements flourish when they establish an institutional control over labor market outcomes beyond wage bargaining. When labor's institutional control is weak, worker militancy may encourage working class organization in trade unions.

Boolean analyses and ancillary historical materials indicate distinct routes to consolidation of social insurance programs. A  Bismarckian  path centers on strategic co-optive responses of patriarchal states and state elites to working-class mobilization. A second path, a  Lib-Lab  route, centers on strategic incorporation of labor parties and/or unions into governing Liberal coalitions. A possible third path involves reforms by Catholic parties governing patriarchal, unitary states confronting working-class challenges. The virtual absence of leftist governments before the Great Depression has challenged claims for major impacts of the working class on welfare-state formation through the 1920s. However, we find that mobilization of the working class was integral to each conjuncture that generated the adoption of social security programs during the 1880-1930 period. Worker mobilization combined with such varied and distinctly state institutions as patriarchal states and Liberal party governments in ways that advanced welfare states.

All four theories--core theory, equidependence theory, exchange-resistance theory, and expected value theory--assume actors rationally pursue self-interests. Three of the theories add social psychological assumptions that place the pursuit of self interest in an interactive context. Predictions of exchange earnings by the four theories are evaluated against data from eight experimental networks, including types of networks not previously studied. These networks vary conditions that affect the chances that a position can be excluded from exchange. We find that when the theories base predictions on a network position's structural potential for exclusion, exchange-resistance theory provides the best fit, but when predictions are based on actual experiences of exclusion, expected value theory fits best. Our discussion focuses on the distinction between the a priori potential for exclusion versus experienced exclusion as factors in the genesis of power.

It needs to be blended with an awareness that geographic coincidence and medieval class conflict were instrumental in allowing strong, bourgeois-dominated towns to emerge from feudalism. This, and the very long-lasting political stalemate between contending forces in the Middle Ages and early modern Europe were the key elements in the development of Western rationality. Proof comes from comparing Europe to other major agrarian civilizations, particularly China. Twentieth-century historical scholarship confirms Weber more than it supports some recent, fashionable sociological theories about the rise of the West such as  world system theory.

Lachenbruch	American Sociological Review	56	2	1991-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 166-178	American Sociological Association	fla		A sociological model for the mental health consequences of social organization is distinguished from a sociomedical model for the social etiology of particular disorders. Both models use stress to explain associations between social placement and disorder. These models are not interchangeable, despite apparent similarities, but researchers frequently apply the sociomedical model to sociological questions. Discrepancies between models are illustrated with survey data collected from a community sample of adults. We demonstrate that gender differences in the impact of stress are disorder-specific and do not indicate general differences between women and men in susceptibility to stress.

Matthew Snipp	American Sociological Review	50	4	1985-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 475-493	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper reviews several neo-Weberian ideas about social class for understanding patterns of men's career mobility. Special attention is devoted to the non-Marxist concepts of social class advocated by Giddens, Sorokin, and Parkin. Further insights are provided by an analysis of data for 20,000 men in the experienced American civilian labor force. The data are fit with a loglinear model and then further analyzed with multidimensional scaling techniques. The data analysis discloses three broad categories of social class that consist of farmers, manual, and nonmanual occupations. The findings also reveal further subdivisions in which professionals and skilled craft occupations form distinct classes within the nonmanual and manual categories. A third, much smaller, subdivision exists between semi-skilled operatives and unskilled laborers. These findings support neo-Weberian social class concepts. These results are also compared with Breiger's (1981) research on intergenerational mobility. This comparison shows that patterns in career mobility reveal a simpler picture of class structure than the eight class categories that Breiger reports for intergenerational mobility. The conceptual implications of these findings are discussed.

We theorize that their relative enthusiasm for corporal punishment reflects the impact of three components of religious ideology: (1) an acceptance of the doctrine of biblical literalism; (2) the conviction that human nature (and hence the nature of young children) is inherently sinful; (3) and the belief that human sin demands punishment. These arguments about the religious roots of support for corporal punishment are evaluated using data from the 1988 General Social Survey. OLS and structural equation models generally confirm our theoretical model. The findings invite further research into the impact of religious factors on parental values and practices.

Krauze	American Sociological Review	52	5	1987-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 598-611	American Sociological Association	fla		In 1975, Featherman, Jones, and Hauser formulated the hypothesis that national patterns of circulation mobility are basically the same, while national patterns of observed mobility differ. This hypothesis has often been tested and generally confirmed by means of multiplicative models. Previous tests have been indirect because the relationship of the circulation-mobility pattern to the underlying circulation-mobility frequencies remained unspecified. Using the linear programming approach, we determine circulation-mobility frequencies. Patterns for both observed and circulation mobility are expressed in terms of proportions, rates, and odd ratios. A re-analysis of data for 16 national samples demonstrates that, across countries, the patterns of circulation mobility are less similar than the patterns of observed mobility. An additional analysis for 22 countries shows that odds ratios computed from circulation-mobility frequencies correlate with macrostructural characteristics of societies. The results provide strong evidence against the tested hypothesis.

Waite	American Sociological Review	56	4	1991-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 551-566	American Sociological Association	fla		We examine the argument that predominantly female occupations attract women because they are relatively easy to combine with family responsibilities. Some traditionally female occupations offer relatively low penalties for labor force withdrawal, but other  female  occupations reduce the costs of employment to mothers by facilitating the combination of worker and mother roles. We test the hypothesis that a woman's response to the characteristics of her occupation and to other factors depends on her preference for employment vs. homemaking over the long run. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, the analysis focuses on the period from the year prior to the first birth through the two years following the birth as the time of maximum conflict between employment and child rearing. We find no effect of occupational sex composition on the likelihood that prospective or recent mothers are employed. Occupational characteristics that raise the cost of labor force withdrawal (high education, wages, and job-specific training) tend to decrease the probability of women's withdrawal from work, as do nonmonetary occupational characteristics. All women respond to the cost of labor force withdrawal, but women with low work commitment also respond to financial pressures and convenience of the work setting.

Johnston	American Sociological Review	61	4	1996-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 635-655	American Sociological Association	fla		We extend the routine activity perspective's situational analysis of crime to individual offending and to a broad range of deviant behaviors. In this view, unstructured socializing with peers in the absence of authority figures presents opportunities for deviance: In the presence of peers, deviant acts will be easier and more rewarding; the absence of authority figures reduces the potential for social control responses to deviance; and the lack of structure leaves time available for deviant behavior. To determine whether individuals who spend more time in unstructured socializing activities engage in deviant behaviors more frequently, we analyzed within-individual changes in routine activities and deviance across five waves of data for a national sample of more than 1,700 18- to 26-year-olds. Participation in these routine activities was strongly associated with criminal behavior, heavy alcohol use, use of marijuana and other illicit drugs, and dangerous driving. Furthermore, routine activities accounted for a substantial portion of the association between these deviant behaviors and age, sex, and socioeconomic status.

Lichter	American Sociological Review	54	3	1989-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 436-446	American Sociological Association	fla		The present study (1) examines changing levels of employment-related hardship among southern nonmetropolitan blacks for 1970-85, (2) compares the employment circumstances of nonmetropolitan black men and women with those of whites and blacks in the metropolitan South and in the North, and (3) assesses the contribution of black deficits in human capital and job characteristics to persistent racial inequality in rural employment adequacy. Data from the March annual demographic files of the Current Population Survey indicate that black employment hardship continues to be felt in nonmetropolitan areas, where two out of every five blacks are without jobs, cannot find a full-time job, or cannot earn enough to raise themselves significantly above poverty thresholds. Employment hardship among nonmetropolitan blacks continues to exceed that of blacks elsewhere, despite the comparatively rapid deterioration in employment conditions for northern and southern metropolitan blacks in the past decade. Finally, racial inequality in nonmetropolitan employment adequacy remains substantial in the 1980s and cannot be explained away by black deficits in human capital or by the disproportionate concentration of blacks in declining industrial sectors or in blue-collar occupations.

This paper examines variations in job title structures across work roles. Analyzing 3,173 job titles in the California civil service system in 1985, we investigate how and why lines of work vary in the proliferation of job categories that differentiate ranks, functions, or particular organizational locations. The statistical analysis underscores the importance of three social forces shaping the division of labor: ascription by race and sex; the power and social standing of occupational groups, especially the professions; and organizational processes of rationalization. Some implications of these results for studies of organizations and social inequality are discussed.

In addition, we elaborate an institutional politics theory of public social provision. This theory proposes that institutional conditions limit public social provision and that reform-oriented regimes and state bureaucrats are the main forces behind social spending. We appraise this theory with a historical analysis of ADC's creation and its development from the Great Depression until after World War II and with multiple regression analyses of state-level variation in the quality of ADC programs. Our results indicate that the institutional politics theory explains much of the historical development of ADC and cross-state variation in ADC programs.

Pomer	American Sociological Review	51	5	1986-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 650-659	American Sociological Association	fla		This study reanalyzes data on the intragenerational mobility of black and white men. The data are from the 1973 Survey of Occupational Changes in a Generation and refer to occupational mobility from 1962 to 1973, a period recognized for the improvement in the position of blacks in the labor market. Applying a segmentation perspective, the study focuses on black and white men initially employed in low-paying occupations. Particular attention is given to the roles of government employment, self-employment, and internal labor markets. Compared with the mobility of whites, black upward mobility is not only less frequent, but also more restricted in range of occupational and industrial destinations. Blacks seldom become managers, and few move from the periphery industrial sector to the low-skill but moderately well-paying positions in the core industrial sector. Blacks within the public sector do have substantial rates of upward mobility to nonmanagerial positions. The findings provide evidence of the importance of structural influences on mobility, and they counter the contention that discrimination against blacks was largely eliminated during the sixties.

Menken, John Bongaarts	American Sociological Review	52	3	1987-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 346-358	American Sociological Association	fla		A longer life means that current cohorts can spend more years as members of a family in the statuses of parent, child, or spouse and in the combination of these statuses that defines the conjugal family. How much has this potential been realized? This question is addressed for the United States through a simulation of demographic conditions in 1800, 1900, 1960, and 1980. Despite declining fertility and higher divorce rates, women in the 1960 and 1980 cohorts spent more years in marriage and as parents than did earlier generations. They also spent more years as children of aged parents. But much of the potential offered by longer life spans has not been achieved. Not only did the number of years in marriage and parental statuses decline between 1960 and 1980, but current cohorts spend a smaller proportion of their adult lives in them. On the basis of these results, we propose some scenarios of the ways that potential increases in the amount of time that people spend in family statuses may provoke social change.

Two classic sociological questions underlie this politically relevant topic: how do societies choose their members? and how do societies allocate scarce benefits? Using the factorial survey pioneered by P. H. Rossi, we obtained from the Commission staff, numerical ratings of the desirability as immigrants of fictitious visa applicants embodying the full range of potentially relevant characteristics discussed in the political arena. Although the ratings were obtained by a number-assignment technique believed to generate a continuous variable, we accommodate the variable's possible ordinality by performing all analyses twice--using both ordinary-least-squares techniques and maximum-likelihood ordered-response techniques. The results are unambiguous: although a lawful and coherent set of rules guides each respondent's ratings, leading to a personal point system for the selection of immigrants, no two staff members' point systems are alike, not even qualitatively. In the complex weave of agreements and disagreements, three conclusions emerge. First, there is unanimous support for granting preference to visa applicants who have a job offer or a United States-citizen sibling. Second, there is severe disagreement by applicant's region of origin. Third, there is a range of disagreement on other attributes, for example, on whether the United States should favor the immigration, ceteris paribus, of older versus younger applicants or of male versus female applicants.

Hunter	American Sociological Review	53	5	1988-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 753-765	American Sociological Association	fla		This research examines skill changes in the occupational structure of entry-level jobs in Canada, circa 1930-80, along with the changing importance of years of formal education as a criterion for occupational allocation. For both men and women, entry-level jobs with high cognitive complexity and verbal-activity requirements appear to have become more common, and those with high gross-motor activity requirements less common. Throughout the period, formal education was an important factor for entry into certain kinds of occupations. Finally, the importance of schooling for occupational access seems to have become more important in recent times.

Land	American Sociological Review	52	2	1987-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 170-183	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper asks whether decreases in the proportion of the U.S. population in high crime-prone ages in recent years have produced decreases in crime rates which correspond approximately, but in an inverse direction, to the increases observed when the baby boomers reached the high crime-prone ages in the 1960s and 1970s. We examine age distributions of arrests for murder and motor vehicle theft and then specify and estimate structural-equation models of the time trajectories in annual rates of these crimes for the post-World War II period. With these models, we test the hypothesis that the relationship of crime to age composition is symmetric and infer that it cannot be rejected. We also find that simple models that contain effects of trends in the age structure, business cycles, trends in criminal opportunity, and the rate of imprisonment can account for most of the variance in annual rates of homicide and motor vehicle theft from 1946 through 1984. We discuss some implications of our findings for forecasting U.S. crime rates for the remainder of this century and for theories of the macrodynamics of crime causation.

This paper offers a network-exchange theory to solve this problem. Previous research has shown that the nature and outcomes of negotiations among individual or corporate actors can be inferred from their network positions. The impact of this research has been limited because its theory does not enable the researcher to locate power positions in the networks. We offer a theory that is both consistent with all previously reported experimental research and is generalized to conditions not considered by other formulations. In addition to supporting derived hypotheses pertaining to network-based power, our experiments demonstrate, among other things, that certain unstable networks break down to form stable substructures and that some networks contain overlapping but autonomous domains of power and exchange.

Tinsley	American Sociological Review	59	4	1994-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 547-570	American Sociological Association	fla		In 1980, the conglomerate firm, a firm composed of several unrelated businesses, was perhaps the dominant corporate form in the United States. Yet, by 1990 this form had in effect become deinstitutionalized. Using comprehensive time-series data from the 1980s on a population of the largest industrial firms in the United States, we demonstrate that this deinstitutionalization was effected by two processes: First, diversified firms were taken over at a high rate and their unwanted parts were typically sold off, and second, the less diversified firms that survived shunned the strategy of conglomerate growth. The aggregate result was that by 1990 the largest industrial firms in the United States became considerably less diversified. Business rhetoric tracked the shift in this prevalent organizational form and practice by denouncing the  firm-as-portfolio  model in favor of a network model of regularized economic exchange. We argue that an unintended consequence of the successful spread of the conglomerate form was to replace the conceptualization of the corporation as a sovereign actor with a reductionist view of the firm as a network without boundaries or a nexus-of-contracts among separate individuals. We discuss the implications of this conceptualization for organization theory.

Halaby	American Sociological Review	51	5	1986-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 634-649	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper develops a sociological approach to worker attachment that differs markedly from the capital value model of labor economics and the job satisfaction/organizational committment approach of organizational psychology. Given that the worker's subordination is a key structural feature of the employment relation, the paper argues that the experience of subordination, as shaped by institutionalized normative codes governing the organization of domination, ought to be a central feature of models of attachment. Drawing on Weber's theory of authority, the paper holds that attachment is partly the outcome of a process whereby workers grade employer governance practices by reference to legitimating beliefs that prescribe proper modes of domination. Focusing on the American case, it is argued that this process of legitimation and attachment is governed largely by a belief in legality. A qualitative review of historical evidence suggests that, controlling for the economic rewards of work, the relationship between forms of governance and attachment over the last hundred years may be understood by reference to workers' belief in legality. The findings of an exploratory analysis of data from a firm and a national sample of workers lends additional support to the approach. The evidence weighs in favor of an approach that links normative principles of domination to worker attachment.

Hachen, Jr.	American Sociological Review	57	1	1992-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 39-55	American Sociological Association	fla		All firms operate in at least two markets: the product market and the labor market. I investigate the relationship between characteristics of these two markets by examining the effects of product market (industrial) characteristics on job mobility in labor markets. Informed by a theoretical model in which employer personnel strategies mediate the relationship between industrial characteristics and job mobility rates, hypotheses are formulated concerning the effects of six industrial characteristics--concentration levels, conglomerate domination, labor intensity, growth rates, wage levels, and average establishment size--on four types of job mobility--involuntary exits, quits, intra-firm moves, and upward authority moves. Among the findings are: (1) quit rates, intra-firm mobility rates, and upward authority mobility rates are low in high wage industries; (2) labor intensive industries have high involuntary exit rates and low inter- and intra-firm mobility rates; and (3) the effects of industry growth on job mobility vary depending on whether growth occurs through the emergence of new firms or the increasing size of existing firms.

I discuss these models, evaluate the ways they have been tested in the past, and then empirically determine the relative merits of the two theories in explaining voting behavior in the Basque Country in northern Spain. Previous tests of the ethnic competition and ethnic segregation models have suffered from serious problems. In particular, they have relied on indirect measures of ethnic labor market segregation and have failed to distinguish individual from contextual effects on ethnic political mobilization. I use direct measures of ethnic labor market segregation and rely on data that combines individual and contextual variables. I extend the scope of work on the relationship between levels of ethnic labor market segregation and ethnic political mobilization by focusing on an  over-developed  region of a multinational state. Using logit models, I demonstrate that the ethnic segregation model offers a better explanation of ethnic voting behavior in the Basque Country than does ethnic competition theory.

Whether or not a unique language persists into native-born generations is determined by the proportion of children who do not learn the language as a mother tongue. This process of mother-tongue shift has been generally viewed in the United States as one in which non-English languages quickly disappear between early generations as ethnic groups adapt to an English-dominated environment. This study more broadly views intergenerational language shift as a function of intra- and intergroup relations, focusing specifically on patterns of linguistic and ethnic intermarriage. The analysis, based on 1976 Survey of Income and Education data, shows that non-English languages disappear between generations as patterns of social interaction widen to include intimate associations outside of the non-English-language community, and outside of the ethnic descent group.

This approach extends traditional views of human development by demonstrating that socialization is a collective process that occurs in a social, rather than in a private, realm. To illustrate the interpretive approach, we present a multilayered analysis of two phases of a lengthy verbal routine (discussione) among Italian nursery school children. The analysis demonstrates how (1) the routine of discussione is produced sociolinguistically; (2) the production of the routine builds on and extends shared knowledge basic to peer culture; and (3) the children, in the course of producing the routine, attempt to deal with aspects of the world they do not fully grasp and, thereby, move closer toward appropriating certain elements of the adult culture.

State monopoly of the public sphere fosters and reproduces large numbers of individual behaviors with similar claims, patterns, and targets. The state bureaucratic apparatus at the workplace also generates similar discontents and links them with national politics. The  large numbers  phenomenon provides the basis for the formation of collective action. The institutional arrangements also induce frequent state policy shifts and alternative modes of mobilization, providing the opportunity for collective action. Finally, individual behaviors based on unorganized interests tend to converge in the same direction and assume a  collective  character--that is, they are often causally defined as  collective action  in this particular institutional structure. The phenomenon of  collective inaction  is discussed in the same vein.

Guest	American Sociological Review	55	2	1990-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 280-296	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper investigates the influence of generation and country of origin on occupational mobility between 1880 and 1900 among a sample of U.S. white men. Father-to-son mobility is examined for males 5 to 14 years old in 1880, and career mobility is analyzed for men aged 25 to 34 in the same year. While generation and national-origin groups clearly differed in their occupational distributions at each date, we find minimal evidence of differences in overall opportunities or in the relationship between occupational origins and destinations. Thus, on the whole, generation and country of origin appear to have had little influence on the mobility process in the late 1800s. There is some evidence that the men in our sample, who were overwhelmingly of Northern and Western European heritage, gained occupationally from the incipient flow of migrants from Southern and Eastern Europe.

A network-collective analysis indicates that the impact of a dyadic dominance contest on status depends critically on the reaction of group members who are bystanders to it. Structural conditions induced by the group's task encourage bystanders to intervene against members who claim status by dominance behavior, limiting its role in status allocation. In an experiment with four-person same-sex decision groups, two bystanders intervened to attack the dominance behavior of another confederate. Moreover, the dominant confederate was disliked and was no more influential in the group than a neutral confederate. These results held for both male and female groups, although levels of dominance behavior were higher in male groups.

Jiobu	American Sociological Review	53	3	1988-06-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 353-367	American Sociological Association	fla		This research proposes a model to explain how ethnic minorities establish an economic niche in the host society. The model emphasizes infrastructure and proposes the concept of ethnic hegemony a situation in which an ethnic group achieves economic control over an important economic arena that interfaces with the majority. By a priori specifying the model, it is possible to see how the ethnicity of a specific group might (or might not) reinforce the infrastructure. Japanese-Americans of California were used to assess the model empirically. Since the Japanese achieved remarkable upward mobility in the face of extreme discrimination, they constitute an important test of the model. Data drawn from various historical sources show that California Japanese hegemonized a specific arena of produce agriculture, from farm labor to production and through distribution. In a more limited way, they also hegemonized contract gardening. The model of ethnic hegemony was contrasted to the usual explanation for Japanese-American success--education. Distinctions between the model and the model of ethnic enclaves are discussed. In the future, the ethnic-hegemony model might be extended and specified to other ethnic minorities.

I apply this model in a thirteen-year panel study to examine the effects of adolescent subcultural preferences on later adult status attainments. Adolescents adrift from parental and educational control are more likely than those with more controls to develop mild or more seriously deviant subcultural preferences. I identify two distinct adolescent subcultural preferences: a subculture of delinquency and a party subculture. Among males with working-class origins, identification with the subculture of delinquency has a negative effect on trajectories of early adult status attainment. However, among males from non-working-class backgrounds, identification with a party subculture has a net positive effect when the negative effects of partying on educational performance are removed.

This study focuses on celebrity suicides. It uses a taxonomy of celebrities based on Tarde's laws of imitation and Pareto's concept of elite. Propositions are drawn from differential identification theory, using mass cultural values and beliefs as points of identification. The imitation effect holds only for American entertainers and political celebrities, not for artists, villains, and the economic elite. The amount of publicity given to suicides was positively related to the monthly incidence of suicide, but problems common to the celebrities and the suicidal population (divorce, physical illness, and poor mental health) were not. An interactive model in which the impact of a suicide story is mediated by the suicidogenic mood of the media audience did not improve on the simple additive model. Age, gender, and race-specific suicide rates tended to support identification theory.

The logic of comparative inquiry requires independent or independent uniform  cases  and formal quasi-experimental designs for comparative generalization. Global conceptions of social change violate formal comparative requirements, necessitating an alternative form of  incorporated comparison,  that takes both multiple/diachronic and singular/synchronic forms. Incorporated comparison is used to conceptualize variation across time and space when time and space dimensions are neither separate nor uniform. The fixed units of analysis employed by modernization and world-system theories yield to an alternative strategy of grounding the analytical units of comparison in the world-historical processes under investigation. Recent studies illustrate this alternative to formal comparison and incorporate comparison into the process of substantive inquiry.

The  empty nest  is associated with significant improvements in marital happiness for all parents, regardless of parent's or children's characteristics. Overall life satisfaction improves significantly only under two conditions: when there is frequent contact with nonresident children or when there were young teens in the 1983 household. For both measures of parental well-being, the positive effects of the empty nest appear to be strongest immediately after the children leave. These findings, coupled with the high levels of post-launching contact, suggest that while parents experience a modest post-launch honeymoon, the parental role remains important to parental well-being.

Bellas	American Sociological Review	59	6	1994-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 807-821	American Sociological Association	fla		Scholars of comparable worth have identified a negative bias against work typically performed by women, suggesting that the cultural devaluation of women leads to the devaluation of the work women do. Previous studies have demonstrated that both male and female incumbents of jobs employing high proportions of female workers suffer a wage penalty, earning less than those in comparable jobs with high proportions of male workers. I examine whether similar mechanisms operate in academia, asking whether higher proportions of women in academic disciplines depress faculty salaries in those disciplines, independent of the effects of labor-market conditions and conventional salary predictors. Findings from a contextual model show that faculty in disciplines employing high proportions of women suffer a wage penalty unexplained by differences in a number of disciplinary labor-market conditions or by variations in individual qualifications or job characteristics.

This analysis by separate sibsizes suggests that the influence of the father's education on the son's schooling has, indeed, been conditional on sibsize. Moreover, the interaction itself has differed according to the level of the son's education. Replication for three age groups, 20-34, 35-49, and 50-64, maintains the inverse relation between sibsize and mobility. In addition, for small and medium sibsizes, we find an increase in mobility over time, but, for large ones, virtually no change in the slopes for the father's education. The educational mobility of American men thus seems to have benefited from a dual set of trends-decreases in the effect (slope) of social origins on educational attainment among small and medium sibsizes, and a compositional shift in the population from large to smaller families.

Connell	American Sociological Review	57	6	1992-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 735-751	American Sociological Association	fla		I develop a conceptual approach to changes in masculinity that emphasizes the dynamics of the gender order as a whole. Homosexual masculinity is an important locus of these dynamics. After a critique of conventional discourses of masculinity I develop a theorized life-history method for researching gender. Analysis of eight life histories from an Australian gay community finds (1) initial engagement with hegemonic masculinity, (2) sexuality as the key site of difference, and (3) gradual closure based on relationships or on bodily experience that eroticizes similarity. Conventional masculinity is an aspect of the object of desire, yet is subverted by this object-choice; a contradictory masculinity is produced. Though the men in this study do not directly contest the gender order, the reification of  gayness  provides a social basis for sexual freedom, and the stabilization of a dissident sexuality opens possibilities for change in the social structure of gender.

Stinchcombe	American Sociological Review	59	6	1994-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 911-929	American Sociological Association	fla		Characteristics of two different social systems, island government and the particular master-slave relationship, jointly determined the degree of freedom of slaves in the Caribbean in the late eighteenth century. The degree to which an island was  a slave society  depended on the dominance of sugar cane in the island economy, and whether planters were internally well-organized and were powerful in the empire government. The Bahamas and Santo Domingo (the Dominican Republic) had low planter power on both criteria; Barbados and Antigua had high on both. Within a slave society, the degree to which a slave was treated like a free man or woman was determined by the slave owner's need for the slave's consent and enthusiasm as a trusted agent. This varied within islands: Slave pearl divers, dock workers, fishermen, mistresses, hucksters, soldiers, or cowboys tended to be nearly free when slaves and were likely to be formally or informally set free, even if island governments strongly limited their freedom.

Data are from 2,044 individuals, members of three generation families, grouped to form parent-youth (G2-G3) and grandparent-parent (G1-G2) dyads. Results suggest, first, that there is little convergence of parent-child attitudes with age when viewed cross-sectionally. Second, status inheritance processes do account for a substantial amount of observed parent-child similarity, but parental attitudes continue to significantly predict childrens' orientations after childhood. Third, child influences on parental attitudes are relatively strong and stable across age groups, while parental influence decreases with age, although the exact pattern of influence varies by attitude domain.

Zajac	American Sociological Review	61	5	1996-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 812-836	American Sociological Association	fla		While the  new institutionalism  has emerged as a dominant theory of organization-environment relations, very little research has examined its possible limits. Under what circumstances might the neoinstitutional predictions regarding organizational inertia, institutional isomorphism, the legitimacy imperative, and other fundamental beliefs be overshadowed by more traditional sociological theories accentuating organizational adaptation, variation, and the role of specific global and local technical environmental demands? We analyze longitudinal data from 1971 to 1986 for 631 private liberal arts colleges facing strong institutional and increasingly strong technical environments. Our findings reveal surprisingly little support for neoinstitutional predictions: (1) Many liberal arts colleges changed in ways contrary to institutional demands by professionalizing or vocationalizing their curricula; (2) global and local technical environmental conditions, such as changes in consumers' preferences and local economic and demographic differences, were strong predictors of the changes observed; (3) schools became less, rather than more, homogeneous over time; (4) schools generally did not mimic their most prestigious counterparts; (5) the illegitimate changes had no negative (and often had positive) performance consequences for enrollment and survival. Our results suggest that current research on organization-environment relations may underestimate the power of traditional adaptation-based explanations in organizational sociology.

Between 1960 and 1990, the number of Americans reporting an American Indian race in the U.S. Census more than tripled. This increase cannot be accounted for by simple population growth (increased births, decreased deaths, immigration), or by changing enumeration definitions or techniques. Researchers have concluded that much of this growth in the American Indian population results from  ethnic switching,  where individuals who previously identified themselves as  non-Indian  changed their race to  Indian  in a later census. The question posed here is: Why does such ethnic switching occur? Drawing on historical analyses and interview data, I argue that this growth in the American Indian population is one instance of ethnic renewal. I identify three factors promoting individual ethnic renewal: (1) federal Indian policy, (2) American ethnic politics, and (3) American Indian political activism. These three political factors raised American Indian ethnic consciousness and encouraged individuals to claim or reclaim their Native American ancestry, contributing to the observed Indian census population increase. American Indian ethnic renewal contributes to our general understanding of how ethnicity is socially constructed.

Peterson	American Sociological Review	54	5	1989-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 722-743	American Sociological Association	fla		In a recent analysis of the effect of execution publicity on homicides, Stack (1987) challenged the consensus of most social scientists that capital punishment does not effectively deter murder. He found that publicized executions have a very significant deterrent effect. Stack reports that 16 highly publicized executions may have saved as many as 480 innocent lives during 1950-1980. The present investigation attempts to shed additional light on the execution publicity/deterrence question. Our review of Stack's investigation shows that it suffers from a number of conceptual and methodological limitations. Correcting for these difficulties, we find no evidence that execution publicity influenced the rate of homicide during the 1950-1980 or 1940-1986 period. Some evidence suggests that higher levels of execution are associated with lower murder rates. However, the apparent deterrent effect is very slight and short term. Indeed, the cumulative effect of capital punishment on homicides during the execution and subsequent months is essentially zero.

The results indicate that the structural and cultural factors that explain homicide rates in the United States are also associated with sex- and age-specific homicide rates in other countries. Some factors, such as absolute deprivation and extent of official violence, are associated with higher risks across victim types. Others have effects that vary by the sex or age of the victim. For example, a measure of criminal opportunities has a significant effect on homicide rates of women and children, while economic inequality and cultural heterogeneity are associated with higher rates only for adults. Family dissolution is associated with higher risks for adults and older children, but not younger children.

Downey	American Sociological Review	60	5	1995-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 746-761	American Sociological Association	fla		Although the inverse relationship between the number of siblings and children's educational performance has been well established, explanations for this relationship remain primitive. One explanation, resource dilution, posits that parents have finite levels of resources (time, energy, money, etc.) and that these resources are diluted among children as sibship size increases. I provide a more rigorous investigation of the dilution model than previous studies, testing its implications with a sample of 24,599 eighth graders from the 1988 National Education Longitudinal Study. My analyses support the resource dilution model in three ways. First, the availability of parental resources decreases as the number of siblings increases, net of controls. The functional form of this relationship is not always linear, however, and depends on whether the resource is interpersonal or economic. Second, parental resources explain most or all of the inverse relationship between sibship size and educational outcomes. Finally, interactions between sibship size and parental resources support the dilution model as children benefit less from certain parental resources when they have many versus few siblings.

Several perspectives imply a negative effect of close spacing of siblings on educational attainment, but these perspectives differ in the mechanisms used to explain this effect. We use data from the High School and Beyond survey to investigate the effect of spacing on high school attrition and post-secondary school attendance. Our analysis confirms that close spacing increases the likelihood of dropping out of high school and decreases the odds of attending post-secondary school. The direct effect of close spacing on post-secondary school attendance persists net of ability and academic performance; the effect of spacing on dropping out of high school is mixed. Close spacing of siblings also constrains the allocation of family resources, which in turn affects educational attainment. Alternative explanations of the relationship between sibship structure and educational outcomes are reinterpreted in light of these findings.

Sutton	American Sociological Review	52	5	1987-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 612-630	American Sociological Association	fla		Most explanations of official social control point either toward reform movements or the imperatives of the social system as dominantly influencing imprisonment rates, with little attempt to integrate these distinct casual processes. This study aims to disentangle these effects by arguing that the strategic behavior of official state actors plays an intervening role in the punishment process that determines the relative salience of reform and systems effects. The empirical analysis focuses on the expansion of prisons and jails in the American states between 1880 and the early 1920s. Treating reform in terms of the adoption of probation, parole, and indeterminate sentencing legislation, and treating the social system as a store of resources likely to affect institutional expansion, the analysis pursues a series of dynamic additive and interactive models. The findings support the argument that reforms introduced discretion into the social control system and allowed official actors greater freedom to adjust their behavior to shifting bureaucratic and political constraints.

Landry	American Sociological Review	57	6	1992-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 781-799	American Sociological Association	fla		We evaluate a marital search model that links the quantity and quality of available men to first marriage transitions among black women and white women in the United States. Our analysis provides a more complex assessment of the hypothesis that racial differences in transitions to first marriage reflect shortages of marriageable men in local marriage markets. We attach several indicators of local marriage market conditions (primarily sex ratios from the 1980 Census) to women's marital histories available in the 1979 through 1986 waves of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Our discrete-time logit models support the following conclusions: (1) A shortage in the quantity and quality of available males in local areas depresses women's transitions to first marriage; (2) economic independence among women (as measured by employment and earnings) is positively associated with entry into marriage; (3) racial differences in mate availability account for a relatively small share of existing racial differences in marriage; (4) indicators of local mate availability nevertheless account for a larger proportion of observed racial differences in transitions to first marriage than factors such as family background, welfare status and living arrangements (e.g., multigenerational family); (5) the effects of marriage market characteristics are contingent on whether women are  searching  in the marriage market; and (6) the effect of a shortage of  economically attractive  men is not simply an artifact of local demographic deficits of men to marry.

Shalin	American Sociological Review	51	1	1986-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 9-29	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper examines the interfaces between pragmatism and interactionist sociology. Four tenets central to social interactionism have been selected for this study: the philosophical perspective on reality as being in the state of flux, the sociological view of social structure as emergent process, the methodological preference for participatory modes of research, and the ideological commitment to ongoing social reconstruction as a goal of sociological practice. It is argued that from the start interactionist sociologists were concerned with the problem of social order and sought new ways of conceptualizing social structure. Special emphasis is placed on the interactionists' predilection for a logic of inquiry sensitive to the objective indeterminacy of the situation. An argument is made that the failure of interactionist sociologists to address head-on the issues of power and inequality reflects not so much their uncritical reliance on pragmatism as their failure to follow consistently pragmatist tenets and to fulfill the political commitments of pragmatist philosophers.

Mortimer, Seongryeol Ryu	American Sociological Review	56	5	1991-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 597-611	American Sociological Association	fla		Adolescent orientations toward and expectancies about competent action are important predictors of adult attainment. Using panel data, this study shows that part-time work experiences and mastery orientation are reciprocally related among adolescents. Prior control orientation, measured by Pearlin's mastery scale, significantly influenced the character of boys' and girls' subsequent work experiences. Furthermore, extrinsic conditions and stressors at work were found to affect adolescents' control orientation. For boys, conditions of opportunity at work had a significant positive effect on tenth-grade mastery, whereas conflicts between school and work fostered a more external control orientation. Boys' educational plans for the future moderated the effects of conflict between school and work. Girls' evaluations of their pay were found to support an internal control orientation; however, responsibility for things that were perceived as being beyond their control engendered a more external control orientation.

Data are examined from national surveys focusing upon diverse indicators of tolerance, conducted between 1947 and 1982. The results suggest that the effects of city size--net of compositional variables--have declined. By contrast, the effects that can be uniquely attributed to region do not appear to have declined, and they almost always exceed the (unique) effects of city size.

In contrast to existing explanations that conceptualize the enclave as a special case of the primary sector, we emphasize the distinctive characteristics of ethnic economies, and explain the  enclave effect  using a single, consistent account of recruitment and skill acquisition processes in primary, secondary, and enclave labor markets. Unlike other sectors of the economy, the ethnic enclave is characterized by an external, informal training system that shapes the employment relationship and increases the availability and quality of information for workers and employers. We apply the concept to a case study of the New York garment industry.

Popielarz, Sonja Drobnic	American Sociological Review	57	2	1992-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 153-170	American Sociological Association	fla		In this paper we develop and test a theory of the dynamic behavior of voluntary groups. The theory combines an image of social network structure with the concept of natural selection to model changes in group composition over time. We consider the group to be a population of members subject to natural selection in sociodemographic space. According to the theory, the probability that members will enter or leave the group depends upon the number and strength of social network ties that connect group members to each other and to nonmembers. We analyze an event history dataset constructed from interviews using the Life History Calendar method and information on ego-centered social networks developed from the General Social Survey Network Module. We test the hypothesis that network connections inside a group are associated with reduced membership turnover, while connections outside the group increase turnover. We find that weak ties and network connections that span greater distances in sociodemographic space are positively correlated with leaving current groups and joining new ones. We conclude that weak ties are a major source of change in group composition.

We note the absence of direct measures of competition in the research on ethnic movements and the mixed nature of the evidence it produced. More important, the model does not specify the links between competition and conflict. We offer a partial reformulation that stresses the necessary conditions under which ethnic competition leads to ethnic conflict: (1) competition must be perceived as unfair and (2) competitive relations must be relatively free from interdependence. The reformulation also stresses that the main objects of competition in recent ethnic movements have not been individual goods like jobs, but larger collective goods. As amended, the model is compatible with the internal colonial and the split labor market models, as well as with the so-called contact hypothesis. Some hypotheses from the model are tested using data on Québec's independence movement. Competition leads to mobilization only when competition is perceived as unfair and it occurs in a context of low ethnic interdependence. We then explore the relevance of these findings for other situations.

Bridges	American Sociological Review	53	2	1988-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 237-255	American Sociological Association	fla		Building on previous demonstrations of a linkage between organizational size and individual outcomes, this paper employs a matched employer-employee data set to investigate that relationship. Some portion of the size effect on worker earnings is found to be indirect, as many have assumed, derived either through the organizational consequences of size or the industrial/market consequences of scale. However, the effect is not straightforward. It varies by group (gender, occupation, and industry), is differentially mediated by internal labor markets, literacy requirements, and unionization, differs according to whether firms are single- or multi-establishment, and for individuals as to whether firm size or establishment size is most salient to their earnings. For white-collar workers, firm size is most important, but not primarily due to organizational aspects of size. For blue-collar workers, establishment size is most important, largely due to the organizational concomitants of size. Female clerical workers are found to be a special case, and clear gender differences exist in the effect of size.

We replicate Stolzenberg's study using the 1979 Current Population Survey. This survey includes information on establishment size and provides a much larger sample size to work with. Our results do not indicate a positive establishment size/schooling interaction. To the contrary, when Stolzenberg's (1978) model specification is used, our findings suggest that the interaction may be negative. We explore the sources of this discrepancy and are skeptical of the conventional wisdom that returns to schooling increase with establishment size.

These data indicate that as migrants accumulate experience in the United States, social and economic ties are formed which progressively increase the likelihood of U.S. settlement. Over time, migrants bring family members abroad, make new friends, establish institutional connections, and obtain more stable, better paying jobs. As a result, less money is remitted home to Mexico, and more is spent in the United States. These trends give rise to a steady, cumulative increase in the probability of U.S. settlement.

Analyses of prescribed pay rates for jobs in the California state civil service in 1985 suggest that work done disproportionately by women and nonwhites is devalued most in positions that are older, not represented by activist unions, have ambiguous performance criteria, or are most generic across organizational settings. We conclude that the extent of ascription depends on propensities toward devaluation in a given setting, prospects for collective action by disadvantaged groups, and the organizational costs and benefits (economic and otherwise) of recalibrating job worth to achieve pay equity.

Whereas job involvement is quite volatile in the initial stage of the work career, it becomes more stable, supporting the  aging stability hypothesis,  as workers grow older. Work experiences and rewards also change less as workers age, suggesting that the growing stability with age in job involvement occurs in the context of an increasingly stable work environment. Work autonomy exerts a significant influence on job involvement in all age groups. However, the fact that this intrinsic dimension of work has the strongest influence on involvement in the youngest cohort supports the contention that there is a highly formative stage in young adulthood, after which time the person becomes more resistant to environmental pressures to change. The findings also suggest that the effects of job involvement on occupational achievement may be specific to the middle stage of the career. The results of this study indicate the potential of applying a life-span developmental perspective to the study of the sources and consequences of job involvement.

More compelling theoretical arguments can be made for causal relationships that operate over time between (1) a country's years of democratic experience and income inequality; and (2) income inequality and the stability of democracy. Continuous and qualitative measures of years of democratic experience are estimated to have a significant negative impact on income inequality independent of economic development and other control variables for a sample of 55 countries. A very strong inverse correlation is also observed between income inequality and regime stability for a sample of 33 democracies. This association holds independent of economic development, which is found to have no direct effect on democratic stability after controlling for income inequality.

I analyze the expansion of asylums as a product of organizational and political forces rather than an increase in insanity. The analysis is based on Grob's (1983) historical argument that asylums were forced to absorb increasing numbers of the aged poor who could no longer be confined in almshouses. This analysis is supplemented by a more comprehensive model that treats political factors--especially the fiscal capacities of state governments and the role of political parties--as fundamental determinants of institutional policy. This model is tested using longitudinal quantitative data for U.S. states. Results confirm the direct effects of almshouse capacities in an attenuated way, and show further that political organization influenced the production of insanity.

This paper attempts to reorient the empirical study of social policy development from its present concentration on aggregated social expenditures to a focus on the multidimensional aspects of the development of welfare states, social rights, and social citizenship. On the basis of a new data set describing the development of citizens' social rights in the main social insurance programs in 18 OECD countries since 1930, causal hypotheses derived from pluralist industrial, neo-Marxist, popular protest, state autonomy, and power resources approaches are tested. On the crucial issue of the role of left government participation in the extension of social rights, the hypotheses of the power resources approach are supported.

Muller	American Sociological Review	50	1	1985-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 47-61	American Sociological Association	fla		Death rate from political violence is postulated to vary cross-nationally as a positively accelerated time-lagged function of income inequality and as a nonmonotonic inverted  U  function of regime repressiveness. The former hypothesis is consistent with approaches to the explanation of collective political violence that emphasize the general concept of discontent or, more specifically, relative deprivation; the latter hypothesis is consistent with a political-process version of the resource mobilization approach. In the context of a multivariate model estimated across two decades, 1958-67 and 1968-77, support is found for the inequality hypothesis. Support also is found for the regime repressiveness hypothesis in the decade (1968-77) for which the index of regime repressiveness is available. The U-curve effect of regime repressiveness appears to have stronger impact on variation in rates of deadly political violence than the positively accelerated effect of income inequality.

Interviews with 299 male automobile workers revealed earnings variations that greatly exceed those of the East and the West. Hourly wages were determined more by workers' ascriptive status than by their human capital, while their monthly earnings were influenced more by their occupational skill than social status. By selectively allocating overtime work, management balanced rewards both for social status and for skill, enabling it to satify workers' equity norms and still respond flexibly to an uncertain market. Though both managers and workers voiced support of Confucian ethics, their self interests led them to respond to them in selective ways.

I specify and test a theory that locates the source of these wildcat strikes in a distinctive type of labor process. This labor process forced workers to coordinate their moment-by-moment activities to accomplish immediate work tasks. It generated group-level commitment to common work goals and created workgroup solidarity. This pre-existing solidarity enabled workers to mobilize effectively a commitment to wildcat action. I use logistic regression models to test this workgroup-solidarity thesis against hypotheses derived from alternative theoretical frameworks. Results strongly support the workgroup-solidarity thesis.

Brents	American Sociological Review	54	6	1989-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 891-909	American Sociological Association	fla		Recent neo-Marxian and state-centric analyses of the origins of the American welfare state have misspecified the autonomy of the state, thereby conflating policy formulation with policy-making and missing the complex political struggles that shaped the formulation of the Social Security Act of 1935. Synthesizing Poulantzas's  class struggle  theory of state with social protest theory and Domhoff's analysis of capitalist dominance, we advance a political struggle theory that identifies two major processes leading to social reforms: (1) sustained protest waves by excluded groups and threatened polity members that create a sense of political crisis among elites; and (2) hegemonic competition between capitalist blocs that use policy-planning and electoral investments to promote alternative political programs. This model is then applied to the formulation of the Social Security Act. Unemployed protests, industrial strikes, and middle-class reform movements, interacting with electoral instability, created an elite sense of political crisis. Simultaneously, rival capitalist blocs centered in bank groups and industrial segments competed for political dominance, creating opportunities for protest and placing major reforms on the national political agenda.

Matsueda, Karen Heimer	American Sociological Review	52	6	1987-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 826-840	American Sociological Association	fla		Studies of the relationship between race and delinquency have typically found that broken homes lead to greater delinquency among blacks than whites, but have not demonstrated empirically why this is so. This paper derives theoretical mechanisms from differential association theory and social control theory, specifying how broken homes may influence delinquency among both blacks and nonblacks. The analysis specifies a structural equation model of delinquency (Matsueda 1982), derives competing hypotheses from the two theories, and estimates a cross-population model for blacks and nonblacks using data from the Richmond Youth Project. Consistent with previous research, we find that broken homes have a larger impact on delinquency among blacks than nonblacks, but, unlike previous studies, our model explains this effect completely. In both populations, the effects of broken homes and attachment to parents and peers are mediated by the learning of definitions of delinquency, a finding that supports differential association over social control theory.

Miller McPherson, Lynn Smith-Lovin	American Sociological Review	51	1	1986-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 61-79	American Sociological Association	fla		We analyze the sex composition of 815 face-to-face voluntary organizations in 10 communities to determine the extent of sex integration produced by voluntary affiliation. The sex segregation in these groups is substantial; nearly one-half of the organizations are exclusively female, while one-fifth are all male. Instrumental organizations (business-related and political groups) are more likely to be sex heterogeneous, while expressive groups are likely to be exclusively male or female. From the point of view of the individual, the typical female membership generates face-to-face contact with about 29 other members, less than four of whom are men. Male memberships, on the other hand, produce contact with over 37 other members on the average, nearly eight of whom are female. Men's contacts are both more numerous and more heterogeneous. We conclude that there is little support for the sex integration hypothesis in these data, although the sex heterogeneity of instrumental groups (especially those which are job-related) indicates that this pattern may change as women move into the labor force in increasing numbers. The paper explores some consequences of segregation for the organizations and the social networks they generate.

Class Location and Class Identity in the United States, Sweden, Norway, and Australia	Janeen Baxter	American Sociological Review	59	2	1994-04-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 220-235	American Sociological Association	fla		Class analysis traditionally has focused on the position of men in the occupational system: Women have been ignored completely or classified according to the status of the male head of household. This approach implies that women derive their class identities from the class locations of their husbands. However, recent research suggests that this  conventional  view of class analysis is challenged by women's increasing independence from men. I address this issue using comparative data for the United States, Sweden, Norway, and Australia. I use a series of logistic regression models to examine the relationship between husband's and wife's class locations and subjective class identifications. Results indicate that husband's class location is a significant predictor of husband's and wife's class identifications. Education is also a key determinant of subjective class identity. There is no evidence of significant differences among countries in these patterns.

Evans	American Sociological Review	54	6	1989-12-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 950-962	American Sociological Association	fla		Why is business ownership common in some immigrant groups, but rare in others? Building on organizational ecology, it may be argued that the immigrant group acts as an economic niche for small business. Large groups provide a more favorable niche for ethnic entrepreneurs than small groups, because large groups provide large specialized ethnic markets. Groups whose members are not fluent in the dominant language provide more favorable niches for immigrant entrepreneurs, because they provide a linguistically isolated labor pool whose skills can be more efficiently tapped by coethnic rather than majority group entrepreneurs. Because of its large and heterogeneous immigrant population, Australia is a particularly appropriate site for testing these hypotheses. With a one-percent Public Use Sample of the 1981 Australian Census, a multilevel logistic regression model predicts individuals' probabilities of business ownership as a function of the size of the group (ethnic market size), the percent of the group who speak English badly (the linguistically isolated labor pool), and the individual's own language skills and human capital characteristics. The results support both hypotheses.

Logan	American Sociological Review	50	1	1985-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 106-117	American Sociological Association	fla		The suburban population in the United States has aged more rapidly than the population as a whole. This paper examines the suburbanization of the elderly during 1960-1980 for a national sample of metropolitan regions. The increasing proportion of residents age 65 and over has been accompanied by declining segregation of the elderly among suburbs in most metropolitan regions. During this period suburbs with older populations were relatively poor but had higher municipal expenditures. Those in the North also had higher density, higher proportions of rental housing, more local employment, and higher taxes than other suburbs. Increases in proportion elderly are greater in slow-growing inner suburbs, but are linked to lower proportions of black residents, more trade employment, and a stronger tax base.

Hargis	American Sociological Review	56	5	1991-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 583-596	American Sociological Association	fla		The concept of a family economy plays an important role in theory and research on the social impact of industrialization. Using family-level data from an 1890 survey of working class families in the U.S., we analyze the impact of the family economy on the school and work activities of children. Our analysis differentiates the family economy from the local economy and regional factors. Four hypotheses derived from family economy theory predict the allocation of children's time to school and work. Our results lend strong empirical support for all hypotheses. In particular, we found that higher levels of family resources and lower levels of demand on those resources are associated with higher rates of children's participation in school and lower rates of children's participation in wage labor. These effects are stable after controls are introduced for family demographic composition, local economy, and region.

We extend this approach using the concepts of event public, collective actor, action set, and opposition network. Analyses of communication network and policy event participation data from the U.S. and German national labor policy domains in the 1980s reveals similar spatial patterns in three dimensions: Opposing business and labor coalitions structured many of the legislative fights; no central body emerged to coordinate actions; and organizational interests were central to action-set formation. Political resources played minor roles. Structural differences between U.S. and German domains are attributed to institutional contexts.

Wilson	American Sociological Review	56	1	1991-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 117-123	American Sociological Association	fla		Previous research has found only modest effects of community size on social psychological characteristics of residents. Focusing on urban experience, I find that urbanism's impact on personality may be stronger than previously thought. For respondents whose urban experience is adequately reflected by available community size measures, community size has strong positive effects on tolerance. Migration also promotes tolerance regardless of size of destination community.

Alexander	American Sociological Review	57	1	1992-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 72-84	American Sociological Association	fla		In a longitudinal study of a random sample of Baltimore youngsters starting first grade, the mathematics achievement level of African-Americans and whites was almost identical. Two years later, African-American students had fallen behind by about half a standard deviation. We use mathematics test score changes over the summer when school is closed to estimate  home  influences, and we investigate three major hypotheses that might account for lower mathematics achievement among African-Americans. The most important source of variation in mathematics achievement is differences in family economic status, followed by school segregation. Two-parent (father-present) vs. one-parent (father-absent) family configurations are probably negligible as a cause when economic status is controlled. Poor children of both races consistently lose ground in the summer but do as well or better than better-off children in winter when school is in session. We discuss the theoretical and policy implications of these findings.

Herriott	American Sociological Review	53	4	1988-08-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 528-543	American Sociological Association	fla		Scholars disagree about the relationship between division of labor and intraorganizational conflict. From one perspective, division of labor increases goal disagreement, which in turn leads to conflict. Another view suggests that division of labor reduces both administrative control and levels of conflict. A third poses that division of labor enhances administrative control to suppress conflict. Using Durkheim's distinction between mechanical and organic social systems, this paper examines the antecedents of conflict in 111 American public schools. A causal model is tested using measures of role specialization, goal disagreement, dominance of rules, and occupational disputes. Data provide most support for the perspective that division of labor is indirectly but ultimately related to disputes through direct correlations with both goal disagreement and enhanced control. However, disputes increase and do not decrease when rules dominate the control structure.

Anderson	American Sociological Review	55	1	1990-02-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 63-74	American Sociological Association	fla		Disarticulation refers to the juxtaposition of economic sectors with different levels of development and productivity. Disarticulation is hypothesized to have a negative effect on social well-being, net of economic development, because it inhibits the spread effects generally thought to be associated with economic growth. Findings are in accord with this hypothesis, although the relationship is complex. The strongest effects of disarticulation are found among the poorest nations. The concept of disarticulation opens a new and promising avenue of research that may help to resolve contradictory findings of recent research on the political economy of growth.

This study takes up the causes of the dissemination of that form among large firms from 1919 to 1979. Five theories are initially proposed as possible explanations for the changes observed and these theories are operationalized and tested. The model that seems most consistent with the data emphasizes the ability of key actors to alter structure under three circumstances: when the firm has a product-related or -unrelated strategy (which is consistent with Chandler's [1962] theorizing); when the corporate presidents have a background in sales or finance; and when other firms in the industry alter their structures. The implications of these results for theories of organizational change are discussed with special reference to the importance of conceiving how actors operate with varying rationalities in this process.

Harer	American Sociological Review	52	5	1987-10-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 702-710	American Sociological Association	fla		This paper tests the cohort size hypothesis that crime rates fluctuate according to the relative size of the age (birth) cohort. The hypothesis is tested using arrest statistics of the Uniform Crime Reports for the years 1953-84. Statistics on the Index Crime rate and on the individual index crimes are included in the analysis. The age-period-cohort analysis reveals large age and period effects but small cohort effects. The statistical tests demonstrate that cohort size is not a good predictor of cohort variability. No cohort size effect emerges on the Index Crime Rate or in the individual index crimes. Thus, the data do not support the hypothesis. We suggest possible explanations for these contrary findings and speculate that the cohort size thesis is flawed on theoretical grounds.
