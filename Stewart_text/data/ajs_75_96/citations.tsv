Goldfarb	American Journal of Sociology	83	4	1978-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 920-939	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Owing to official support of cultural traditions, the critical aspects of marxism, and the development of limited autonomy in cultural istitutions, independent public expression can and does develop in Communist societies despite the will of the political elite. In this paper, independent public expression is shown to be inherent in Communist societies; consequently, the relationship between politics and cultural life in these societies is considerably more complex than observers have posited.

Williamson	American Journal of Sociology	87	3	1981-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 548-577	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The transaction cost approach to the study of economic organization regards the transaction as the basic unit of analysis and holds that an understanding of transaction cost economizing is central to the study of organizations. Applications of this approach require that transactions be dimensionalized and that alternative governance structures be described. Economizing is accomplished by assigning transactions to governance structures in a discriminating way. The approach applies both to the determination of efficient boundaries, as between firms and markets, and to the organization of internal transactions, including the design of employment relations. The approach is compared and contrasted with selected parts of the organization theory literature.

An endogenous model of the uneven pattern of 16th-century state formation is presented. It holds that the geographical distribution of the first modern state structures was largely determined by preexisting regional differences of social and economic organization, differences emanating from the 12th century if not earlier. The model specifies that three distinct regional modes of production existed in 12th-century western Europe. These postulated forms of social organization are designated as the sedentary pastoral, petty commodity, and feudal modes of production. The optimal preconditions for the initial formation of modern states were to be found only in those regions dominated by the feudal mode  of production. The paper concludes with a discussion of some methodological and theoretical implications of these findings.

(1) Normative consensus may ensure order in a way which can be "generalized." (2) Sociology must be an "analytic" science. Both premises are criticized, the former because it is empirically false, the latter because in its Parsonian conception it would render sociology nonfalsifiable. It is further argued that Parsons, while contiuning to cling to his normative solution to the problem of order, eventually abandoned his early interpretation of the analytic status of sociology, and therewith deprived his solution to the Hobbesian problem of an essential prop. Finally, the whole Parsonian approach to social science is shown to issue from a metaphysical view of social reality as a composite of several spheres, each of them sui generis.

Faunce	American Journal of Sociology	95	2	1989-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 378-400	The University of Chicago Press	fla		It is commonly assumed that work necessarily affects self esteem, but the research evidence does not support this assumption. Instead, evidence suggests a wide variation in the relationship between occupational achievement and self assessment. This article proposes an explanation for this variation based on the postulate that the effects of the status on self esteem occur not simply as a result of knowledge of one's location in a status hierarchy but, more important, as a result of the frequency with which one is reminded of that location. If this postulate is correct, it becomes important to identify variables that call attention to occupational achievement. This article introduces the concept of the "status-assignment system" and discusses structural characteristics of such systems that produce reminders of status location.

Persons who are remarried after a divorce and have children from previous marriages face problems unlike those encountered in first marriages. The institution of the family provides no standard solutions to many of these problems, with the result that the unity of families of remarriages after divorce often becomes precarious. The incomplete institutionalization of ramarriage shows us, by way of contrast, that family unity in first marriages is still supported by effective institutional controls, despite claims that the institutional nature of family life has eroded in the 20th century. Some suggestions for future research on remarriage and on the institutionalization of married life are presented.

This article outlines and explains this paradigm split and the resulting shifts of critical theories from "reproduction" to "resistance" to "post-Marxist" versions, then explains how these approaches differ from the mainstream and what their internal dynamic is. The article argues that the "immanentism"-the practice of asserting a necessary movement of history that confers subordinate groups with objective interest in radical change-of critical approaches is the source of theoretical difference and that the trajectory of critical theories reflects shifting conceptions of how this change will occur.

Wong	American Journal of Sociology	90	3	1984-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 584-607	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Based on the Census of the Population for 1960 and 1970 and the Survey of Income and Education in 1976, this study analyzes socioeconomic inequality between five minority populations (blacks, Hispanics, Japanese, Chinese, and Filipinos) and the majority population (white non-Hispanics) and the decomposes ethnic "gaps" into shares that are "explained" by age, nativity, residence, education, and other social background attributes. In general, Asian Americans approach socioeconomic parity with whites because of their overachievement in educational attainment. Over the past decade, there has been a marked decline in the direct negative effect of ethnicity on earnings (except among Chinese Americans). This suggests that the old-fashioned "open" discrimination by employers may be on the wane, but the remaining ethnic inequality, rooted in differential access to institutional settings, may be more persistent.

DiPrete	American Journal of Sociology	87	2	1981-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 286-307	The University of Chicago Press	fla		An analysis of the unemployment experience of white and nonwhite male heads of household was conducted using methods of partial likelihood. The results show job tenure to be the most important determinant of unemployment experience but point to the complications involved in interpreting its effects when the sample studied has mixed levels of age and job quality. Nonwhites differ in unemployment experience from whites mostly at low tenure levels, but they tend to be more sensitive to recessions at higher levels of tenure as well.

Marsden	American Journal of Sociology	86	6	1981-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1203-1235	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper modifies and extends the model of collective decisionmaking processes proposed by Coleman in The Mathematics of Collective Action by introducing a process in which the interests expressed by actors may be influenced by those of other actors. After incorporation of this individual-level process within the framework of Coleman's model, its effects at the system level are explored by comparing results generated by the modified model with those produced by the original model. Analyses of artificial data indicate that the nature and magnitude of system-level effects are contingent on (1) the pattern of interest differentiation in the influence network; and (2) the degree of centralization of the influence network. Depending on these features, the effects of the influence process on collective decision making may be (1) a decline in the system level of resource mobilization; (2) an increase in the level of apparent consensus on collective decisions; and/or (3) a bias in collective decisions toward the interests of the actors centrally located in the influence network.

Edelman	American Journal of Sociology	95	6	1990-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1401-1440	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article examines the effect of legal environments on the expansion of due process in organizational governance. Event-history analyses of personnel practices in 52 organizations show that the civil rights mandates of the 1960s created a normative environment that threatened the legitimacy of arbitrary organizational governance. This precipitated a diffusion of formal grievance procedures for nonunion employees. Proximity to the public sphere, number of employees, and structural differentiation of the personnel function rendered organizations more vulnerable to normative pressure. Variation along these dimensions explains variations in the rates of rights expansion across organizations.

Mathis	American Journal of Sociology	97	4	1992-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 970-993	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The authors analyze recent state intervention to control health care costs as both reflecting and fostering changes in previously prevailing patterns of dominance among health care elites and between those elites and nonhealth elites. The authors contend that these health policy outcomes reflect a divergence of material interests and a political fragmentation among dominant health elites and between those and nonhealth, especially corporate, elites, which previously allowed health provider elites to control the health policy agenda. Empirical analysis shows that patterns of fragmentation among hospital elites and cohesion among business elites, in the form of business coalition development, can account for the adoption/retention of the four predominant state health care cost containment policies during the period 1981-87. The authors conclude that a political and economic restructuring of elite dominance is taking place but it is occurring unevenly across states and regions.

It was designed to test the widely supported theory that the recidivism rate of ex-convicts could be reduced or retarded by providing them for a time with a monthly monetary allowance. During the evaluation of the experiment, a radical difference of opinion over the correct interpretation of its results arose between the evaluators (Peter H. Rossi, Richard A. Berk, and Kenneth J. Lenihan) and Hans Zeisel, a member of the advisory board. This article, together with the comment and reply that follow it, explicates this difference and attempts to resolve it.

Parker Frisbie, Lisa Neidert	American Journal of Sociology	82	5	1977-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1007-1030	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Socioeconomic differentials separating whites and blacks have been shown to correlate positively with the percentage of blacks in a population. However, in multiracial or multiethnic populations, it is necessary to take into account the effects of the relative size of each minority present in nonnegligible numbers. In the research reported here, the relationship between socioeconomic inequality and the proportion of Mexican Americans and blacks in the population of metropolitan areas was decomposed through path-analytic techniques. Analysis of model incorporating the impact of the size of both minorities indicates that minority income levels are inversely related to minority size and that disparities between majority and minority income and occupation tend to grow as relative minority size increases. Mexican American occupational levels vary positively with the percentage of blacks, but black occupational status was foud th be virtually unrelated to the proportional representation of Mexican Americans in metropolitan areas. Finally, the positive relationship between minority percentage and inequalities of income and occupation persists net of the effects of a number of plausible alternative explanations.

I approach this question by considering the applicability of the perspectives on modern society of Marx, Durkheim, and Weber to the United States. Arguing that it is perhaps Weber who is of greatest heuristic worth in interpreting American society because of his sensitivity to the Protestant ethos, I illustrate this line of analysis by drawing attention to two major Puritan cultural themes: "wilderness" and "voluntarism."

Kemper	American Journal of Sociology	93	2	1987-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 263-289	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Fundamental in the field of emotions is the question of how many emotion there are or there can be. The answer proposed here is that the number of possible emotions is limites. As long as society differentiates new social situations, labels them, and socializes individuals to experience them, new emotions will continue to emerge. But this view must be qualified by an understanding of the autonomic constraints that limit variability in the experience of emotions. It is argued here that there are four psychologically grounded primary emotions: fear, anger, depression, and satisfaction. They are evolutionarily important, cross-culturally universal, ontogenetically early to emerge, and link empirically with important outcomes of social relations. Secondary emotions, such as guilt, shame, pride, gratitude, love, nostalgia, ennui, and so forth, are acquired through socializing agents who define and label such emotions while the individual is experiencing the autonomic reactions of one of the "primaries." Hence, it is argued here, guilt is a socialized response to arousal of the physiological conditions of fear; shame to those of anger; pride to those of satisfaction; and so on. This integration of primary with secondary emotions incorporates the contributions of both positivist and social constructionist positions in the sociology of emotions.

Allison	American Journal of Sociology	83	1	1977-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 144-153	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Contrary to a recent claim, the inclusion of a product term in a multiple regression is a legitimate way to test for interaction. The unstandardized coefficient and the t-test for the product term are unaffected by the addition of arbitrary constants to the variables in the model. Certain other statistics are affected by this change, however, indicating that some hypotheses relating to interaction are not meaningfully testable unless variables are measured on ratio scales.

Lancaster Jones, Patrick McDonnell, Paul Duncan-Jones	American Journal of Sociology	84	2	1978-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 417-426	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The traditional method for assesing generational mobility hass been exposed to remeasurement studies but not to the test of an alternative questioning strategy. This paper describes a design in which intergenerational mobility is studies from two perspectives. In the conventional approach sons report on their own statuses and give proxy reports for parental statuses. In our second perspective parents are questioned about themselves and give proxy information on their children. Estimates of a five-variable status-attainment model for eachperspective yield similar results, but some correlations and regressions differ significantly because nonrandom errors influence the reporting of socioeconomic data among adults. Our anomalous findings suggest that mobility researchers might consider employing both questioning strategies as a guide to potential biases until a definitive test shows that the caution prescribed in this paper is unwarranted. Consumers of mobility studies are entitled to reserve judgment on data that depend entirely on the traditional approach even though current research adheres to it almost without exception.

Cultural capital arguments lead to the expectation that the mediation process operates differently for highbrow and popular genres, while the idea of cultural convergence does not predict such an effect. Data on 624 shows and 1,204 primary reviews from the Edinburgh Festival Fringe are used to investigate the relationship between reviewers' evaluations and audience attendance. The results show that positive reviews are associated with greater audience participation, net of other factors, but the effect is limited to highbrow performance genres such as theater. Critics do not have the power to "make or break" shows. The visibility provided by reviews is more important than their evaluative function. The findings support the idea that the operative aesthetics in popular and highbrow genres are distinct, and critics are important only in the latter.

Organizational learning and institutional theories are used as research guidelines to explore the effects of path dependency, attention allocation, governmental intervention, and historical context on the evolution of organizational rules. The findings suggest that rule founding and rule change follow two distinctive processes. The former largely reflects an organizational response to external crisis and shocks, while the latter is strongly regulated by an internal learning process. Once rules are established, they are path dependent, sensitive to agenda setting, and adaptive to governmental constraints. There is also evidence that rules are institutionalized over time.

Vanneman	American Journal of Sociology	85	4	1980-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 769-790	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This research tests one aspect of the widely held belief that Americans are less class conscious than Europeans. Analysis of subjective class placements in the United States and Great Britain indicates that there is virtually no difference in the way social structural position is used to define middle- or working-class placement. The lack of any statistically significant interactions suggest that class is as clearly perceived in the United States as in Great Britain. The conventional wisdom about differences in the class consciousness of the two societies is probably the result of the substantial differences in the class basis of party affiliation and voting. Given the similarities in the perception of class, the political differences would be better explained by structural differences in the party systems than by psychological differences in the voters themselves.

Heltman	American Journal of Sociology	80	6	1975-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1391-1409	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Blacks moving from the South to the North have had lower levels of education and have taken lower status jobs than northern-born blacks. Nevertheless, data from the 1970 census indicate that after a few years' residence in the North the southern-born blacks are able to earn higher incomes than northern-born blacks, apparently due in part to higher labor force participation rates. For these reasons, controlling for age and education reduces the income difference between blacks and whites, but controlling for age and region of birth increases it. Southern-born whites in the North and West have tended to have lower levels of education, higher unemployment rates, and lower incomes than whites of similar age in the North and West who are not interregional migrants. Interpretations, explanations, and uses of these findings are suggested, especially with regard to past and future changes in the black-white income ratio.

This article presents a new approach to studying the factors that determine employment outcomes. It develops a statistical technique, two-sided logit (TSL), directly from a model of the preferences and resources of employers and workers. Opportunity and choice are functions of these preferences and resources. Application of the TSL model to 1972-90 GSS data shows substantial variation in the importance of the worker characteristics of education, race, and age for the opportunity for employment in different occupational categories. The relationships of TSL to other sociological and economic models are also discussed.

This article examines the empirical evidence for the existence of Hawthorne effects using the original data from the Hawthorne Relay Assembly Tes Room. Allowing for a variety of other factors, the author assesses whether experimental changes, variously defined, had a common effect that could be regarded as a pure result of the experimentation. The main conclusion is that these data show slender or no evidence of a Hawthorne effect.

Such an elite is seen to profit through the increasing intensification of the land use of the area in which its members hold a common interest. An elite competes with other land-based elites in an effort to have growth-inducing resources invested within its own area as opposed to that of another. Governmental authority, at the local and nonlocal levels, is utilized to assist in achieving this growth at the expense of competing localities. Conditions of community life are largely a consequence of the social, econimic, and political forces embodied in this growth machine. The relevance of growth to the interests of various social groups is examined in this context, particularly with reference to the issue of unemployment. Recent social trends in opposition to growth are described and their potential consequences evaluated.

A more recent approach to recruitment argues that interpersonal bonds between members and potential recruits are the essential element. In this paper we first show that these are complementary, not competing, approaches. Then, because the available evidential base for the role of interpersonal bonds is limited and qualitative, we present quantitative data pertaining to three quite different radical religious groups. In each case there is overwhelming support for the crucial role played by social networks in the formation and growth of such groups. Next we seek the boundaries of this phenomenon.Available studies suggest that not merely cult and sect recruitment, but commitment to conventional faiths as well, is supported by social networks.However, networks do not seem to play an important role in acceptance of mildly deviant occult beliefs. Belief in seances and tarot cards, for example, seems to spread via the mass media with little mediation by social networks. We discuss the implications of these findings for a theory of cult and sect recruitment.

The organization of academia gives all departments problems in self-governance. But these problems are intensified for sociology by features that can be sources of both strength and weakness (e.g., an affinity for students with agendas of reform and radical criticism) and that tend to attract critical attention from administrators and make it hard for sociologists to agree how to respond to external threats. The expansion of the American Sociological Association's activities beyond its original focus exacerbates the difficulties of dealing with disciplinary issues and reaching consensual strategies to confront them.

Ragin	American Journal of Sociology	86	6	1981-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1311-1347	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This cross-national study of the effects of dependency and state efficacy on development supports the "structural blockage" argument of dependency theory. According to this argument, international economic dependency impedes development in the more advanced countries of the periphery of the world capitalist system. In support of this argument, we show that two forms of participation in the world economy, the export of a small number of commodities and the export of primary products, obstruct development in advanced peripheral countries. The argument that these forms of participation in trade pose internal, structural obstacles to development is supported by evidence showing that state-sponsored institutional transformations outweigh the development-stunting influence of these forms of participation. On the basis of these findings, we argue against the divergent-development thesis implied in some dependency arguments.

Jensen, Kevin Thompson	American Journal of Sociology	95	4	1990-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1009-1023	The University of Chicago Press	fla		In recent issues of this journal, J. Hagan, A. R. Gillis, and J. Simpson elaborate a power- control theory of common deliquency. They propose a positive relationship between neo-Marxist conceptions of class and common forms of delinquency, patterns of variation in gender differences by class, and intervening variables to explain these variations. An examination of class, gender, and delinquency in three U.S. data sets did not reveal the same patterns. A neo- Marxist categorization of the labor force was generally unrelated to common delinquency, and there was no evidence of paterned class-gender variations of the sort reported in their 1985 analysis. Gender differences by race were consistent with their theory, while racial differences were not. Moreover, an attempted reconstruction of data for the full set of household categories reported in the 1987 analysis raises important questions about the nature of class variations and the role of patriarchal imbalance in generating gender differences.

New-class theorists have depicted these "knowledge workers" as engaged in a contest for power and status with traditionally powerful business elites. However, the liberal attitudes of knowledge workers may also be interpreted as the result of a conjunction of several general trends in American society that have had little to do with class antagonisms. According to this paper, even though left-of-center attitudes are not uncommon in the salaried professional categories, these attitudes tend to be more ferormist than antibusiness in character. Such dissent as exists is concentrated in particular occupational, cohort, and sectoral categories and has varied considerably over time. Only the younger specialists in social science and arts-related occupations beging to fit the image of an "oppositional intelligentsia" used by the theorists to characterize the new class at large. The data are more consistent with cumulative-trend explanations of upper-white-collar liberalism and dissent. Nevertheless, the consistent net association of the key new-class category, the higher levels of education, with political liberalism leaves room for continued thinking about political cultural conflic within a new-class framework.

Marsden, Joseph Galaskiewicz	American Journal of Sociology	83	3	1977-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 594-631	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The conception of community leadership structure as a regularized pattern of communication and exchange of information pertinent to community affairs among members of a community elite, proposed by Laumann and Pappi (1973-1976), is extended in several related direcions. First, the network of regularized communication contact is related to issue-specific discussion patterns and to outcome preference and activation on specific issues. Our anlysis indicates that our measure of the routinized community-affairs discussion network is valid in that it represents a distillation of contact patterns that exist with regard to a variety of specific issues. Moreover, discussion contacts among the elite on routine, instrumental issues are found to be more closely reflected in the regularized network than are such contacts on unique, value-laden consummatory issues. We also find a moderated degree of "institutionalization" of contact patterns and support for an instrumentally orientad "bargaining" model of issue resolution in two American communities. Cross-community variations in bases of communication contact discussed in the latter part of the paper suggest that such a model may be associated with the use of business/professional ties in an influence structure, while an "oppositional" model may be characteristics of communities in which contact patterns are rooted in informal social relations.

Micro-evidence and theoretical critiques indicate that human cognitive capacity is limited. Hence actor facing complex contingencies rely largely upon tacit assumptions and routine. The routines of physical property and organizational authority are upheld by actors' tacit monitoring of social coalitions. Individuals continuously negotiate such coalitions in chains of interaction rituals in which conversations create symbols of group membership. Every encounter is a marketpace in which individuals tacitly match conversational and emotional resources acquire from previous encounters. Individuals are motivated to move toward those ritual encounters in which their microresources pay the greatest emotional returns until they reach personal equilibrium points at which their emotional returns stabilize or decline. Large-scale changes in social structure are produced by aggregate changes in the three types of microresources: increases in generalized culture due to new communications media or specialized culture-producing activities; new "techologies" of emotional production; and new particularized cultures (individual reputations) due to dramatic, usually conflictual, events. A method of macrosampling the distribution of microresources is proposed.

Land, Marcus Felson	American Journal of Sociology	82	3	1976-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 565-604	The University of Chicago Press	fla		It is generally agreed that social indicators are measures of social conditions. Accordinlgy, recent interest in measuring social conditions and in building models of how various social forces determine changes in social conditions was predated by work of William F. Ogburn and his collaborators over 50 years ago. In this paper, we argue for a revival of analyses of social change based upon time series of indices of social conditions. To provide a general paradigm for this type of analysis, we describe (1) an opportunity-structures theoretical framework for generating specifications of equations of dynamic macro social indicator models, (2) a demographic accounting framework for grounding such equations in population stocks and flows, and (3) a structural equation strategy for estimating and evaluating the resulting models. To illustrate this paradigm, we present analyses of three equation determining changes in the national reported property crime rate, the reported violent crime rate, and the rate of public police expenditures. The equations fit annual 1947-72 time-series data well, yield theoretically meaningful coefficients, and lack demonstrable autocorrelation of disturbances. Moreover, the conditional forecasts of the 1973 values of the reported crime rates fall well within bounds set by the standard errors of the equations.

Coleman	American Journal of Sociology	94		1988-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. S95-S120	The University of Chicago Press	fla		In this paper, the concept of social capital is introduced and illustrated, its forms are described, the social structural conditions under which it arises are examined, and it is used in an analysis of dropouts from high school. Use of the concept of social capital is part of a general theoretical strategy discussed in the paper: taking rational action as a starting point but rejecting the extreme individualistic premises that often accompany it. The conception of social capital as a resource for action is one way of introducing social structure into the rational action paradigm. Three forms of social capital are examined: obligations and expectations, information channels, and social norms. The role of closure in the social structure in facilitating the first and third of these forms of social capital is described. An analysis of the effect of the lack of social capital available to high school sophomores on dropping out of school before graduation is carried out. The effect of social capital within the family and in the community outside the family is examined.

In this article a measure of status-culture participation (or cultural capital) is developed from the responses of men and women interviewed in 1960 by Project Talent. Questions tapped a range of high-cultural interests and activities. Analyses of data from a follow-up study 11 years later show significant effects of cultural capital (with appropriate controls) on educational attainment, college attendence, college completion, graduate attendance, and marital selection for both men and women.

Seltzer	American Journal of Sociology	96	4	1991-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 895-929	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article investigates the effects of legal custody arrangements on the amount of child support fathers pay after divorce, contrasting the experiences of families in which parents share authority over children through jont legal custody and those in which mothers have sole legal custody. It argues that join legal custody encourages similarities between the way divorced fathers and fathers in two-parent households invest in their children. The analysis used data from a representative sample of recent divorces, in which children live with their mothers, to explore the relationship between legal custody and legal child-support obligations (awards) and to investigate the effects of the type of custody on child-support payments. Joint legal custody is associated with higher support awards, but the association is explained by the higher incomes of fathers with joint custody. Legal custody arrangements do not affect levels of child-support payments when family characteristics and the amont of child support awarded at divorce are taken into account. Legal custody does,however, alter the process governing fathers' contributions to child support. Parents' incomes have a larger effect, and child-supprt awards a smaller one, on payments among families with joint legal custody, suggesting that joint legal custody may allow fathers greater discretion about contributions to child support. By stengthening ties between divorced fathers and children, join legal custody may increase the correspondence between parents' and children's socioeconomic status and result in greater inequality among children of divorce.

Keith, Cedric Herring	American Journal of Sociology	97	3	1991-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 760-778	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Data from the National Survey of Black Americans (NSBA)(1979-80) are used to examine the effects of skin-tone variations of blacks on educational attainment, occupation, and income, net of such antecedent factors as parental socioeconomic status and such contemporaneous factors as sex, region of residence, urbanicity, age, and marital status. The findings are that not only does complexion have significant net effects on stratification outcomes, but it is also a more consequential predictor of occupation and income than such background characteristics as parents' socioeconomic status. Results are consistent with an interpretation that suggests that the continuing disadvantage that darker blacks experience is due to persisting discrimination against them in the contemporary United States.

Slomczynski, Melvin L. Kohn	American Journal of Sociology	91	3	1985-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 593-615	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Data from both the United States and Poland show that the effect of occupational self-direction on intellective process is similar for younger, middle-aged, and older workers. Multiple-regression analyses of cross-sectional data consistently indicate that the job conditions determinative of occupational self-direction, the substantive complexity of work in particular, have as great an effect on the ideational flexibility and authoritarian conservatism of older as on those of younger and middle-aged workers in both countries. Longitudinal analyses of U.S. data demonstrate that the reciprocal effects of the substantive complexity of work and intellective process are as great for older as for younger workers. All the evidence supports the conclusion that job conditions continue to affect, and be affected by, intellective process with undiminished force throughout adult life.

A formal model specifies mechanisms through which the hierarchical structure of organizations is likely to influence the extent of earnings dispersion. The predictions derived from the model are confronted with data on the pay structure and formal organizational structure of 5,600 Swedish manufacturing establishments. The empirical analyses largely confirm the predictions derived from the model: the extent of earnings dispersion within an organization is closely related to the vertical and horizontal differentiation of its formal structure. This conclusion holds true even when the sex, education, and work experiences of those populating the organizational structures are controlled for.

South, Katherine Trent	American Journal of Sociology	93	5	1988-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1096-1115	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Data for a sample of 117 countries are analyzed to test several hypotheses derived from the Guttentag-Secord theory relating societal-level sex ratios to women's status and roles. The theory implies that high sex ratios, which indicate a relative undersupply of women, will be positively associated with the proportion of women who marry and the fertility rate and negatively associated with women's average age at marriage, rates of divorce and illegitimacy, and female rates of literacy, labor-force participation, and suicide. Although the bivariate correlations between the sex ratio at ages 15-49 and these dimensions of women's roles provide little support for the theory, most of the expected relationships emerge when the level of socioeconomic development, as measured by a multi-item index, is statistically controlled. Additional analyses indicate that the effect of the sex ratio on women's role is more pronounced in developed than in developing countries.

They provide a test for the influence of relatively free labor versus racial minority statuses. Japanese American assimilation, pluralism, and subordination are assessed with census data and with generation-specific surveys by the Japanese American Research Project. Assimilation trends in language, residence, primary relations, exogamy, and socioeconomic status affirm parallels with voluntary European immigrants. Continuing pluralism is indicated in value systems, family relations, and community participation. However, ratio indicators confirm that racial subordination persists, even among highly educated, professional Japanese Americans.

Concepts and algorithms are demonstrated in five case studies involving up to 100 persons and up to eight types of tie, over as many as 15 time periods. In each case the model identifies a concrete social structure. Role and position concepts are then identified and interpreted in terms of these new models of concrete social structure. Part II, to be published in the May issue of this Journal (Boorman and White 1976), will show how the operational meaning of role structures in small populations can be generated from the sociometric blockmodels of Part I.

The seriousness of the existing criticisms makes it useful to reassess Gamson's Strategy. This article first reviews the critical literature on Strategy and discusses Gamson's response to his critics. Second, the article reports the results of several analyses of the data set obtained by using the best statistical procedures available for assessing the relative importance of organizational and environmental variables and analyses of the major concerns raised by Gamson's critics and his response to them. The results suggest that displacement and group factionalism are the major predictors of protest group success. Implications of the analysis are discussed.

It investigates the effects of competitive processes and environmental effects on this rate. A number of stochastics models embodying different assumptions about the ecology of foundings are estimated. The best-fitting models posit that the effect of density (the number of unions in existence) and the number of recent foundings on the foundig rate is curvilinear. Analysis of more complicated models reveals that the growth of industrial unions inhibited the founding rate of craft unions. However, the founding rate of industrial unions was unaffected by the number of craft unions in existence.

Particularly promising here is "dual exchange theory," as represented in Ekeh's elaboration of Levi-Strauss's conception of elementary exchange. Using data from a small-scale ethnographic study of social network mobilization among low-income black women in the event of job loss, this paper investigates two tenets of dual exchange theory: (1) informal support exchanges in natural settings take the form of "generalized" and "restricted" exchange, and (2) generalized exchange systems are associated with greater degrees of solidarity and social support. The data support the dual exchange thesis, with some modification of Ekeh's dichotomized conceptualization of exchange. The Study reinforces the utility of network analysis and exchange concepts in the analysis of social support.

Morse	American Journal of Sociology	89	6	1984-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1347-1378	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The hypothesis that IQ is an important variable in explaining delinquent behavior among juveniles is examined theoretically and empirically. From a structuralist perspective, delinquent behavior is a consequence of social institutional practices, rather than of individual characteristics. The correlation of IQ with delinquency is not because IQ exerts any casual influence on delinquent behavior but because, in certain institutional settings (the schools), it may be selected by the institution as a criterion for differential treatment. Changes in institutional practices produce a change in the relationship between IQ and delinquency. Empirically, the variables in the structuralist model developed by the Office of Youth Development explain over 20% of the variance in serious and nonserious delinquency. The variables used in the IQ-delinquency hypothesis, a model based on individual characteristics instead of on institutional practices, explain less than 5% of the variation in serious and nonserious delinquent behavior. The conclusion is that the IQ-delinquency hypothesis contributes nothing to existing delinquency theory.

The linear models shows some decline across cohorts in the effects of background on years of schooling; the logistic response model, used to estimate the effects of background variables on specific grade progression probabilities, shows remarkable constancy over time. These results are consistent with an image of the educational system as an ever-expanding pie that is always sliced in the same proportions.

Garnier	American Journal of Sociology	91	2	1985-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 250-280	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Through an analysis of a large survey of employment men and women in France, this article shows that French reproduction theory has overstated the role of education in reproducing class advantage from generation to generation. Among men, reproduction of control over labor power (i.e., managerial/supervisory positions) is primarily direct instead of indirect through education. At the same time, education plays no role in reproducing ownership of businesses (i.e., capitalist and petty bourgeois positions), and there is little tendency for capitalist or petty bourgeois fathers to convert their economic capital into the educational capital for their sons so that the sons can secure managerial positions. Education serves less as a reproducer of class advantage than as a vehicle of mobility into managerial positions. Although reproduction theory has tended to ignore gender differences in class reproduction , these are found to be substantial. In the reproduction of ownership, women are less likely than men to inherit a business from their father. In the reproduction of control over labor power, the considerations that are important to men's chances of acquiring managerial/supervisory positions are generally much less important to women's chances. Thus reproduction strategis that are succesful in perpetuating class privilege for men do not work as well for women.

Correlation analysis suggests that women do not currently organize all sex-role attitudes along a single dimension, although their outlook toward the sex-based familial division of labor is supported by beliefs about the needs of children and women. Regression analysis of attitudes in relation to personal characteristics suggests that attitudes are at least partly based on group norms or values.

This paper describes a practical method for sampling average acquaintance volume (the average number of people known by each person) from large populations and derives confidence limits on the resulting estimates. It is shown that this average figure also yields an estimate of what has been called "network density." Applications of the procedure to community studies, hierarchical structures, and interorganizational networks are proposed. Problems in developing a general theory of network sampling are discussed.

Jackman	American Journal of Sociology	86	3	1980-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 604-617	The University of Chicago Press	fla		A common approach to the explanation of growth rates in crossnational research employs a first-difference (or panel) model. However, when the basic variables employed in such a model are badly skewed, the estimated disturbances are likely to be heteroscedastic. When this happens, the parameter estimates become inefficient, and conventional tests of their statistical significance are biased. This research note briefly reviews the problem, suggests a remedy, and draws on two recent empirical studies of the economic growth of nations to illustrate the substantive importance of the issues involved.

Gove	American Journal of Sociology	87	1	1981-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 48-74	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This study is an examination of the effects of living alone on mental health, mental well-being, and maladaptive behaviors. The findings may be summarized in three basic points. First, there is no evidence that persons who live alone are selected into that living arrangement because of preexisting psychological problems, noxious personality characteristics, or incompetent socioeconomic behavior. Second, contrary to what would be predicted by structural functionalism or symbolic interactionism, the data analysis in this study shows that unmarried persons who live alone are in no worse, and on some indicators are in better, mental health than unmarried persons who live with others. Furthermore, divorced and never-married persons who live alone have more in common with married persons, in terms of their mental health characteristics, than do such persons who live with others. Third, unmarried persons who live alone show a slight tendency to be more likely to engage in maladaptive behaviors such as drug and alcohol use than are unmarried persons who live with others. These findings have implications for our thinking about the effects of social integration on mental health; the results raise the posibility that socially integrated relationships which provide not only (1) direct social rewards through reinforcement and increased meaning in life but also (2) regulation of behavior through mechanisms of social constraint, obligation, and responsibility, may entail not only rewards but also costs. For persons who live in socially integrated relationships, if the decrements to mental health produced by social regulation are not balanced by social rewards through some as yet unknown process, such social integration may help create psychological distress.

Strictness makes organizations stronger an more attractive because it reduces free riding. It screens out members who lack commitment and and stimulates participation among those who remain. Rational choice theory thus explains the success of sect, cults, and conservative denominations without recourse to assumptions of irrationality, abnormality, or misinformation. The theory also predicts differences between strict and lenient groups, distinguishes between effective and counterproductive demands, and demonstrates the need to adapt strict demands in response to social change.

Although only a minority of people have any "family neighbors," such people often have a central role in community social networks. Analysis of survey results from one metropolitan region demonstrates that much of the effect of many common predictors of neighboring (such as lenght of residence in the community, income, and urban/rural location) is indirect, through their effect on the number of family neighbors. Implications for the theoretical interpretation of these predictors are discussed.

This trend is related to the rising proportion of workers who have college degrees. Origin status effects destination status among workers who do not have bachelor's degrees, but college graduation cancels the effect of background status. Therefore, the more college graduates in the work force, the weaker the association between origin status and destination status for the population as a whole. Overall mobility remains unchanged because a decline in structural mobility offsets the increased openness of the class structure. Upward mobility still exceeds downward mobility in the 1980s but by a smaller margin than it did in the 1960s and 1970s.

The political economy framework is applied to juvenile courts and used to generate hypotheses about the organizational determinants of their input and output decisions, as signified by the proportion of cases that are judicially handled and the rate of commitment. The hypotheses are tested on data collected in a national survey of juvenile courts. The empirical results indicate that the external political economy significantly influences the court's input decisions but that the internal political economy is inadequate in explaining either the input or the output decisions. The findings suggest that the political economy perspective is mostly effective in explaining court decisions that are visible to the organizational environment.

This paper argues that these differences persist because they are constantly generated anew. Innovations emerge in metropolitan centers and diffuse from them to smaller places, so that there is always a gap between the two. Predictions from this model are evaluated with poll data, covering 20 years, on changing social attitudes. The results are consistent with the predictions. Patterns in the rates of opinion change indicate d hierarchical diffusion model in which early adoption and/or rate of diffusion are positively associated with community size.

Political resource models of welfare effort fare well when tested with pooled time-series data for 1960-82. Use of governmental authority by the left, use of disruption by the working class and the petty burgeois, and use of lobbying, voting, and/or entitlement rights by the elderly and the unemployed constitute means of political action. Among more diffusely available "infraresources," state revenue expansion, economic growth, and inflation appear to buoy welfre expansion, as do left corporatism and "bureaucratic paternalism." Some mediating effects of economic epoch and state structure are explored.

Beck	American Journal of Sociology	102	3	1996-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 788-815	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article considers what effect lynchings in one location had on lynchings elsewhere. The "contagion" model predicts that lynchings in one area increased the probability of lynchings in nearby areas, while the "deterrence" model expects the probability of lynchings in a given locale to decline when lynchings occurred elsewhere. County-level data for 10 southern states yield strong evidence of a negative spatial effect for three time periods (1895-99, 1905-9, and 1915-19) consistent with the deterrence model. Two interpretations for this spatial effect are: (1) whites were satisfied that local blacks were sufficiently threatened by nearby lynchings; (2) blacks altered their behavior to minimize conflict with local whites.

The comparisons of occupational conditions reveal a tendency for work in Japan to be done in a way in which consensus is promoted and individual responsibility avoided. The central result of the analysis of the reciprocal effects of occupational conditions and psychological functioning is the generalization to Japan of American findings on the effects of occupational self-direction. In Japan, as in the United States, occupational self-direction leads to ideational flexibility and self-directed orientation to self and society. Other results center on the more extensive relationship in Japan between position in the work organization and psychological functioning. The pervasiveness of this relationship provides evidence for those who emphasize the importance of the organization for the Japanese worker. The organizational effects that were found (e.g., the increase in self-esteem and authoritarian conservatism resulting from ownership, high hierarchical level, and bureaucratization) reflect patterns of Japanese culture and organizational functioning.

The usual strategy is to ask many such questions and to select the best ones for further analysis or scaling. Unfortunately, the common methods for selecting the best items are based almost exclusively on the correlations among the items themselves. Such methods cannot be counted on to select substantively meaningful and stable subsets of items, because they ignore the relationships of the items to other theoretically relevant variables. This paper suggests a few techniques that researchers might use in order to take such relationships into account and, consequently, to create more useful and meaningful scales of attitude items.

Farley	American Journal of Sociology	93	3	1987-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 688-700	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Previous studies have reported a positive relationship between the degree of suburbanization of a metropolitan area and central-city crime rates. Two competing explanations of this relationship, one based on relative deprivation in cities as compared with suburbs and the other attributing the relationship to suburb-to-city movements of crime participants, have been offered. The present study, based on regression analysis of 1980 census data, finds a relative deprivation effect on two crimes in cities as compared with suburbs, but, even when relative deprivation is controlled, the suburbanization-crime relationship persists. The participant-movement explanation, on the other hand, is found to involve unrealistic assumptions about the movements of offenders. It is proposed that the unexplained part of the relationship between suburbanization and central-city crime is an arbitrary product of the effect of the city suburb boundary location on the denominator of the crime rate. It is demonstrated that such an effect can occur even in the absence of any movement of offenders between suburb and city.

The procedures and results of these epidemiological studies of "true" prevalence are analyzed with respect to several questions: Are total rates over all types of functional disorder higher among males or among females? Which types of disorder are more prevalent among males and which among females? How do sex differences in overall rates and in different types of disorder vary over time? What are the implications of the findings for theory about sex roles and psychiatric disorder?

Heckathorn	American Journal of Sociology	94	3	1988-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 535-562	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Social psychologists, sociologists, and economists have all proposed theories of norm emergence. In general, they views norm emergence as depending on three factors: (i) actors' preferences regarding their own behavior (inclinations); (ii) actors' preferences regarding the behavior of others (regulatory interests); and (iii) measures for enforcing norms (enforcement resources), such as access to sanctions and information. Whereas most studies of norm emergence have focused on inclinations or enforcement resources, this article analyzes the role of regulatory interests in norm emergence. Specifically, it analyzes systems of collective sanctions in which, when and individual violates or complies with a rule, not merely the individual but other memgers of that person's group as well are collectively punished of rewarded by an external agent. These collective sanctions give individuals an incentive to regulate one another's behavior. This paper demonstrates that when a group is subjected to collective sanctions, a variety of responses may be rational: the group may either create a secondary sanctioning system to enforce the agent's dictates, or it may revolt against the agent to destroy its sanctioning capacity. According to the proposed theoretic model. the optimal response depends quite sensitively on the group's size, internal cohesion, and related factors.

Clemens	American Journal of Sociology	98	4	1993-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 755-798	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Although social movements are often presumed to cause change, the dominant theoretical accounts lead to the opposite conclusion. To explain how challenging movements do produce institutional change, this article introduces the concept of organizational repertoires. Groups marginalized by existing political institutions have an incentive to develop alternative models of organization. These alternative models, in turn, are more likely to be adopted by other political actors to the extent that they embody familiar, but previously nonpolitical, forms of organization. This argument is illustrated with an analysis of political innovation by women's groups in the United States at the trun of the century.

Fararo, John Skvoretz	American Journal of Sociology	92	5	1987-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1183-1209	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The synthesis of discrete theories and principles to generate ever more comprehensive and unified general theory is fundamental to theoretical science. This paper, after introducing the authors' conception of what such a process involves, combines two structural theories: Blau's macrosociological, social differentiation theory and Granovetter's strength-of-weak-ties principle. Each was previously formalized within a common biased-net mathematical framework. These two formalizations are integrated within a single approach to the study of social relations. Blau's theory is associated with quantities such as heterogeneity, consolidation, and a bias parameter pertaining to homophily. Granovetter's principle is formalized in terms of another bias parameter pertaining to the likelihood of relational closure in triads. A concluding discussion examines empirical literature on diffusion processes to see if hypotheses implied by the unified theory are supported by evidence.

The analysis challenges some longheld views about the putative smooth course of passage throught the life course in "simple" societies and troubled transitions in the United States. Despite the contrasting societal contexts, in both types of society transitions constitute immanent sources of tension: for the individual, conflicts between old and new roles and for the society, competition for rewarding roles. But in both contexts mechanisms emerge that serve to mitigate some transition difficulties. Even the processes of transition themselves are subject to change as a result of individual and societal adaptations to transitional problems and to social and environmental change. Some theoretical implications of these findings are explored.

The consensus perspectives assumes that the legal order reflects social consensus and that the size of crime control bureaucracies is a response to reported infractions of that order (reported crime rates). The conflict perspectives assumes that the legal order reflects the interests of the powerful and that the size of crime-control bureaucracies is a response to perceived threats to such interests. Work by Turk and Blauner suggests that the size of crime-control bureaucracies reflects the relative size of groups dissimilar to authorities and the extent to which such groups are segregated. The above perspectives are tested for 109 U.S. municipal police departments from 1950 to 1972. Empirical support for the conflict perspective is strongest (1) in the South and (2) after the civil disorders of the 1960s.

A Meadian distinction between brain as a neurological phenomenon and mind as a sociological one is introduced to examine such a claim. Software approaches to AI avoid the problem of modeling the human brain, but, because they require thorough and unambiguous instructions, they cannot model how human brains understand external reality. Hardware approaches to AI, such as parallel data-processing models, do attempt to model the brain but only in an engineering sense: in substituting procedures for meaning, they again fail to account for how human brains, let alone human minds, work. The hypothesis of human distinctiveness, consequently, is not rejected, but expanded and elaborated. The actual results of work in AI support interpretative trends in sociological theorizing rather than system-oriented ones.

The anomie potentially generated by unanticipated affluence, a more central concern for Durkheim, is discussed by way of contrast. A tentative typology of deviant adaptation is constructed utilizing questions of (a) commitment to approved cultural goals and (b) the degree to wich achievement of substantial progress toward such goals is realized. It is suggested that this typology might be particularly effective in the understanding of deviance at higher socioeconomic levels. The essay also consider implication of Durkheim's underlying model of the human.

This article develops a mathematical model of contagion and applies it to aircraft hijackings in the United States between 1968 and 1972. Analyses show that successful hijackings in the United States did generate additional hijacking attempts of the same type (either transportation or extortion). There were no contagion effects of unsuccessful hijacking attempts in the United States or any effects on U.S. hijacking attempts of such attempts outside the United States.

Carruthers, Wendy Nelson Espeland	American Journal of Sociology	97	1	1991-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 31-69	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article addresses claims made by Weber, Schumpeter, and Sombart concerning the importance of double-entry bookkeeping. They argue that accounting played a key technical role in enhancing rationality and furthering the development of capitalism methods of production. The history of accounting methods and practices from the Middle Ages to the 19th century is surveyed in order to evaluate these arguments. Two important dimensions of accounting are discussed: the rhetorical and the technical. The argument is that, as rethoric, accounting must be understood as an attempt to convince some audience of the legitimacy of business ventures. Goody's analysis of writing and literacy is applied to the development of accounting as a technique. As a practical method, double-entry bookkeeping appears to have increased "rationality," but the rhetorical side of double entry is also critical. The conclusion is that the significance of double-entry bookkeeping can be appreciated only if its rhetorical and technical aspects are considered.

Cohn	American Journal of Sociology	87	5	1982-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1150-1161	The University of Chicago Press	fla		There is an assumed negative relationship between the status of the aged and both the level and the rate of economic development in a society. It is hypothesized that status decline among the aged is caused by their relative displacement from high-status occupational groups. This change in the occupational distributions of age groups results from both a decline in economic activity among the economically active. In a sample of 30 countries, differences are examined in the age concentration of professional-technical and administrative-managerial occupational groups, by both level and rate of economic development. The paper concludes by noting that the evident decline in status of the aged with economic development may be a temporary phenomenon, subject to the dynamic relationship between economic development and the changing age structure of the population.

In this paper we consider the advantages of and procedures of dynamic analysis of event-history data-data givin the number, timing, and sequence of changes in a categorical dependent variable. We argue for grounding this analysis in a continuous-time stochastic model. This permits the data to be fully utilized; it also allows a unified treatment of the various outcomes analyzed in the many approaches that use only part of the information contained in such data. We focus on the familiar continuos-time Markov model, summarize its properties, report its implications for various outcomes, describe extensions to deal with population heterogeneity and time dependence, and outline a maximum-likelihood procedure for estimating the extended model from event-history data. The discussion in illustrated with an empirical analysis of the effects of an income-maintenance experiment on change in marital status. We conclude by contrasting event-history analysis with cross-sectional analysis, event-count analysis, and panel analysis. We find that event-history analysis has substantial advantages over the other approaches.

By applying the methods of latent structure analysis to analyze data on job characteristics obtained in a British national survey, the authors find that, for both the men and women employees considered here, there are underlying latent variables that can explain the observed patterns of the job characteristics that pertain to (1) payment conditions, (2) promotion prospects, and (3) autonomy at work. The article describes how the underlying latent variables associated with the men's job characteristics differ from the corresponding underlying latent variables associated with women's job characteristics.

Traditional resolutions of this paradox are inadequate; the resolution proposed here involves the distinction within the sphere of production between the labor process and the factory regime. By a series of comparisons of textile industries in 19th-century England, United States, and Russia, the article highlights four factors that shape factory regimes: the labor process, market forces, the reproduction of labor power, and the state. It shows how an examination of factory regimes can account for the absorption of working-class radicalism in England after 1850 and the deepening of working-class radicalism in Russia after 1905, culminating in the revolution-ary movements of 1917. Finally, it presents the implications for Marxism of this distintion between the strictly economic elements of production and its political and ideological institutions.

Mesomobilization actors have a dual function: They first provide the structural basis for mobilization by coordinating micromobilization groups and collecting the resources required for action and then try to achieve a cultural integration of the various groups by developing a master frame to interpret the triggering event in a way that is conducive to mobilization. Two empirical cases: the mobilization against U.S. President Roland Reagan's visit in Berlin in 1987 and the mobilization against the yearly meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Berlin in 1988 are investigated to develop hypotheses that indicate what structural and cultural factors are important to a successful mobilization.

It is argued that community characteristics are related to a structure of opportunities and a normative climate which may produce or eliminate ethnic disparities in income. The analysis, based on a socioeconomic model, shows that the ethnic composition of the moshav village has a significant impact on individual modernity and economic performance, even when formal education is controlled for. This compares with a negligible effect of individual ethnicity on these varibles.

Rents are resources that provide advantages for incumbents of social positions that are independent of the characteristics of the incumbents. Inequalities created by rents generate interests in the protection and the acquisition of advantages that can be said to from "objective" interests attached to positions in social structure. Rent, therefore, is the basis for the formation of classes, in the general meaning of conflict groups. The article also discusses rents not located in positions in social structure but based on natural abilities.

The authors argue that under certain circumstances public sector employment helps ethnic minorities attain higher socioeconomic rewards. The findings of the study indicate that Arab employees in Israel receive higher returns to education in the ethnic labor market, compared with the dominant market, and in the public sector rather than the private sector. The latter result also holds true when Arab workers are compared to Jews, revealing the benefits derived from the sheltered labor market.

Steve Rytina	American Journal of Sociology	97	6	1992-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1658-1688	The University of Chicago Press	fla		A new scaling for detailed occupational categories is prepared by extracting a symmetric scaling of intergenerational continuity (SSIC) from a 308 X 308 mobility table derived from the NORC General Social Survey. The resulting SSIC scores are based solely on observed mobility among detailed occupational categories. These scores are quite similar to socioeconomic index (SEI) scores. and somewhat less similar to NORC occupational prestige scores. The SSIC values closely match average offspring's SEIs and average father's SEIs for each category, although no information about SEI or its components is employed in their calculation. This fundamentalist approach to measuring inheritance without a priori scaling reveals that mediation of occupational inheritance by education is outweighed by direct "ascriptive" transmission.

The study focuses on careers in the U.S. civil service from 1963 to 1977, using official personnel records on a 1% sample of whitecollar federal employees, along with secondary survey data. The career is viewed as an outcome not only of individual attributes but also of both organizational and historical contexts. The empirical strategy used to disentangle the individual, organizational, and historical effects is cohort analysis. Five successive entering cohorts are differentiated, and for each a model of socioeconomic achievement is estimated which corporates key characteristics of bureaucratic labor markets not heretofore considered in such models. The considerable power of the model to account for variations in occupational prestige and salary supports a Weberian view of bureaucratic labor markets a highly rationalized personnel systems, although ascriptive characteristics also affect career success in the federal service. The cohort analysis reveals important organizational and historical effects which are interpreted as demonstrating the influence of variations in opportunity structure on socioeconomic achievement. The paper concludes with a call for greater sociological attention to the interrelationship of individual biography and societal history.

The newspapers' different narrative constructions affected the selection and interpretation of significant crisis events, shaped social expectations about how the crisis would be resolved, and constrained the range of symbolic strategies available to local political elites. Through and application of narrative methods, this case demonstrates how the analysis of plot, character, and genre can help explain the interplay between the analytic and concrete forms of culture and the dynamics of social problems and social change more broadly.

Bassis	American Journal of Sociology	82	6	1977-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1318-1326	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Using longitudinal data from a national survey of college freshmen, this paper is an effort to determine the dimensions of the comparative reference group that students employ when evaluating their own academic competence. On the basis of data which reveal that college selectivity has a modest but significant impact on self-evaluation change during the freshman year, it is reasoned that the comparative reference group that students employ is not specific to their own institution. Rather, with at least some sense of the selectivity of their own school relative to that of others, students apparently evaluate themselves relative to the full range of undergraduates across colleges. These findings are contrasted, both theoretically and empirically, with those of previous investigations.

At the present time, however, there is scarcely any agreement about the status of the book's argument among all those who still appeal to the volume. After 50 years, the vast scholarship generated by Structure is in disarray, with separate literatures existing for different aspects of the book and controversies present in all these literatures. This paper examines each major aspect of Structure: its (1) sociohistorical context, (2) writing style, (3) methodological argument, (4) account of the history of social theory, (5) analysis of action, (6) view of the social world, (7) perspective on the actor, (8) treatment of the problem of order, and (9) approach to voluntarism. The paper argues that, when Structure is embedded in the sociointellectual context where it was produced, and is interpreted as a "charter" intended to defend the science of sociology against forces such as behaviorism and neoclassicism, the separate features of its argument come together to allow the resolution of many of the controversies that surround the book and to facilitate the integration of much of the previous scholarship. This interpretation locates the achievement and the critical limitations of Structure in Talcott Persons's tendency to universalize the particular ideas that served to advanced the immediate aims of his charter for sociology.

Using black and white women surveyed by the 1970 National Fertility Study, I completely decomposed the variance in fertility jointly explained by race and education to examine the from of the interactive relationship among the three variables. No support for the minority-status theory was found. The implications for future research are explored.

Messner	American Journal of Sociology	88	5	1983-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 997-1007	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the thesis of a "subculture of violence" by examining the realtinships among region, racial composition, and the homicide rate for a sample of 204 Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSAs). The subcultural thesis has been partly discredited by previous studies based on samples of the American States. These studies report no effect of either region or racial composition on the homicide rate once socioeconomic and democraphic variables have been statistically controlled. My results for SMSAs, however, are quite different. Both southern region and racial composition exhibit appreciable partial effects even with theoretically important controls. The analysis also indicates significant interaction between racial composition and region. For SMSAs outside the South, racial compsition is strongly related to the homicide rate, whereas for southern SMSAs there is no significant relationship between these variables. The paper concludes with some suggestions for future on the subcultural thesis.

Nelson	American Journal of Sociology	95	3	1989-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 616-658	The University of Chicago Press	fla		A pivotal issue in sociological theories of labor markets, as well as legal and policy debates on pay equity, is the relative importance of market and organizational forces in determining pay differences between jobs held predominantly by men and those held predominantly by women. This article develops two models of the market organization relationship-an administered-efficiency model and a bureaucratic-politics model. Quantitative analyses of individual and job-level data in a state government pay system indicate that the administered efficiency model does not adequately explain malefemale earnings differences. Documentary, testimonial, and interview data strongly suggest the significance of bureaucratic politics in the pay-determination process. We conclude that market forces influence wage rates but are heavily mediated by organizational factors unrelated to efficiency considerations in the type of organization studied here.

It entails four stages in the acquisition of a role: anticipatory, formal, informal, and personal. Each stage is discussed in terms of the variety of sources, content, and forms of expectations present, as well as the degree of consensus on the expectations and individuals' reactions to them. It is suggested that the acquisition of roles involves passage through all four stages. Implications of the formulation for sociological and psychological research regarding role acquisition are offered.

Reilly	American Journal of Sociology	87	1	1981-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 143-156	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The importance of marriage timing for educational attainment is examined for a national sample of young men and women. In attempting to deal with technical deficiencies in earlier research on this issue, we distinguish schooling obtained prior to marrying from that obtained afterward and adjust both measures for the age-grading of school enrollment patterns. We focus on the implications of marriage timing for schooling obtained after one marries. We conclude that marrying early is detrimental to the educational attainments of women but of little or no consequence for men. We also demonstrate that formulations of the age at marriage-educational attainment relationship similar to those employed in other studies would have led to quite different conclusions.

They have posited a special propensity for black offenders to seek out white victims because of black rage and have pointed to the desirable characteristics of white victims. In this paper, three models of the race of offender and victim are developed using aggregate national data on homicide (from the Uniform Crime Reports), rape, aggravated assault, simple assault, and robbery (from the National Crime Surveys.) Whatever measures are used, violent crimes are found to be intraracial to a far greater extent than statistically expected under these models. A structural explanation of these findings is presented.

While his metatheoretical critique of utilitarian social theory, which was closely intertwined with his analysis of the division of labor, is still persuasive, his causal explanation of the division of labor is questionable wherever it modifies the earlier body of thought. Ironically, it was his metatheoretical concerns expressed in the critique of utilitarian social theory that flawed his contributions to a causal explanation of social differentiation.

Forms of interfaces range from a long-term, exclusive tie (the relationship interface) to many short-lived, episodic ties (the transaction interface), with hybrid forms between the two poles. Contrary to widespread belief, the article finds that strong relationships still exist. Transactions interfaces are rare. Most firms use hybrid interfaces. A firm's interface is conceptualized as the intentional result of its efforts to reduce dependence and exploit power advantages. Observed interfaces are shown to be related systematically to various power-dependence concepts, including resource intensity (number of transactions and dollar amounts raised), criticality (the availability of resource alternatives), power asymmetry between a firm and its main bank, organization size, standardization of exchange, and the use of tandem strategies (director interlocks).

Loxley	American Journal of Sociology	88	6	1983-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1162-1194	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Most previous research on effects of schooling has concluded that the effect of school or teacher quality on academic achievement is less than that of family background or other characteristics of students that predate entry into school. However, the evidence for that generalization is derived mainly from a few of the world's school systems (mostly in Europe, North America, and Japan). This paper explores diverse influences on pupil achievement in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. Children who attend primary school in countries with low per capita incomes have learned substantially less after similar amounts of time in school than have pupils in high income countries. At the same time, the lower the income of the country, the weaker the influence of pupils' social status on achievement. Conversely, in low-income countries, the effect of school and teacher quality on academic achievement in primary school is comparatively greater. From these data, which are more representative of the world's population of schoolchildren than those used in previous studies, it is possible to conclude that the predominant influence on student learning is the quality of the schools and teachers to which children are exposed.

Liker	American Journal of Sociology	88	2	1982-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 241-269	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Economic change represents a major theoretical source of changing health states in populations and among individuals. The most impressive empirical documentation of this link at the aggregate level has come from time-series analyses. Studies at the individual level have begun to specify the causal elements in such relations, with emphasis on the variable health outcomes of economic deprivation. Specifying the duration of effect, however, requires longitudinal data. Such studies are still rare in the field and most are too limited in time span to test duration hypotheses. Using one of the oldest known achieves of longitudinal data, this study examines the consequences of the Great Depression experiences of middle-and working-class women for their well-being in old age, 40 years later. Adaptations to human and material loss in the 1930s varied widely by social class, reflecting the greater severity of economic stress and the greater resource disadvantage of working-class families. With health measurements before the Depression and some 40 years later, the results show consistently adverse effects of economic loss for working-class women and benign outcomes among women of higher status. These long-term implications of decremental change point to the need for greater understanding of the life course in studies of the interplay of social history and life history.

Mossel	American Journal of Sociology	91	3	1985-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 650-673	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article develops simple structural equation models of the regression of occupational status on schooling in a sample of 518 Wisconsin high school graduates and their brothers. The models correct for response variability and incorporate a family variance component structure. Methodological complications follow from the facts that the sample consists of sibling pairs; that members of a cohort of high school graduates, rather than their families, are the sampling units; and that the primary respondents are informants about some of the characteristics of their brothers. The regression of occupational status on educational attainment is relatively insensitive both to response variability and to the specification of common family factors. Family membership accounts for about half the variance in schooling and more than one-third of the variance in occupational standing, but there is little evidence that failure to control family background leads to upward bias in estimates of the effect of schooling on occupational status.

It must also be renewed; that is, vacancies must be filled. A system of migrant labor is characterized by the institutional differentiation and physical separation of the processes of renewal and maintenance. Accordingly, migrant labor entails a dual dependence upon employment in one place and an alternate economy and/or state in another. In addition, the separation of migrant workers from their families is implied. It is enforced through specific legal and political mechanisms which regulate geographical mobility and impose restrictions on the occupational mobility of migrants. These mechanisms in turn are made possible by the migrant workers'powerlessness in the place of employment, in the labor market, and under the legal and political systems where they are employed. One consequence of a system of migrant labor is the externalization, to an alternate economy and/or state, of certain costs of labor-force renewal-costs normally borne by the employer and/or state of employment. This framework is developed and applied to migrant farm workers in California and migrant mine workers in South Africa. The differences between the two systems are highlighted and analyzed in terms of the broader features of the respective social structures. Finally, the implications of the theoretical scheme are discussed and extended to an interpretation of race relations.

This examination of the connections between biology and sociology illuminates a process whereby new scientific knowledge is generated, new scientific communities are formed, and individuals become scientists. These relationships were arranged around the negotiable boundaries between the social and the natural in 20th-century science. This process is examined through an analysis of scientific texts, metaphor transaction in science, and mentoring practices that reveal the transmission and bounding of knowledge and authority.

This article resolves inconsistent and provides new insights by constructing a general framework relating law's legitimacy to the mix of legal and scientific rationalities in law. Consistent with dualistic visions of structure as both rules/schemas and resources, the theory specifies how competing legal and scientific rule/resource sets shape action and produce order and change through conflict in and over legal institutions. The theory's guiding orientations illuminate legitimacy processes, order, and change in other institutions including the economy, the polity, and education.

If so, How? Data on the occurrence of conflicts and of violence against various ethnic or racial groups in the 81 largest cities, 1880-1914, show that the growth of the union movement and the rising supply of low-wage labor increased levels of ethnic competition in urban labor markets, thus raising rates of ethnic comflict. The findings support the argument that ethnic conflict and labor unrest are parallel forms of collective action and that each depends on the number and foundings of national labor unions. The effect of labor union organization is strongest for all attacks on blacks. In addition, sharp increases in immigration, a downturn in economic fortunes, and contagion processes all raise rates of ethnic conflict.

Eaton	American Journal of Sociology	86	1	1980-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 149-158	The University of Chicago Press	fla		A simple formal model of the selection of schizophrenics into social classes is developed, based on stochastic models of the process of occupational mobility. The model is estimated with data from England. Two predictions of the model are tested with data: the magnitude of the class differential in rate of schizophrenia at equilibrium, and the pattern of rates for classes in advantaged and disadvantaged ethnic groups. The model approximates the data in both tests. The major conclusion is that selection and drift together form a sufficient explanation for the class differential in rate of schizophrenia.

Lincoln	American Journal of Sociology	94		1988-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. S121-S153	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper extends research on the structural sources of economic inequality by investigating the individual level, organizational, and industrial determinants of earnings in a sample of U.S. and Japanese manufacturing employees. The analysis-based on data collected from 98 plants in seven manufacturing industries in the United States and Japan and from over 8,000 of their managers, supervisors, and workers-provides strong evidence that work structures operating at multiple levels generate inequality in individuals' earnings. Moreover, a number of important and quite striking differences are found in the process of earnings determination in the United States and Japan. For example, American manufacturing employees' earnings are shaped heavily by job characteristics, positions in the authority hierarchy, and (for workers) union representation. The earnings of Japanese employees are conditioned more by "life-cycle" variables such as aged and by the organizational structures and processes associated with firm internal labor markets-seniority, promotions, and internal training.

In particular, we discuss (a) embeddability, or how to determine whether observations on an empirical process could have arisen via the evolution of a continuous-time Markov structure; and (b) identification, or what to do if the observations are consisten with more than one continuous-time Markov structure. With respect to the latter topic, we discuss how to select the specific structure from the list of alternatives which should be associated with the empirical process. We point out that the issues of embeddability and identification are especially pertinent to modeling empirical processes when one has available only fragmentary data and when the observations contain "noise" or other sources of error. These characteristics, of course, describe the typical work situation of sociologists. Finally, we note the type of situation in which a continuous-time model is the proper structure to employ and indicate that issues analogus to the ones we describe here apply to modeling social processes with discrete-time structure.

A final section analyzing developments in professional ethics in America since 1900 specifies the interplay of the three processes hypothesized in the competing perspectives.

Interracial contact is more common than it was during the late 1960s, specially for whites, but still consists primarily of brief, superficial encounters. For whites, the quantity and quality of contact with blacks are determined primarily by propinquity. For blacks, pace of residence matters less, and early childhood experiences matter more.

McClain	American Journal of Sociology	87	5	1982-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1090-1112	The University of Chicago Press	fla		A new conceptual framework for explaining physician distribution and forecasting regional physician supply is presented. Unlike existing efforts at explaining physician distribution, which rely on models of individual physicians making choices regarding location of practice (e.g., economic and psychological models), this paper develops an environmental selection model which views populations of physicians as the unit of analysis and identifies the environmental conditions under which these populations grow and decline. Nine dimensions of the environment affecting populations of physicians are described and hypotheses regarding the effect of four dimensions-residential population size, density, growth, and health system development are pooled cross-sectional and time-series data for counties in New York state. A modified generalized least-squares routine is used to estimate the coefficients. Results reveal substantial support for fundamental aspects of the model: a carrying capacity varying with density of resources, a finite response rate to deviations from carrying capacity, and differential selection of specialists and generalists.Future work should generate simultaneous differential equations estimating the extent to which generalists and specialists compete or cooperate in their efforts to provide services to residential populations.

The concept of social "embeddedness" provides a suitable theoretical umbrella, although in analyzing its specific manifestations, the article focuses on the concept of social capital. The various mechanism through which social structures affect economic action are identified and categorized and their consequences,positive and negative, highlighted. The propositions that summarize the different parts of the discussion attempt to move these concepts beyond sensitizing generalities to hypothesis-like statements that can guide future research.

This fact has been used to criticize social theories of crime causation, to provide the foundation for other theories, to justify recent emphases on career criminals, and to support claims of superiority for longitudinal designs in criminological research. In the present paper, we argue that the age distribution of crime is sufficiently invariant over a broad range of social conditions that these uses of the age distribution are not justified by available evidence.

Bose	American Journal of Sociology	83	2	1977-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 403-424	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Status-attainment and organizations literatures are integrated to develop a model of intraoccupational wage attainment using opensystems theory of organizations to specify structural parameters of the wage-attainment process. We analyze the effects of personal characteristics and organization structure on wages of retail clerks within one labor market. While sex and marital status show wage effects in dependent of work context, the data support our contention that work rountinization and organization dependence on environmental segments determine to a significant degree wage variation at the occupational level. Findings of sex segregation across and within firms and substantial interaction in the effects of sex and organizational variables on wages further specify the relationship among personal characteristics, organization structure, and wages. Our research suggests that organizational contexts influence wages independently of individual characteristics and of labor market factors and tha the inclusion of organization parameters in status-attainment models will prove-fruitful.

Sobel, Michael Hout, Otis Dudley Duncan	American Journal of Sociology	91	2	1985-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 359-372	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Previous attempts to related the traditional concepts of exchange and structural mobility to parameters of the log linear model have been flawed. This article reformulated these concepts; introduces a new, more general conceptual distinction between reciprocated and unreciprocated mobility; and matches the concepts of structure and exchange to parameters of the model of quasi symmetry (QS). Specifically, if exchange or reciprocated mobility is defined as that part of the mobility process that results from equal flows between pairs of occupational categories, and if structural mobility is defined as an effect of marginal heterogeneity that operates uniformly on origins, then (if QS or any special case of QS holds) there is a correspondence between the parameter of the model and the concepts of structure and exchange. Furthermore, this correspondence can be used to develop meaningful parametric (as opposed to ad hoc) indexes of structural mobility. However, if QS fails to hold, there is at best a partial correspondence between the concepts of structure and exchange and the parameters of any multiplicative model. Data from Brazil, Great Britain, and the United States are used to illustrate the article's approach.

The authors report three findings. First, wage differences at the occupation-establishment level were small even without controls for individual-level characteristics. Hence, within-job wage discrimination was much less important than occupation-establishment segregation for observed wage differences. Second, establishment segregation was an important cause, although not as important as occupational segregation, of wage differences. Third, establishment segregation was extensive, as was occupational segregation.

The authors find evidence that a systematic latent structure of intergenerational exchange characterizes the giving and receiving of support. Overall, one-half of Americans do not routinely engage in giving or receiving relationships with their parents and only about one in 10 are engaged in extensive exchange relationships. Parents are assisted more often in situations of poor health, and more often receive assistance when they have young children. Assistance in time of need is not uniform and is rarely extensive. Intergenerational assistance is constrained by family structure and the needs and resources of each generation. African-Americans are consistently less likely than whites to be involved in intergenerational assistance. In each generation, men receive as much altruistic support as women; higher levels of giving and receiving of aid among American women are due to their greater involvement in exchange.

The paper examines the introduction of Greenwich Mean Time to Britain, the establishment of the American railway time-zone system, and the almost universal enforcement of the modern international standard-time zone system. The rise of standard time is viewed within the context of (a) the establishment of national and international communication networks following the introduction of railway transportation and telegraphic communication (which explains the need to synchronize different communities and countries with one another) and (b) the rise of rationalism (which is responsible for the dissociation of standard time from nature). The paper also examines the various grounds on which standard time has been opposed, as well as the relevance of the time-zone system to the development of modern Western "organic" ties of interdependence and complementary differentiation.

The link between differentiation and efficiency advantages involves a number of unsolved problems. In addition, past differentiation theory paid too little attention to actual processes of differentiation theory as well as de-differentiation. Both sets of problems can be tackled better if power constellations and power interests are systematically introduced into the analysis of differentiation and de-differentiation.

Myles	American Journal of Sociology	84	5	1979-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1232-1237	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper reassesses Alford's comparative analyses of class voting in Canada and the United States and updates them to 1976. It is argued that Alford's finding that the class vote in Canada is substantially lower than that in the United States is an artifact of his classification scheme, which incorrectly superimposes the American party structure on Canadian political parties. When Canadian political parties are classified according to the major party/third party division which more accurately reflects the realities of the ``democratic class struggle'' in Canada and when the correct techniques for measuring class voting are applied, it is shown that class voting in the two countries is virtually identical. It is not the level of class voting which distinguishes the two societies but rather the differential manner in which the democratic class struggle in each has been organized as a result of their different electoral systems.

Dobbin	American Journal of Sociology	97	5	1992-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1416-1450	The University of Chicago Press	fla		How did the American system of private, employment-related pension and health insurance arise? Data on corporate fringe-benefit programs during the second quarter of the 20th century contradict the received wisdom that benefits rose in response to wartime federal policy changes and industrial factors. Instead it appears that public policies such as the Wagner Act and Social Security led to union and business support for private insurance, which in turn spurred to growth of fringe benefits. The historical record suggests that neoinstitutional and conflict approaches must be synthesized to explain the expansion of fringe benefits: institutional factors influenced organizational outcomes by affecting interest group goals.

Logan	American Journal of Sociology	82	2	1976-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 333-348	The University of Chicago Press	fla		It is proposed that the process of suburban growth since 1950 has been strongly influenced by the suburbanization of industrial and commercial employment. Suburban communities have responded to the new conditions of growth in ways that create a new pattern of suburban differentiation, one in which there is stratification by both social class and fiscal wealth to the disadvangate of poorer residents. A theoretical model of this growth process is presented and illustrated by the case of cities in a recently growing, industrializin suburban SMSA.

The roughly 4,000 such women included in the National Election Studies of 1952-88 provide an unusual opportunity for testing whether general historical conditions during childhood and adolescence have enduring effects. Despite common claims of cohort effects, some scholars remain skeptical because cohort effects are notoriously difficult to distinguish from age and period effects. Nineteenth Amendment women were in fact less likely to vote in the 1952-88 elections and this gender gap is unique to the amendment cohorts. These results provide strong evidence for the enduring effects of a cohort's historical conditioning.

Faulkner	American Journal of Sociology	97	2	1991-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 279-309	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The theoretical concept of role as resource is introduced and illustrated. The concept combines critical elements of the structural, interactionist, and network approaches to role. A role is a resource in two senses: it is a means to claim, barbain for, and gain membership and acceptance in a social community, and it grants access to social, cultura, and material capital that incumbents and claimants exploit in order to pursue their interests. This article examines the impact of a major transformation-the rise of the blockbuster-on roles and positions in Hollywood filmmaking and discerns two processes underlying the growth and decline of roles in culture production. Through adaptation, filmmakers adopt role combinations with intrinsic capabilities of solving technical and organizational problems. Through imitation, filmmakers copy the role combinations associated with early blockbusters and gain legitimacy in Hollywood's institutional environment. These responses resulted in two fundamental trends: the increasing specialization of the producer and separation of the business and artistic domains, and the increasing fusion of artistic roles.

Recently, Hirschi and Gottfredson have argued that the shape of the age distribution is invariant across social groups and that this shape is unexplained by any known st of sociological variables. They also assert that longitudinal data and models are not necessary to explain delinquency. The present investigation employs longitudinal data on the early life histories of an Israeli male birth cohort to test these assertions and fails to reject them. The shape of the age distribution does not vary sigificantly across ethnic, socioeconomic, and religious orthodoxy groups; nor can it be explained in terms of age variations in marital status, employment, and schooling. However, contrary to Hirschi and Gottfredson's assertion concerning longitudinal data, it is demostrated that in the absence of such data, several parameters of the estimated models would have been biased.

Several problems in previous subculture research are discussed: (1) the confusion between subculture and subsociety, (2) the lack of a meaningful referent for subculture, (3) the homogeneity and stasis associated with the concept, and (4) the emphasis on defining subcultures in terms of values and central themes. It is argued that for the subculture construct to be of maximal usefulness it needs to be linked to process of interaction. Subculture is reconceptualized in terms of cultural spread occurring through an interlocking group network charactarized by multiple group membership, weak ties, structural roles conducive to information spread between groups, and media diffusion. Indentification with the referent group serves to motivate the potential member to adopt the artifacts, behaviors, norms, and values characteristic of the subculture. Youth subculture are presented as illustrations of how these processes operate.

The study concludes that (1) support for racetargeted policies has not changed over birth cohorts, (2) changes in individual characteristics explain only a small portion of the decline in traditional prejudice over birth cohorts, (3) the influence of education on racial attitudes has been increasing over birth cohorts, and (4) percentage black and average per capita income are good predictors of racial attitudes and explain a portion of the North/South gap and the change over time in prejudice.

Ames	American Journal of Sociology	84	6	1979-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1335-1360	The University of Chicago Press	fla		For an experiment on the problem of collective action, randomly selected high school students were randomly assigned to groups which were confronted with an investment opportunity. Each subject could invest resources provided by the experimenter in either a private good, which returned a fixed amount of money to the individual per token invested, or a public good. The public good returned money to the group and, beyond a given provision point, returned much more money per token invested than did the private good. All money from the public good was divided according to a present formula. Thus, subjects could "free ride" on the public good, if other group members invested in it, by taking their share of it and keeping their own resources for themselves. Groups were randomly designated as either large or small, and unequal or equal in the distribution of interest and of resources within the group. Results indicate that the effects of free riding were much weaker than would be predicted from most economic theory. As predicted from the theory, however, small groups containing an individual whose interest in the public good exceeded the cost of its provision (i.e., small, unequal-interest groups) invested more in the public good than any other type of group. No additional significant effects of group size or interest or resource distribution were found.

Feinberg	American Journal of Sociology	90	1	1984-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 168-181	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Several simple mathematical models of affirmative action programs are examined. The models, all of one organization, are derived from the program at issue in the Supreme Court's Weber decision. Contrasts include whether such programs do or do not consider the attrition of black representation, the effects of declining or increasing numbers of positions available, the influence of community educational levels, and the rate of program hiring. The focus is on the time necessary for the program to achieve equality between the racial compositions for the local labor force and that of one occupational group in the organization. The general conclusion is that such programs are slow to promote the desired result of racial equality because of structural inertia. Correlatively, the measure of equality is relatively insensitive to any short-term progress achieved by such programs.

Griffin	American Journal of Sociology	85	4	1980-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 731-768	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper argues that within an economic system class and occupation are conceptually distinct positions. Class refers to control by some positions over others in a production system, and occupation refers to the functional differentiation of positions in a technical division of labor. The effects of measures of class and occupation on both economic and noneconomic rewards are analyzed using data obtained from two national samples of individuals. Class and occupation are found to have independent effects on both types of job rewards, and the commonly used measures of occupational position (Duncan's socioeconomic index [SEI], complexity/skill requirements of the occupation) do not adequately explain inequalities in job rewards associated with occupation. The implications of this analysis for the study of positional inequality in general are indicated.

Goodman	American Journal of Sociology	84	4	1979-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 804-819	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This note shows how some specific models proposed by Duncan (1979), Goodman (1972), Haberman (1974), and Simon (1974), which turn out to be useful for the analysis of occupational mobility tables and other kinds of cross-classification tables, are related to models obtained by applying the general formulations of multiplicative models in Goodman (1972), Darroch and Ratcliff (1972), Darroch and Ratcliff (1972), and Haberman (1974). It also shows how each model can be described in terms of its expected frequencies, or equivalently in terms of its pattern of oddsratios, or equivalently in terms of its pattern of odds. In so doing, it provides (a) further insight into the meaning of some of the specific models, (b) greater flexibility in the possible interpretations of a wide range of potentially useful specific models included within the general class of multiplicative models developed for the analysis of cross-classification tables, and (c) improved methods for estimating the expected frequencies under some of the specific models.

Significant factors include whether the mother was pregnant at marriage, her age at marriage, and her experience with marital disruption and remarriage. The analysis is conducted within an event-history framework that controls for other features of the parental home, including socioeconomic status and religious affilaition. The evidence suggests that the children of mothers who married young and were pregnant at marriage entered into their own marital and nonmarital unions significantly earlier than others. The experience of parental marital dissolution increases children's nonmarital cohabitations but has little effect on their marriages. While no single causal mechanism can easily account for all of the empirical data, the combination of different attitudes toward marriage, nonmarital sex, and cohabitation can account for the empirical findings.

In this article, the sources of variant readings of a single novel ( The Late Bourgeois World, by Nadine Gordimer) are examined. Analysis of published statements (reviews and critical analyses) and comparison of these professional accounts with the author's own "lay" reading highlight the effects of the readers' genders, historical contexts, and purposes for reading on their constructions of the novel's content. The analysis demonstrates the collective character and significance of "novel readings," specially those produced by cultural "outsiders."

Hirsch	American Journal of Sociology	91	4	1986-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 800-837	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Ownership contests for control of large American corporations have become increasingly problematic and public with the advent of the "hostile takeover." This article examines the diffusion of this once "deviant" innovation. Its focus is on the relationship between changing business practices and American business culture; more specifically, on how the processes of the normative framing of hostile takeovers facilitated their diffusion and legitimation, helping to recreate or sustain order despite the disruptions engendered by takeovers. Three eras in the diffusion of this deviant innovation are delineated. Each is characterized by a language and argot that serve to cushion the hard fact of status loss by acquired executives. Neither culture nor social structure is seen here to dominate this interactive process. The provision of incentives to remain within the institution while career goals and pathways are redefined constitutes a case study of institutional reintegration, within a subsystem of society seldom examined from this perspective of changing values and ideologies.

Analysis of data from a cross-section of academic scientists in six different fields indicates that age has a slight curvilinear relationship with both quality and quantity of scientific output. These results are supported by an analysis of a cohort of mathematicians who received their Ph.D.'s between 1974 and 1950. There was no decline in the quality of work produced by these mathematicians as they progressed through their careers. Both the slight decrease in productivity over the age of 50 are explained by the operation of the scientific reward system. By encouraging those scientists who produce the most favorably received work and discouraging those who produce work that is not favorably received, the reward system works to reduce the number of scientists who are actively publishing. Those who continue to publish throughout their careers are a "residue" composed of the best members of their cohort. Increases in productivity through the thirties and into the forties are shown to be a result of command over the resources necessary to be highly productive. In the last part of the paper I examine the hypothesis that it should be easier for young scientists to make important discoveries in the more highly developed or codified sciences than in the less highly developed ones. The data do not support this hypothesis but, rather, suggest that scientists in all six fields are approximately equally likely to make important discoveries shortly after they receive their Ph.D.'s.

These findings imply that education cannot be regarded as an egalitarian influence merely because it is a means to mobility. Comparison of several societies shows them to be almost alike in degree of fraternal similarity in education, although they are interpretably different in fraternal similarity in status and mobility.

Rindfuss	American Journal of Sociology	85	1	1979-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 49-65	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper uses life-table procedures and data from the 1973 Family Growth Survey to ask three basic question: (1) What is the cumulative probabilty that by a given age a child will have experienced a single-parent family as a consequence of marital dusruption? (2) Given a marital disruption, what is the cumulative proportion of children either experiencing parental remarriage or reaching age 18 within a given number of years following disruption? (3) What is the average duration of experience in a single-parent family? Estimates based on the early 1970s suggest that about one-third of all children will spend some time in a single-parent family before age 16 as a consequence of marital disruption (children born between marriages are included in these estimates, but those born before their mother's first marriage are not). There are very large differences by race, education, and the age of the mother at the child's birth. These differences appear in the timing as well as in the prevalence of marital disruption. Of those affected by disruption, one-quarter reach age 18 or their mothers remarry within two years of disruption. Of those affected by disruption, one-quarter reach age 18 or their mothers remarry within two years of disruption; within five years about half are still in a single-parent family. Subgroup differences in remarriage rates lessen differences in the experience of this status by education and age of mother but increase the differences by race.

Briggs	American Journal of Sociology	97	3	1991-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 622-656	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper tests several theories of the rise of factories in 19th century America that differ in their assumptions about (1) the efficiency of early factories relative to artisan shops and (2) the skill, autonomy, and wages of workers in factories. By analyzing data from the manuscript schedules of the Census of Manufactures for Indianapolis in 1850, 1870, and 1880, the authors demostrate the falsity of the neoclassical economic view that factories triumphed in the 19th century because they were more efficient than small-scale, artisan production in their use of labor-saving technologies and new systems of controlling workers. Early factories were no more efficient than artisan shops, and this was due, in part, to their reliance on essentially the same systems of craft production and labor control as those used by shops. The rise of factories was largely the results of a strategy of early factory owners of increasing output and profits, not by using more efficient technologies or systems of labor control, but by adding more workers and more capital.

It is the question of how large-scale social systemic divisions of labor affect the organization and content of primary ties. Network analysis is proposed as a useful approach to the Community Question, because, by focusing on linkages, it avoids the a priori confinement of analysis to solidary groupings and territorial units. Three contentions about the Question are evaluated: arguments that Community is Lost, Saved or Liberted. Data are presented about the structure and use of the "intimate" networks of 845 adult residents of East York, Toronto. Intimate networks are found to be prevalent, composed of both kin and nonkin, nonlocal, asymmetric, and of sparse density. Help in dealing with both emergencies and everyday matters is available from almost all intimate networks, but from only a minority of intimate ties. The data provide broad support for the Liberated argument, in conjunction with some portions of the Saved argument.

This project replicates one of the Wisconsin "social-psychological" models of socioeconomic achievement with 15-year longitudinal data for a national sample of males first sampled in 1955 as high school sophomores and followed up in 1970. Interpersonal and subjective school variables are found to mediate a substantial part of the effects of ability and social origins on later status outcomes, indicating complex processes quite similar to those demonstrated in the original Wisconsin analysis. Minor differences in results between the two inquiries robably reflect differences in sample composition and research design.

Weiss	American Journal of Sociology	89	2	1983-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 350-372	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The decline in labor force participation of aged males experienced by all developed countries can be seen as the result of two kinds of change: (1) economic growth and the need for a young, recently trained labor force has affected the educational system and occupational structure in ways that give young workers a competitive advantage and force older workers out of the labor force at mandatory retirement ages, and (2) government policies have been developed to make retirement more attractive financially and to induce older workers to leave the labor force voluntarily. This paper examines the additive and interactive influence of these two groups of variables using a sample of fix time points (every five years from 1950 to 1975) for 18 relatively developed nations. Models are estimated by using generalized least squares which relate labor force participation of males aged 65 and over to such variables as the size of the agricultural labor force, the old-age dependency ratio, government revenues, social insurance and pension benefits, coverage of the population by pension systems, and the existence of means and retirement tests. The results show dominant effects from the nonpolicy variables that relate to occupational changes in industrial economies and secondary effects from policy-manipulable variables such as pension expenditures that can be changed to increase labor force participation rates and ease the strain on social security systems.

Kubitschek	American Journal of Sociology	90	2	1984-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 326-358	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article examines the growth in probabilities of employment for American men between the ages of 16 and 29. A young man's probability of employment is strongly affected by his other roles, statuses, and activities, and a cohort's employment growth depends on its age distribution of these traits. This article considers two important activities in the lives of young men-school enrollment and enlistment in the armed forces-and examines mechanisms through which these affect employment. The mechanisms include the constraining effect of each activity on the others, the disruptive effects of leaving school or the armend forces-and examines mechanisms through which these affect employment. The mechanisms include the constraining effect of each activity on the others, the disruptive effects of leaving school or the armed forces on finding employment, and the selective retention of men with varying employment prospects by schools and the armed forces. A decomposition of changes in employment between ages 16 and 29-based on a multivariate model of employment, enrollment, and enlistment applied to Current Population Survey and Defense Department data-shows that approximately 80% of employment growth with age can be attributed to these mechanisms. The article discusses the relevance of this analysis to previous research on the early life cicle, to the problem of youth joblessness, and to intercohort changes in youth employment.

With the use of multiple regression, this article examines three theoretical explanations of corporate political strategies. The expectations of corporate liberal theory are not confirmed. Rather, there is support for both state structure and interlock theories. It is argued that, at least in 1980, business political behavior was ideologically conservative, which business understood to represent classwide rational interests.

Baron	American Journal of Sociology	85	4	1980-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 815-839	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Several aspects of Rogoff's classic mobility study (1953) which have influenced subsequent research are reviewed. Recently developed loglinear techniques are used to estimate the "densities" associated with intergenerational occupational moves. A structural model derived empirically from Rogoff's data for Marion County, Indiana, from 1910 to 1940, is applied to an intergenerational mobility matrix from a 1973 national sample, accounting for five-sixths of the baseline association. The results confirm the fundamental invariance of mobility trends documented by previous research. Net mobility patterns apparently reflect a mental-manual division among occupations, with the more "traditional" service sectors and farming falling in between, rather than a hierarchical status dimension.

Land	American Journal of Sociology	86	1	1980-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 90-118	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper presents several macrodynamic social indicator models of post-World War II trends in robbery, burglary, and automobile theft rates for the United States. A theory of the ways in wich changes in criminal opportunity affect these Index Crime property crime rates is deveoped. Definitions and postulates are presented from which we derive a main theorem which states that, other things being equal, a decrease in the density of the population in physical locations that are normally sites of primary groups should lead to an increase in criminal opportunities and hence in property crime rates. Corollaries to the main theorem are presented and tested after operationalization of relevant independent and control variables such as the residential population density ratio, the unemployment rate, age structure, total consumer expenditures, and automobiles per capita. Stochastic difference equations, used to evaluate the theory,indicate that the models implied by the theory exhibit good statistical fit to the recorded property crime rates in question over the 26-year estimation period, 1947-72. In addition, these models provide reasonably accurate expost forecasts of observed annual property crime rates over the five-year forecast period, 1973 through 1977. The paper concludes with a discussion of ex ante forecasted equilibrium levels of the three property crime rates for the mid-1980s implied by the estimated models. The forecasts indicate that the robbery and automobile theft rates should drop00 substantially in the 1980s from their recent levels, whereas the burglary rate may continue to grow or at least drop less.

Wagner, Joseph Berger	American Journal of Sociology	90	4	1985-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 697-728	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Although many observers assume that theoretical progress in sociology has been minimal, there in fact has been considerable growth. Most of the evidence, however, is hidden because sociologists generally (1) fail to differentiate kinds of theoretical activity, (2) focus almost exclusively on growth by means of increasing empirical support, and (3) ignore the variety of theoretical contexts within which growth can occur. Distinguishing among orienting strategies (i.e., metatheoretical frameworks), unit theories (individual theoretical arguments), and theoretical research programs (sets of interrelated theories) helps overcome these obstacles. A focus on programs reveals five types of relations among theories. Three types represent basic forms of theoretical growth; the other two are more specialized forms which usually emerge only in the context of programs based on one of the three basic types. These ideas are first explicated and then applied to several cases of ongoing theoretical activity in sociology. Such cases provide models or exemplars (in the Kuhnian sense) of theoretical growth. Detailed analysis of these exemplars should promote significant growth in other branches of sociology.

Handcock	American Journal of Sociology	101	2	1995-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 302-328	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The recent closing of the gender wage gap is often attributed to increases in women's human capital. This explanation neglects the effect of growing inequality in men's earnings. The authors develop a decomposition that allows them to test how distributional changes in men's and women's earnings combine to yield changes in women's economic status. Using Current Population Survey data from 1967 to 1987, the authors find that the striking polarization in white men's earnings has played a critical role in generating women's relative economic gains, though more for white women than for black women. For both groups, the results predict a future slowing of women's relative progress.

Jacobs	American Journal of Sociology	95	1	1989-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 160-173	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper reexamines long-term trends in occupational segregation by sex, using the double-coded 1900 and 1910 Public Use Samples. The analysis addresses the ambiguity in the measurement of longterm trends that arises from using inconsistent or highly aggregated occupational classifications. The revised measures indicate that occupational segregation by sex remained quite constant from 1900 through 1970, although segregation in nonfarm occupations declined slowly. Occupational sex segregation declined between 1970 and 1980 and continued to decline through 1986. An accurate assessment of historical trends is a necessary starting point for theoretical explanations of occupational sex segregation.

In the capital goods industry the attempt was unsuccessful and generated serious political opposition to the regime among local entrepreneurs, thus illustrating the extent to which processes of class formation lie outside the control of even a relatively powerful state apparatus. In the petrochemical industry the existence of a powerful state enterprise within the sector was critical to the state's ability to restructure the industry. What resulted was neither a "reinvention of the bourgeoisie" nor the creation of a "state capitalist" sector but, rather, an interesting oligopolistic community in which state and private local capital are thoroughly integrated and similarly organized. It is suggested that focusing on the concrete forms of such oligopolistic communities represents the most promising strategy for understanding the local side of dependent capitalist development.

Drawing on published work and unpublished correspondence, it shows the extent and nature of the influence exerted by Weber on Michels's inquiry into the sociology of parties and organization. Beginning as a syndicalist and renegade Marxist, Michels sharpened his critical perspective under Weber's guidance. The "structural" and sociological analysis in his major work, Political Parties, developed within the categories and norms of Weberian social science. However, substantive disagreement arose over the central "problematic" of modern social theory: for Michels it was "democracy," for Weber "domination." This disagreement accounts for their contrasting interpretations of the organizational phenomenon. The paper concludes with an evaluation of the import of Weber's critique.

Professional reorganization, which often manifests itself in organization formation, should be most likely to occur when interests of corporate clients are strong and professional diversity leads some professional groups to expand their jurisdiction by organizing. We examine these arguments with a study of health maintenance organization (HMO) formation. We find that corporate interests, professional interests, and professional demographics affect professional interests, with the larger effects being attributed to corporate interests and professional demographics.

It describes changes in the distributional structure of income, the extent of income inequality, and the degree of spatial segretation by income. These factors are then related to levels and trends in poverty concentration. Concentrated urban poverty is confined principally to blacks outside the West and to Hispanics in the Northeast. Poverty concentration among these groups does not reflect a tendency for upper-status minority members to live apart from the poor but an interaction between changes in the distributional structure ov income and patterns of racial/ethnic segregation. The occurence of rising poverty under conditions of high racial/ethnic segregation explains the growing spatial isolation of poor blacks and hispanic in U.S. urban society.

Ames	American Journal of Sociology	85	4	1980-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 926-937	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Our recent experimental research called into question the predictive utility of the free-rider hypothesis regarding the provision of public goods by groups. However, several critical questions regarding the generality of the findings may be raised. This paper reports three systematic replications of the previous research which deal with the most pressing of these questions. Study I shows that the presence of a "provision point" in the payoff structure does not substantially affect the results. Study II indicates that a fivefold increase in the amount of money at stake in the relevant decision does affect behavior but not sufficiently to salvage a strong version of the free-rider hypothesis. Study III shows that experienced subjects do not behave very differently from inexperienced ones in this situation.

But contrary to the professed goals of leading reformers, institutions for delinquent and dependent children expanded rapidly around the turn of the century. Nationwide, private agencies gres faster than those in the public sector. This article attemps to account both for the general rise in juvenile incarceration and for the trend toward privatization. It begins by exploring potential accounts of institutional expansion based on socioeconomic resource flows and social movement influence. The main concern however, is to develop a political model that focuses, first, on the internecine politics of the national charity organization movement and, second, on variation in patterns of state building among the American states. Dynamic quantitative methods are used to test these approaches. Results suggest strongly that the relative growth of public and private institutions was determined largely by political issues, including previous social policy commitments and patronage.

Emotion, it is argued, can be and ofter is subject to acts of management. The individual often works on inducing or inhibiting feelings so as to render them "appropriate" to a situation. The emotion-management perspective draws on an interactive account of emotion. It differs from the dramaturgical perspective on the one hand and the psychoanalytic perspective on the other. It allows us to inspect at closer range than either of those perspectives the relation among emotive experience, emotion management, feeling rules, and ideology. Feeling rules are seen as the side of ideology that deals with emotion and feeling. Emotion management is the type of work it takes to cope with feeling rules. Meaning-making jobs, more common in the middle class, put more premium on the individual's capacity to do emotion work. A reexamination of class differences in child rearing suggest that middle-class families prepare their children for emotion management more and working-class families prepare them less. In this way each prepares its children to psychologically reproduce the class structure.

A number of characteristics of heresy are outlined: it is both near and remote at the same time, and the heretic is a deviant insider. Heresy has social origins but in turn influences social arrangements. The heresy hunt, in which heresy is labeled and heretics are suppressed, serves as an anxiety-relieving ritual for institutional elites and facilitates their dominance within the institution. A case study of heresy, the "modernist controversy" in Roman Catholicism, is examined as one of the most important events in early modern culture and an important aspect of the conflict between science and religion.

However, recent events in American Chinatowns show that the cultural interpretation was overdrawn. The dependence of Chinatowns upon the tourist in dustry has constrained residents to suppress visible manifestations of social unrest and pathology in order to attract customers. The inability of the tourist industry to keep pace with recent immigrations is now bringing these previously suppressed manifestations to the surface. The Chinatown case suggests that the industrial division of labor will prove a fruitful place to seek a synthesis of cultural and institutional theories.

We differ in our approaches to historical materials, in the way we relate argument or theory to data, and in our concern with how theoretical models may be relevant to policy. Furthermore, these differences in approach to understanding the careers of challenging groups lead us to different conclusions on what it takes to gain entry into the American Polity. As I shall try to show, Goldstone's criticism is weak, even when taken in its own terms, but our differences must be understood in the context of these wider issues.

Kelly	American Journal of Sociology	86	6	1981-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1348-1386	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper addresses systematically the possible nexus between insurgent political action and the state apparatus, concentrating specifically on the relationship between urban riots and welfare or reliefgiving activity in the postwar United States. The theoretical warrant for the analysis has its genesis in Piven and Cloward's influential thesis relating insurgency and relief giving in capitalist society. This perspective is juxtaposed with the orthodox developmental perspective of welfare institutions, and the causal processes and underlying images of the state are compared. A critical review of the empirical work on the riot-welfare relationship suggests several deficiencies and questions which we attempt to redress and address, respectively, in a cross-level empirical analysis of (a) changes in welfare expenditures from 1960 to 1970 in a panel of U.S. cities and (b) annual changes in national aggretate relief-program categories for the postwar United States (1947-76). The results of the city-level analysis, parallel to several similar studies, provide extremely weak to no support for the hypothesized riot-welfare relationship. However, the postwar timeseries analysis provides consistently strong evidence that the urban riots played an important role nationally in the short-term expansion of the extent of relief giving across several major program categories. The conclusion considers the implications of the findings for theories of (a) welfare institutions in late capitalism, (b) the state in late capitalism, and (c) collective action and insurgency.

These include theoretical frameworks that emphasize female labor supply, the conditions of labor demand, patriarchal values, the international division of labor, and the effects of exported industrialization. This article examines two societies (South Korea and Taiwan) that showed considerable similarity in female labor supply conditions, female labor force participation, and cultural values 20 years ago but have since diverged in dramatic and puzziling ways. Using aggregate and microlevel data, this article shows that the emergent differences in married women's employment are best explained by the intersection of labor supply (similar in the two cases) and demand (markedly different). The article highlights the impact of government policy and foreign loan investment in shaping the nature of labor demand during rapid export-led industrialization in both countries.

The approach is distinguished by its focus on specific graduate programs, in particular MBA programs, and by a concentration on different types of attitudes that appear relevant to graduate school matriculation. The article examines the impacts of job values and direct attention to conative attitudes toward graduate school, which are inferred from prior behavior. Results are consistent with earlier findings of SES effects on total years of schooling, yet also explain the absence of parental SES effects on schooling beyond college.

This form of project-based organization in seen as a response to uncertainty and risk in the film industry. The Paper examines the ways in which independent contractors-producers, directors, cinematographers, and actors-organize and operate to reduce uncertainty and risk and to increase profits. The analysis of data from 2,430 films made in the period 1965-80 establishes patterns of recurrent ties among participants who are at comparable levels of cumulative productivity with respect to earnings, Oscars, Oscar nominations, and number of  previous films. The paper also considers the degree to which film earnings are influenced by the past productivity of the major participants.

Using data from a sample survey of U.S. males employed in civilian occupations, it concludes that, in this large-scale, capitalist system, control over the product of one's labor (ownership and hierarchical position) has only indirect effect on alienation, whereas control over work process (closeness of supervision, routinization, and substantive complexity) has an appreciable direct effect on powerlessness, self-strangement, and normlessness.

Philip Morgan	American Journal of Sociology	97	3	1991-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 779-807	The University of Chicago Press	fla		In some northeastern states, levels of childlessness approached 30% for women born in the mid-19th century. Other states in the South and West had levels of 6%-8%. Nationally, childlessness increased across cohorts born in the latter part of the 19th century. Nonmarriage and delayed marriage account for some of this variability. But the argument here is that fertility control within marriage played a major role in producing these differentials. Both the intercohort and cross-sectional differentials in childlessness match differentials in higher parity births, suggesting that fertility control was practiced most in the times and places where childlessness was gratest. Furthermore, "own-children" methods are used to present evidence of fertility control among childless women early in marriage. The argument is not that young women born in the mid-19th century intended to be childless at young ages; it is instead that they were willing and able to postpone childbearing. With fertility delay came experience and circumstances that made it less likely that women would ever marry and/or have children. These arguments are basically the same as those used to account for contemporary childlessness in the United States.

The model develop suggests some necessary revisions to the basic "Wisconsin model" of status attainment in order to indicate the important roles played by both self-concept of ability and parental aspirations as intervening social psychological variables in this process.

But the analytic tools developed in this literature have not been employed to examine the most impressive episode of state building in the postwar United States-the rise of the Pentagon. This article examines the bureaucratic resources at the disposal of the Pentagon and concludes that high-ranking military officers have operated as "relatively autonomous bureaucrats." Case studies of the aeronautics and microelectronics industries provide evidence that the Pentagon has implemented a de facto industrial policy in the name of national defense. The substantive conclusion-that the autarkic Pentagon has implemented a massive industrial policy-contradicts the view that the hegemonic U.S. state is strong in the international arena but too weak and fragmented to plan the domestic political economy.

Feld	American Journal of Sociology	96	6	1991-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1464-1477	The University of Chicago Press	fla		It is reasonable to suppose that individuals use the number of firends that their friends have as one basis for determining whether they, themselves, have an adequate number of friends. This article shows that, if individuals compare themselves with their friends, it is likely that most of them will feel relatively inadequate. Data on friendship drawn from James Coleman's (1961) classic study The Adolescent Society are used to illustratite the phenomenon that most people have fewer friends have. The logic underlying the phenomenon is mathematically explored, showing that the mean number of friends of friends is always greater than the mean number of friends of individuals. Further analysis shows that the proportion of individuals who have fewer friends than the mean number of friends their own friends have is affected by the exact arrangement fo friendships in a social network. This disproportionate experiencing of friends with many friends is related to a set of abstractly similar "class size paradoxes" that includes such diverse phenomena as the tendencies for college students to experience the mean class size as larger than it actually is and for people to experience beaches and parks as more crowded than they usually are.

Cohen, Richard Machalek	American Journal of Sociology	94	3	1988-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 465-501	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Ever since Durkheim, many social scientists have subscribed to the premise that deviance and crime anre "normal" properties of naturally functioning social systems. When trying to explain the causes of these behaviors, however, many social scientists typically resort to the idea of "pathological" origins. On the whole, social scientists have yet to explain how and why "normal" individuals operating in unexceptional social environments deviate and commit crimes, Recent developments in behavioral ecology and evolutionary biology provide new insights that promise to explain how deviance and crime arise naturally in populations of interacting individuals without necessarily implying genetic influences. We interpret criminal behaviors by which offenders expropriate goods or services from others as expressions of diverse behavioral strategies that derive from normal patterns of population-level social organization and interaction. This views accommodates both explanations that focus on individual causes of crime and those directed toward social factors. Our approach permits the generation of novel hypotheses and fully accommodates, simplifies, and helps unify important and diverse insights and findings amassed by a wide range of disciplines and theories that have tried to account for the nature and distribution of crime.

Randall Collins	American Journal of Sociology	91	6	1986-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1336-1355	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Recent feelings of malaise about the condition of sociology confuse the institutional level of the profession's material support with sociology's intellectual content. The "crisis" has been largely the result of a very rapid increase in the number of sociologists in the late 1960s and the 1970s, which has not only caused career problems but has brought increased specialization and mutual metatheoretical recriminations among contending specialties. Both the touting of new quantitative methodologies and the antipositivism of opposing camps tend to operate as ideologies for particular specialties and to obscure the substantive advances that are possible. A number of areas in which creative work is likely to go on in the next 10 years are sketched: historical change; emotion versus cognition; the micro-macro connection; an integrated theory of organizations, networks, and markets; and sex and gender.

Yet, as I approached the problem of producing a commentary useful for social historians, I found myself asking the question: What is left for a sociologist to contribute as a sociologist? The historians represented in this volume (and the one sociologist, Furstenberg, who has temporarily joined them) show an appreciation for social theory, an ability to use sociological methods of both quantitative and qualitative analysis, and add to that their own competence in grounding their work in the particulars of time and place. So what is there left to do that is uniquely sociological? The answer lies, I propose, in the task of sytemization-identifying variables and issues that lend themselves to comparative analysis across times and places. Such variables can be used to examine the differing ways families interact with their social and economic context as well as to consider historical variations in processes within families.

Guest	American Journal of Sociology	89	5	1984-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1161-1188	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Although the decline-of-community thesis has received considerable attention from urban sociologists, most of the empirical evidence brought to bear on the thesis has been cross-sectional rather than longitudinal. In the present study this deficiency is overcome. The characteristics of neighborhood organizations in Seattle, Washington, in 1929 and in 1979 are compared, focusing on the neighborhood level and taking an institutional approach. Two sets of hypotheses about the organizations-the first dealing with changes in resident participation and the second with changes in functional orientation-are derived from the natural-and limited-community models. In general, the analysis provides mixed support for the hypotheses. The data indicate a clear trend toward a more exclusively political emphasis among Seattle neighborhoods but cast doubt on the simple "gemeinschaft" characterization of these areas at an earlier point in time. A major conclusion of the study is that, if the decline-of-community thesis is to give an accurate description of the transformation in urban neighborhood life during the past half-century, the natural-community model should be revised.

Greater tolerance among urban residents, those from nationally diverse republics, and those with nationally mixed parentage and less tolerance among religious people strongly support the modernization theory of ethnic relations. The association of unemployment with intolerance and outbreaks of violence in areas with greater national diversity support theories of ethnic competition. Factors associated with modernism produce greater tolerance but increase the possibility of ethnic conflict. Humanity's dilemma is how to preserve the benefits of modernism for increased intergroup contact and tolerance while avoiding is potentially tragic implications.

Enrollments were high much earlier than these explanations suggest and were probably higher in rural than in urban settings. We argue that the spread of public education, especially in the North and West, took place through a series of nation-building social movements having partly religious and partly political forms. We see these movements as reflecting the involvement and success of American society in the world exchange economy and the dominance of parallel religious ideologies. State-level data are used to show both the absence of positive effects of urban industrialism on enrollments and some suggestive effects of evangelical Protestantism and 19th-century Republicanism.

However, this conclusion assumes that institutional differences operate chiefly at the level of individual industries. This article argues in contrast that important institutional effects are countrywide and demonstrates the effect of country-level institutional differences by comparing recent earnings dynamics in the United States and Germany. The recent trend in real earnings has been steeper in Germany, while the variance in earning mobility has been greater in the United State. This is partly due to higher rates of U.S. job mobility, but cross-national differences in earnings trajectories are evident even for workers who did not change jobs.

The hypothesis that stylistic changes are subject to common behavioral influences is reinforced now that the two sets of data are available for comparison.

More recent research indicates that Israeli teachers tend to generalize the characteristics of ethnic origin so that Orientals are considered less capable intellectually and motivationally to such an extent that their handicaps are irreversible. Using the framework of expectation-states theory, this study proposes that these prevailing tendencies are an inevitable consequence of the functioning of ethnicity as a diffuse status. This interpretation suggest that ethnic prejudice in Israel is a relatively general phenomenon, not limited to the schooling process. The proposition is examined in the context of achievement in professional soccer, where intellectual prerequisites are less demanding. The findings support the proposition, showing similar patterns of ethnic inequality in terms of both actual achievement and the operation of status generalization. The Israeli case suggests that an egalitarian ideology and policies of ethnic integration cannot effectively prevent emerging inequalities so long as ethnicity functions as a diffuse status.

This thesis challenges those theories which claim that the importance of class conflicts declined under state socialism and that therefore such societies should be described as containing nonantagonistic classes or strata. It also challenges the critical theories which acknowledge the existence of a new dominant class in Eastern Europe, but which describe that class as the bureaucracy or technobureaucracy. This paper attempts to base its class analysis on the exploration of the mechanisms and institutions of expropriation of surplus under state socialism. It is suggested that in contemporary Eastern Europe private ownership and market mechanisms of expropriation have been replaced by central planning and redistribution of the economic surplus. All those who have vested interests in the maximization of redistributive power are members of a new dominating class. If we define the new class this way it will include more than just the bureaucracy; potentially, it includes the whole intelligentsia. The paper describes the new dominant class of intelligentsia as a class in statu nascendi. The formation of this class takes a whole historical epoch. In the first stage of state-socialist development the Djilas thesis is basically accurate: under Stalinism and in the early post-Stalinist years the bureaucracy had the monopoly of power. During the last two decades, on the other hand, the social base of power holders has broadened, especially in those countries which experimented with economic and political reforms. The formation of a new dominant class which incorporates the whole of the intelligentsia is now under way.

This study uses longitudinal data taken from the Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics to address the questions whether and why offspring in female-headed households are more likely to experience persistent poverty in adulthood. Four hypotheses regarding the effect of a father's absence are tested: the "no-effects" hypothesis, the "economic-deprivation" hypothesis, the "father-absence" hypothesis, and the "family-stress" hypothesis. Separate analyses are presented for black and whites. The findings indicate that growing up in a female-headed family increases the risk of poverty, but not because of father absence per se. Among whites, economic deprivation and the stress associated with recent family disruption account for nearly all the negative effects of family structure on offsprings' attainment, whereas among black the results are more mixed.

Money's own value is socially constructed since people attribute worth to a medium whose physical characteristics are essentially irrelevant to its monetary role. Money works best when it can be taken for granted and its social construction is hidden. During the greenback era, two monetary alternatives (gold-based money and paper money) were debated, which raised many questions about the nature of monetary value. Using a "macrocultural" approach, we analyze the rethoric of greenbacker and bullionist writings to study the social construction and deconstruction of a taken-for-granted institution.

It also argues that studies must report and control for the prevalence of migration within communities. Data from 19 Mexican communities show that predicable demographic, social, and economic changes accompany increases in migratory prevalence. Although international migration begins within a narrow range of each community's socioeconomic structure, over time it broadens to incorporate other social groups.

Those few sociologists making use of his work rely on his theories of dramatism and symbolism. This paper presents an alternative, complementary analysis of Burke. First, it shows he does not distinguish knowledge and meaning as some who use his work do. Next, it shows that although Burke emphasizes interpretations as a cause of action, he sees, interpretative frames as social, external, and constraining, derived from the dominant mode of production. They help legitimate and reproduce the social order. However, because of man's material aspect, reproduction is imperfect.

Quetelet's labors have previously tended to be misrepresented either as a political project that was an unmediated expression of state and class interests or as a discourse that anticipated the subsequent maturation of Lombrosianism and the Chicago school of ecology. It is suggested here, instead, that Quetelet's social mechanics of crime should properly be understood in terms of its emergence from some of the focal concerns of the domains of penality and the statistical movement which, during the Restoration, coincided in the issue of the regulation of the "dangerous classes." This coincidence informed Quetelet's ideas about the constancy of crime, criminal propensities, the causes of crime, the average man, and social regulation. This article tentatively concludes that Quetelet's multifaceted analysis of crime ultimately fostered a rigid binary opposition between normality and deviation and provided the epistemological core for the dominance of biologism, mental hereditarianism, and economism in positivist criminology.

Featherman	American Journal of Sociology	83	1	1977-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 100-126	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Recent change in the life-cycle processes of educational, occupational and earnings attainments is analyzed among black men native to the South, those native to the North, and black male migrants from the South to the North. Native northerners begin from relatively superior social origins and are better able to capitalize on these in the attainments of education and occupation than are either southern-born group. Between 1962 and 1973 the stratification experiences of the northern-born blacks rapidly converged with those of the white majority, so that by 1973 their system of stratificaion was more like that of whites than that of southern-born blacks. The processes of status allocation among the southern-born in 1973 were like those of northern natives in 1962. In this sense the integration of blacks into the majority stratification system began first and has proceeded furthest among blacks born in the North. Men living in the North, regardless of nativity, enjoy higher earnings than men living in the South. Migrants to the North earned about $400 more in 1972 than did comparable northern natives. This advantage is not accounted for by longer schooling or higher returns to education, occupation, or number of weeks worked, since the natives are equal or superior to the migrants in these factors. In all, changes over the recent decade have supported the internal differentiation of the black population, the development of more distinct socioeconomic strata, the greater stability of inequalities between generations of black men, and gains toward socioeconomic integration. These changes have been more characteristic of the North than of the South.

The stages and types of graffiti careers are traced through interviews with 25 graffiti writers and their gallery and gang patrons. The ethnographic analysis serves to build a framework for joining the usually separate sociological literatures on subcultures, deviant careers, and art worlds. Geographical and social proximity to other writers is the principal determinant of entry into graffiti writing and of whether that activity develops into a career. From their social relations with other writers, graffiti writers gain a sense of audience and a belief that graffiti will give them fame. Recently, police repression and the recruitment of a few writers to paint graffiti canvases for sale in galleries have fragmented the graffiti art world. The conclusion suggests that modifications in labeling and subculture theories are needed to explain the causal connections between social relations and ideological meaning.

Previous findings, from a more limited sample, of the stability of work values, their effects of occupation are all reconfirmed. Educational attainment is affected by initial work values; it also has socializing effects on work values and affects occupational selection. Inclusion of data on gender, family socioeconomic status, and race adds considerably to the explanation, because these attributes affect initial values, educational attainment, and occupational selection.

The notions of group which underpin current models of kinship, marriage, and the family render groups "ontologically variable" because they are ultimately reducible to considerations of interpersonal behavior and normative representations. This I contend, makes them unfit for rigorous comparative study of social organization (the very project of social anthropology). To achieve greater rigor, I suggest a new, "operational" notion of group disentangled from considerations of interpersonal behavior and normative representations, and I consequently derive new and, I hope, more "universal" definitions of kinship, marriage, and the family on the basis of this new notion of group.

In 1913, defending the "principal ideas" of that work, Durkheim supported his conception of the "duality of human nature" (simultaneously social and individual) by emphasizing the "dynamogenic quality of religion," its ability to inspire human aciton a well as to curb it. These arguments do not represent a straighforward development of Durkheim's earlier work but must be undestood within the borader intellectual context within which he worked. Of particular importance were the growing differences among British social anthropologists, notably William Robertson Smith and James Frazer, concerning the mythic or utilitarian nature of primitive religion. On the evidence of this context, it is argued that one of the most critical shifts in the development of Durkheim's sociology of religion took place only after 1900. The process by which Durkheim developed his arguments in support of the former position may be understood in the light of recent work associated with the "strong programme" in the sociology of science. Major contemporary works used by Durkheim can be viewed as exemplars and the basis for analogies between substantively different areas of work rather than as the product of the application of a generalizable sociological method.

Axel van den Berg	American Journal of Sociology	86	3	1980-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 449-478	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The first critical theorists were unable to give their notion of "substantive reason," as opposed to merely instrumental rationality, any real meaning. They ran aground on the old dilemma inherent in attempting to combine the ideals of freedom and reason, what might be called the "dilemma of democratic radicalism." A second generation, led by Habermas, claims to have resolved the dilemma with (1) a "systems analysis" demonstrating the persistent "irrationality" of capitalism, and (2) a "consensus theory of truth" capable of establishing "rational" norms. These attempts, it is argued here, do nothing to resolve the dilemma: the first lacks any empirically verifiable implications; the second is merely a restatement of the dilemma. Some of the possible reasons that critical theory has nevertheless commanded increasing attention among North American sociologists are suggested.

Kick	American Journal of Sociology	84	5	1979-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1096-1126	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper addresses world-system/dependency theories of differential economic growth among nations. We grant that such perspectives have considerable analytic potential but have serious reservations concerning their current empirical status. Our croticisms focus particularly on the absence of evidence on the theoretically specified structural positions (core, semiperiphery, periphery) in the world system and the dynamic relations among them. After indicating why extant quantitative studies that claim to represent "position" are inadecuate, we propose that blockmodel analyses of social structure through multiple networks address world-system formulations far more appropriately. We present a blockmodel of the world system circa 1965 that is based on four types of international networks: trade flows, military interventions, diplomatic relations, and conjoint treaty memberships. While we invite replications with additional network data, this blockmodel provides strong evidence for a core-semiperiphery-periphery structure. We then report regression analyses of the efects of these structural positions on nations' economic growth (change in GNP per capita) from 1955 to 1970. Net of other plausible determinants, these effects are large in magnitude and entirely consistent with world-system/dependency theories theories. Further analyses reinforce the interpretation of these findings as the structural, accumulative advantage of location in the core over that in the periphery. Substantively, our results that exogenetic theories of economic growth are even more powerful than previous analyses have indicated. Moreover, they demonstrate the natural wedding of a conceptual framework (the world system) with an empirically grounded theory of social structure (blockmodel analysis), which has applicability much beyond issues of economic growth.

White	American Journal of Sociology	87	3	1981-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 517-547	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Production markets have two sides: producers are a fully connected clique transacting with buyers as a separate but aggregated clique. Each producer is a distinctive firm with a distinctive product. Each side continually minotors reactions of the other through the medium of a joint social construction, the schedule of terms of trade. Each producer is guided in choice of volume by the tangible outcomes of other producers-not by speculation on hypothetical reactions of buyers to its actions. Each producer acts purely on self-interest based on observed actions of all others, summarized through a feedback process. The summary is the terms-of-trade schedule, which reduces to constant price only in limiting cases. The market emerges as a structure of roles with a differentiated niche for each firm. Explicit formulae-both for firms and for market aggregates-are obtained by comparative-statics methods for one family of assumptions about cost structures and about buyers' evaluations of differentiated products. Not just any set of firms can sustain terms of trade with any set of buyers. There prove to be there main kinds of markets, and three sorts of market failure, within a parameter space that is specified in detail. One sort of market (PARADOX) has a Madison Avenue flavor, another is more conventional (GRIND), and a third (CROWDED) is a new form not included in any existing theory of markets. Current American industrial markets are drawn on for 20 illustrations, of which three are presented in some detail. Inequality in firms' market shares (measured by Gini coefficients) is discussed.

Burt	American Journal of Sociology	94	2	1988-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 356-395	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Much of the evidence of coordination between corporations and their markets comes from cross-sectional conducted within portions of the American economy during the past two decades. We know, especially for manufacturing during the late 1960s, that certain structural qualities of markets predict profits and the organization of large firms. But this evidence is open to an uncomfortable empirical question: To what extent did the social-structural qualities determining resource dependence in American markets change during the 1960s and 1970s so as to limit the generalizability of cross-sectional evidence? The analysis here shows that markets were dramatically stable in he social structure of production relations known to predict the structure of large firms. Relying principally on Department of Commerce data, the article traces the American economy through the 1960s and 1970s in terms of 77 broadly defined markets, describing the stability of market boundaries and patterns of transactions with suppliers and consumers, the enduring profit inequalities generated by the social structure of the markets, and the constant sources of market constraint to be managed by firms designed to operate within each market.

Grusky	American Journal of Sociology	100	4	1995-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 931-971	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article introduces a structural approach to analyzing sex segregation data that rests on margin-free measures of the underlying association in sex-by-occupation arrays. The starting point for the analyses is a log-multiplicative model that is formally consistent with the conventional practice of summarizing cross-national variability in a single parameter pertaining to the overall strength of sex segregation. Under this baseline specification, the segregation regime is forced to take on the same basic shape in each country, with the only form of permissible variability being a uniform compression or expansion of the peaks and valleys characterizing the shared segregation profile. Although the latter model does not account for the cross-national variability in our illustrative data, it can be readily generalized in ways that both improve the fit and yield new insights into the structure and sources of sex segregation. These elaborated models can be used to examine the hierarchical structure of segregation, to identify the dominant "segregation profiles" in industrial countries, and to parse out the net residue of segregation at multiple levels of analysis.

Clayman	American Journal of Sociology	95	3	1989-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 659-691	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Social occasions can be distinguished by the degree to which their temporal length is locally variable or predetermined. Using the live television news interview as an extreme example of the latter, this paper describes how an interactional encounter is brought to a close at a prespecified time. The larger aim is to explore linkages between the organization of interaction and institutional forms generally regarded as social structural in character. The closing process is first examined in casual conversation, which has a variable duration. News interview closings are then examined and are shown to adhere to a systematically modified format that provides for closing at a prearranged time. It is suggested in conclusion that sociotemporal and institutional structures are reproduced through the situated adaptation of generic interactional mechanisms, and that this formulation preserves the integrity of both interaction and social structure while providing for their interconnection.

When account is taken of these points, some cases of alleged multiple discovery turn out to be singletons. This contention is illustrated by means of an examination of the alleged multiple discovery of the theory presented by J. M. Keynes in his General Theory of Employment Interest and Money. The analysis indicates that the familiar claims of the Stockholm school and of Michal Kalecki in this regard should be rejected. The paper ends with a discussion of the importance from the viewpoint of the sociology of science that a discovery be part of a scientist's central message.

Marsden	American Journal of Sociology	88	4	1983-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 686-717	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper modifies the model of purposive action proposed by Coleman to encompass circumstances in which actors have imperfect access to one another. An access network indicating the available channels for exchange is introduced; it creates discrepancies in the number of alternative exchange relationships available to different actors. The connection of two ideas-Emerson's notion that dependency of one actor on another is inversely related to the first actor's number of alternative exchange relationships and Coleman's conception of dependency in terms of the control of one actor's interests by another-permits the introduction of what is termed "price-making behavior." This allows actors favorably situated in the access network to inflate the exchange value of their resources in transactions wi peripheral actors. Effects of the modifications are investigated by means of artificial data; the effects include shifts in the equilibrium distribution of power among actors, in the levels of resource transfer among actors in a given time period, in the outcomes of events, and in the interest satisfaction of actors.

Mittman, Andrew E. Newman	American Journal of Sociology	96	6	1991-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1362-1401	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper links organizational change to social inequality by examining how organizational dynamics affected rates of gender integration among California states agencies between 1979 and 1985. The analysis draws on theories of organizations and organization environment relations to identify factors that influence economic, political, and social pressures for change, the costs of change, and capacities to change in a specific work setting. In conformity with those theories, it is shown that progress toward gender integration has been substantially influenced by the degree of external pressure and bulnerability, the relative sizes of various internal interest groups (e.g., women, nonwhites, unions) that favor or oppose integration, the extent of structural inertia to which an organization is prone by virtue of its size and age, and by characteristics of agency leadership. Some implications of these results for studies of organizations and of social inequality are discussed.

The issues raised by Rachfahl constitute the basis of many later well-known critiques of The Protestant Ethic. Thus this essay offers an outline of how Weber would have replied to his later critics; in addition, it is a significant reiteration and clarification of the arguments found in The Protestand Ethic. The introduction summarizes Rachfahl's objections and points to the reasons why his critique and later ones misconstrue the nature of Weber's arguments.

In the first section we review the treatment of careers in the occupational sociology literature and consider limitations of the traditional conceptualization. In the second section the main features of career lines, their structures and reward trajectories, are described. In conjunction with this discussion, the virtues and drawbacks of several strategies for delineating career lines from empirical data are addressed. In the nex section we sketch the determinants of career-line structures as they reside in industry organization and labor maket compostion. In the concluding pages we consider the implications of a labor market ovelaid with career lines for investigations of the socioeconomic-achievement process.

Hogan, Michele Pazul	American Journal of Sociology	87	4	1982-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 905-920	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper tests the hypothesis that lower occupational and earnings returns to each year of education among southern-born black men residing in the North charaterize only those men who were educated in the South and migrated to the North during their later teens or as adults. Data from the 1973 Wisconsin Occupational Changes in a Generation Survey provide background and job information for three groups of black men: (1) northern-born men growing up in the North; (2) southern-born men who migrated to the North as children and were educated in the North; and (3) southern-born men who were educated in the South and migrated to the North during their later teens or as adults. Earnings and occupational-status structural equation models are estimated for each group of black men. The analyses reveal that the earnings and status-attainment processesare more meritocratic among men who grew up and were educated in the North. Restricting attention to young black men, there are no differences among the groups in occupational returns to education, but substantial differences in earnings returns to education are observed.

Montgomery	American Journal of Sociology	99	5	1994-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1212-1236	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article adds a simple social structure and pattern of social interaction to a Markov model of employment transitions. In the model, society is composed fo many small (two-person) groups. Unemployed individuals find jobs through strong ties (intragroup social interaction), weak ties (random intergroup interaction), and formal channels. Holding constant the total level of social interaction affects the steady-state equilibrium. An increase in weak-tie interactions reduces inequality, thereby creating a more equitable distribution of employment across groups. Moreover, an increase in weak-tie interactions increases the steady-state employment rate if inbreeding by employment status among weak ties is sufficiently low.

Blair	American Journal of Sociology	85	1	1979-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 95-108	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The end of military conscription in the Unites States and the advent of the all-volunteer armed force have placed the American military in the position of competing against civilian sector employers, in the labor market, for quality personnel. Contemporary concerns within the civilian sector regarding quality of work life have made it necessary for the military services to become increasingly concerned with the work-related attitudes of their personnel. Our analysis compared the attitudes of a sample of soldiers in the all-volunteer army in 1973 with those of soldiers in the conscription-based army of World War II. We found that representative samples of enlisted men in 1943 were more positively oriented toward their jobs than are the soldiers of the 1970s. Some similarities were observed between World War II AWOLs and soldiers in the all-volunteer force. The relatively negative attitudes of contemporary soldiers may reflect, at least in part, a postwar demoralization that was observed after the end of hostilities in World War II as well.

Weakliem	American Journal of Sociology	95	3	1989-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 549-591	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article asks whether the exercise of choice and discretion over task-related aspects of a job strenghtens or weakens the bond that ties workers to their employers. Past work on the relationship between worker control and attachment has been theoretically vague, and the empirical evidence generally consists only of positive association between indicators of control and attachment. The research reported here changes this situation in two ways. First, is systematizes prevailing commentary through the formulation of a series of hypotheses that specify the intervening mechanisms through which control shapes attachment. Second, it incorporates these hypotheses into a model of the causal relations generating the association between control and attachment. The results of a covariance structure analysis largely confirm the hypotheses derived from past work even as they show that the total effect of control on attachment is virtually zero because positive indirect effects offset a negative direct effect. The findings suggest a rethinking of prevailing conceptualizations of the significance workers assign to control of their own immediate work processes.

This same organization provides interactants the resources for recognizing breakdowns of intersubjectivity and for repairing them. This article sets the concern with intersubjectivity in theoretical context, sketches the organization by which it is grounded and defended in ordinary interaction, describes the practices by which trouble in understanding is dealt with, and illustrates what happens when this organization fails to function. Some consequences for contemporary theory and inquiry are suggested.

Klein	American Journal of Sociology	83	1	1977-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 78-99	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper offers a theory and an explicit mathematical model of a peasant revolution's effects on inequality and status inheritance. We predict that, when an exploited peasantry revolts and overthrows the traditional elite, (1) in the short run, peasants are better off, and both inequality and status inheritance decline. But human capital becomes more valuable, and revolution does not benefit the poorest of its supporters as much as those who were better off before. (2) In the long run, peasants still benefit. But revolution proves new opportunities for those with education, ability, luck, or other resources; therefore economic inequality, educational inequality, and status inheritance grow steadily among the peasantry. In many circumstances, inequality and status inheritance will also grow in the society as a whole and may eventually exceed their prerevolutionary levels. The theory applies not only to revolutions but also to the long-run effects of any economic or social change that reduces exploitation or increases economic opportunities.

Structuralist semiotics (with special reference to Saussure) is used a resource for examining the deficiencies of both formalist and interpretativist positions on these relationship. Structural explanation is described as an alternative. Umberto Eco's idea of a semantic encyclopedia is used as the basis of an illustration which is set forth in contrast to a formalist (Blau) and an interpretativist (Bittner/Garfinkel) theory of social structures. The argument rests upon the assumption that, because measurement is the encodement of what sociologists call observations, structuralist semiotics can be employed to provide an explanation for the language of measurement that depends on a semantics of social structures as such.

A survey of textile workers in Barcelona indicates that the growing proportion of more affluent workers in Spain in a source of greater class consciousness in the sense of class militancy and politicization. These dimensions of consciousness, however, are inversely associated with working-class identification among higher-income workers. The findings are interpreted within a comparative theoretical framework which emphasizes the relevance of both the pattern of economic growth and the political structure as structural variables conditioning the relationship between affluence and class consciousness.

Faia	American Journal of Sociology	86	5	1981-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1093-1111	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Recent studies of status attainment have relied heavily in the general linear model. In the relationship between status and education, important departures from linearity may occur as a result of certification screening (of preference) by employers; yet many researchers have virtually ignored this process and the possibility that it may serve several functions. Data from the 1977 NORC General Social Survey show that academic certification has a substantial impact on occupational prestige and (more ambiguously) on respondent's income, independently of years of school completed and other predictors; this impact appears to vary according to age of respondent. In conclusion, the status-attainment proces in the United States may depart substantially from the "rational choice" model favored by human capital theory.

Hauser	American Journal of Sociology	82	3	1976-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 621-651	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The occupational socioeconomic status of men in the experienced civilian labor force (ECLF) rose between 1962 and 1973, and black men gained more than whites. Although the racial gap narrowed over the decade, black men in 1973 had not matched the occupational standing of white men in 1962. Intercohort changes in schooling and, to a lesser degree, changes in family background account for some of the shifts. Changes in the effects of schooling and of social background have occurred, and these differ between the races. Among white men in the ECLF, family factors are less important in occupational allocation than they were a decade ago; schooling has increased in importance relative to family background; both the effect of schooling on occupational standing and educational level of occupational incumbents have increased. In contrast, among black men in the ECLF, family factors were more tightly linked with occupational achievement in 1973 than in 1962, and black men with the same socioeconomic background and schooling held higher-status jobs in 1973 than in 1962. Among young workers, patterns of socioeconomic stratification do not differ by race as much as they did in previous years. Still, socioeconomic discrimination by race is prevalent, especially among workers with established work histories. We suggest that race and class have become less important in the processes which allocate men from families to schooling and subsequently to positions in the occupational hierarchy.

Grusky	American Journal of Sociology	96	1	1990-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 107-143	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Using the 14 annual cross sections from the General Social Survey (GSS), the article describes and explains the year-to-year fluctuations in occupational attainment from 1972 to 1987. Although some commentators have argued that ascriptive processes have reemerged in recent years, only limited evidence of such processes over this period is found. Instead, the year-to-year fluctuations are a more complex function of various macro-level changes, and a multivariate model must be introduced to account for these patterns. The results indicate that the gradual growth of bureaucratic personnel policies might have equalized opportunities, but the direct political interventions by federal agencies appear to have more impressive and consistent effects. The article concludes by nothing that "evolutionary theories" of stratification have overlooked the effects of political interventions on occupational attainment.

Tuch	American Journal of Sociology	87	1	1981-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 130-142	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This research note applies latent structure methods to the analysis of a set of survey items designed to measure prejudice toward blacks. Data from 1972 and 1977 national samples are employed to demonstrate the utility of latent structure techniques in analyzing trends over time in prejudiced attitudes. Various latent class models are presented and evaluated, and a four-class quasi-latent structure model is found to best describe the data in both years. This model posits the existence of two classes of "intrinsic ideologues" who exhibit extreme response patterns with certainty in addition to a single latent dichotomous variable that accounts for the association among the indicators. The fit of the model is very good, and changes in prejudice over time are succinctly described with reference to its estimated parameters.

Their central feature is that the wage of an employee is tied directly to her current performance. Focusing on salespersons in department stores, the author considers wage differences under three payment systems: a straight salary, a straight commision, and a salary plus commission. Four conceptions of wage inequalities under the three systems are contrasted: a risk-sharing, a bargaining, a sorting, and a social status interpretation. The empirical analyses compare the pay schemes and wages of approximately 63,000 salespersons in 178 department stores in 1981.

Wilson, Alejandro Portes	American Journal of Sociology	86	2	1980-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 295-319	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Data from a longitudinal sample of Cuban emigres are used to test competing hypotheses about the mode of incorporation of new immigrants into the U.S. labor market. Classic theories of assimilation assumed a unified economy in which immigrants started at the bottom and gradually moved up occupationally, while they gained social acceptance. Recent dual labor market theories define new immigrants mainly as additions to the secondary labor market linked with small peripheral firms. Multivariate analyses confirm the existence of the primary/secondary dichotomy but add to it a third alternative condition. This is the enclave economy associated with immigrant-owned firms. While most immigrant enterprises are samll, competitive ones, enclave workers show distinct characteristics, including a significant return to past human capital investments. Such a return is absent among immigrant workers in the secondary labor market. Causes and implications of these findings are discussed.

This article places these revolutions in a common historical context, arguing that their shared ideology and their method of capturing state power differentiate them from revolutions of later periods. After establishing that these revolutions belonged to the same class of events, this article also explores the differences between the successful Ottoman and Iranian revolutions and the failed Russian revolution. The conclusion is that the Ottoman and Iranian legal assemblies, which were buttressed by extraparaliamentary and extralegal resources, were far more powerful and effective. Furthermore, the intrastate cleavages in the Ottoman Empire and Iran were essential for winning military support in the battle to restore the constitutional regimes in the aftermath of counterrevolutionary backlash.

In accordance with neoclassical predictions from human capital theory, net positive returns to individuals' education and experience and to occupations' cognitive and physical skills are found. While sex differences in experience have large effects on the sex gap skill contributes little to the gap. In accordance with cultural feminist predictions, negative returns to being in an occupation with a higher percentage of females or requiring more nurturant social skill are found. These forms of gendered valuation contribute significantly to the sex gap in pay. In contrast to the neoclassical prediction of compensating differentials, the analysis did not find consistently positive effects for onerous physical conditions, nor did these have much effect on the gap.

These canonical scales yield higher intergenerational correlations than the Duncan SEI primarily because they capitalize on chance fluctuations in the data used to construct them. Thus, there is no reliable basis for revising previous findings about the relative importance of ascription and achievement in the stratification process. Canonical scaling (and related log-linear and log-multiplicative models) are no more than a useful adjunct to models that locate the sources of intergenerational occupational persistence in the measurable characteristics of occupations and persons.

Roos	American Journal of Sociology	89	3	1983-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 612-650	The University of Chicago Press	fla		A substantial difference in average earnings between men and women employed full-time is documented for each of nine industrial nations, and several hypothesized explanations for the earnings gap are explored: a human capital hypothesis-women earn less because they have less education and experience; a dual career hypothesis-women earn less because they adjust their work behavior to meet the demands of family obligations; and an occupational segregation hypothesis-women earn less because they are concentrated in lowlevel jobs. None of these hypotheses receives much support in any country, leaving open the possibility that the earnings differences are due to deeply entrenched institutional arrangements that limit women's opportunities and achievements.

Lincoln, Jon Olson	American Journal of Sociology	87	2	1981-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 308-335	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The organizational principles of rationality and equity account for the bureaucratic leveling effect on social differences posited by Weber. An inference from this framework, that organizational systems will neither create nor reinforce inequality based on gender or race, was examined with data provided by the members of six multiagency social service delivery systems. The dependent variable was a measure of access to the networks of interorganizational exchange that tied together the agencies in these systems. This measure, called centraliy, did not vary by race or gender. However, an analysis of first-and second-order interaction effects indicated that the combinations of investments and contributions that were predictive of centrality were very different for white men, white women, nonwhite men, and nonwhite women. A complicated process of negotiation for resource and advantages was indicated that is not easily reconciled with deductions from classical organizational theory.

Test using cross-national data sets representing Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, and the United States over the period 1964-90 suggest a process of acculturation to the class of destination. The authors hypothesized that a class with a high degree of demographic identity influences newcomers more than a class with low demographic identity does and that, the more left-wing inflow there is into a class, the more likely the immobile members are to have left-wing political preferences. The data did not confirm these hypotheses. A macro analysis does, however, show that the level of class voting is weakened by a compositional mobility effect.

If religious, military, or political leaders decide to strengthen the boundaries of their group, they tend in consequence to impose harsh penalties on forms of sexual behavior that breach social or symbolic boundaries. This may be because they have adopted a code of belief and conduct that emphasizes the need to maintain boundaries of all kinds, including those between humans and animals and between males and females, or because they wish to prohibit the formation of sexual relationships that cut across the internal and external boundaries of their group or organization. The principal groups and institutions examined are the Old Testament Jews, the Parsees, ancient Greek states and their armies, early and medieval Christianity, the German National Socialist movement, and the modern British armed forces.

White	American Journal of Sociology	94		1988-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. S17-S51	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Price and authority have traditionally been regarded as alternative social mechanisms for allocating resources. However, actual transactions-whether inter- or intrafirm-can be evaluated in terms of the extent to which they combine both of these mechanisms. An especially revealing example of this is the exchange of goods between two profit centers in the multi-profit center firm. Three of the most common arrangements, or transfer pricing polices, for effecting these transactions are examined here. Exchange autonomy transfers depend primarily on price, with no or minimal use of authority. Mandated full cost transfers involve a substantial exercise of authority relative to the use of price. Mandated market based transfers use both authority and price in important ways. For all three policies, the transaction costs of these internal transactions may exceed these costs on external transactions.

Specifically, it attempts to discover whether the large and enduring regional variations in fertility and nuptiality which characterized 19th-century France can be accounted for by variations in modes of production. The findings indicate that differences in modes of production were associated with variations in population patterns, though not always in the ways originally predicted. The data show that areas of capitalist production were characterized by markedly higher levels of nonmarital fertility and, under certain conditions, higher total fertility and earlier marriage as well. The implications of these findings for some major theories of demographic change are discussed.

The additional variables can be continuous or categorical. The (partial) bivariate relationship between origin and destination can be modeled with any of the existing multiplicative mobility models. In an empirical example, two main results emerge: interactions off the main diagonal become insignificant with the introduction of education and race variables; main diagonal effects for one origin category become insignificant while those for other categories do not, suggesting that different mechanisms of status transmission are at work in different strata.

The article uses data from a panel study of mothers and children to show that the religiosity of both mothers and children influences the cohabiting and marital behavior of children, with those from less religious families having higher rates of entering intimate coresidential unions and a tendency to substitute cohabitation and marriage. Analyses of the reciprocal influences of cohabitation and marriage on religiosity indicate that cohabitation decreases religiosity, while marriage leads to increased religious participation.

The socially shared presuppositions they brought to their reading caused West Indian reviewers to interpret Lamming's novels as involving questions of personal and national identity, British reviewers to concentrate on the novels' language and literary qualities, and American reviewers to emphasize race. Each of Lamming's novels exercises a different degree of "cultural power," and this capacity to engender multiple meanings while retaining coherence shows that cultural meanings emerge from the interaction between cultural works of varying power and human recipients of varying expectations and concerns. In turn, this interaction suggests a theory of metaphor that enables research in the sociology of culture to utilize both cultural and sociological data without reducing one to the other.

We test these assumptions on a body of 1973 data gathered in Louisville, Kentucky. A second-order interaction of race and sex with all relationships in a model which integrated models proposed by Duncan, Haller, and Portes (1968) and Sewell, Haller, and Ohlendorf (1970) was found, and important similarities between white males and black females were observed. White males and black females showed the strongest reciprocal peer effects on educational plans and the strongest parental-encouragements effects on grades received. There was no feedback from students' expectations to the amount of parental encouragement, although for whites only there was feedback from students' grades. The model best fits the data for white males. This difference in fit, Commonly interpreted as a function of the disadvantaged positions of blacks and females in the stratification system, is futher specified with reference to the particular varibles in the model.

Network analysis techniques are used for the construction of matrices that (1) map the interconnections between organizations, (2) measure the intensity and directionality of those interconnections, (3) illuminate clusters of proximate organizations, and (4) identify groups central to the clusters. The matrices show the primacy of suffrage and women's rights to reform activity during the period under study (1840-1914). Peak analysis finds important clusters of relations organized around the Women's Trade Union League,Garrisonian abolitionism, and Sorosis. Finally, directional analysis shows that women's organizing efforts can be divided into three distinct periods of activity between 1840 and 1914, with significant changes in the relations among organizations from period to period. The conclusion discusses the theoretical implications of these findings.

The fndings suggest that at certain stages of societal development differential expansion in the occupational and educational spheres may reinforce the significance of social origins in the status-attainment process and suppress the influence of education as an intervening mechanism of status transmissiion.

First,studies of students who received only a partial treatment (i.e., began desegregation after they had completed one or more years of segregated schooling) find weaker treatment effects. Second, the type of control group used was correlated with the measured effect of desegregation: studies which used random-assignment experimental designs found significantly stronger treatment effects, while studies which compared black achievement growth either to that of white students or to achievement test norms found much weaker (usually negative) treatment effects. We conclude that desegregation does enhance black achievement by about .3 standard deviations, but this effect seems to occur only in the earliest primary grades.

This article examines the effect of children on marital stability, using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, and tests the propositions that (1)children enhance marital stability, (2) younger children increase stability more than older children, and (3) under some circumstances children have no stabilizing effect or even increase chances that their parents' marriage will end. A proportional hazards model in continuous time is estimated and the modified to accommodate key features of the data. The results indicate that fistborn children increase the stability of marriage through their preschool years. Other children increase marital stability only when they are very young. Older children and children born before marriage significantly increase chances of disruption. The initially stabilizing and later destabilizing effects of children combine over the course of the marriage to give parents only a modestly higher change than childless couples of reaching their twentieth wedding annivesary.

Thoits	American Journal of Sociology	91	2	1985-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 221-249	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Thomas Scheff's labeling approach to mental illness is based on reactions of other to "residual rule-breaking." This article develops a theory of self-labeling processes to account for the unexplained phenomenon of voluntary treatment seeking. By taking the role of the generalized other, individual can assess the meaning of their impulses and actions. When individuals observe themselves frequently or persistently breaking "residual rules," they attribute disturbance to themselves and may seek professional help. Drawing from Hochschild and Pugliesi, the article reconceptualized " residual rule-breaking" as violations of feeling or expression norms. When individuals are unable to manage or transform deviant feelings, self-attributions of disturbance should result. The conditions under which feeling management attempts are likely to fail and result in self-attributions of disturbance are outlined in the context of a more general theory of emotional processes. Some conditions under which labeling by others may occur are also identified, using the same theoretical approach.

Since investigators can analyze cross-classifications with concepts similar to those used in regression and path analysis, they may feel that the level of measurement problem has been solved. This study shows, however, that at least one approach, log-linear analysis, does not by itself solve every measurement problem. Unless the technique is applied carefully, it may produce highly misleading results. The conditions under which log-linear models can be misleading are explored within the context of causal analysis of surveys.

This article discusses sociological prediction, using geopolitical theory's successful prediction of the breakup of the Soviet Union as an example. Other predictions and explanations of the Soviet breakup generally lack theoretical validity. The precision of macropolitical predictions is limited to a range of decades, but state breakdown and revolution occur in a much narrower time period. The transfer of power happens in a mass mobilization lasting a few days, thus creating the illusion that spontaneous popular will causes macropolitical change and masking the structural shifts that make the change possible.

The complex features of occupations are collapsed here into two orthogonal dimensions. The vertical dimension is captured by the concept of status and the horizontal one by the concept of field or situs. Our objective is to study the unique relationship of each dimension with the work values an individual holds. While the effects of class and status on attitudes and beliefs have been demonstrated in a number of studies, the association of occupational situs and work values has not yet been shown. Conceptualizing situses as functional subsystems, we are able to hypothesize specific associations between four kinds of work values and 10 situs clusters. The findings, in a sample of 1,200 female and male workers, affirm the predictions and, moreover, show that the occupational situs is apparently the better predictor of value preferences as compared with occupational status and a number of background variables.

The status of school members within the academic community and changes in the situation of the discipline within the university are seen as affecting not only the formation of the school of though as a social entity but also the specific content of its Cognitive innovations.

Consistent with theoretical predictions, moderate, positive correlations are found between rates of interracial marriage and crime. The article also explores the relationship between the dimensions of social structure identified by Blau-group size, heterogeneity, intergroup inequality ("consolidation"), and segregation-and these two forms of social association. Both interracial marriage and interracial crime are influenced significantly by at least one of these structural conditions. Contrary to initial expectations, however, the effects of social structure vary by the form of association. The rate of interracial marriage is positively affected by the degree of racial income equality, whereas interracial crime rates are more strongly influenced by relative group size and racial residential segregation. The article concludes with a few speculative remarks concerning the differential effects of structural variables on different forms of association.

This empirical account explains the transition in political communication from norms of secrecy to appeals to public opinion. Popular communicative change in the English Revolution anticipated, in practice, the democratic theory of the public sphere when printing transformed a traditional instrument of communication-the petition. Petitions had medieval origins and traditions that upheld norms of secrecy and privilege in political communication. Economic and technical properties of printing-namely, heightened commercialism and the capacity to reproduce texts-demolished these norms by changing the scope and content of communication by petition. This practical innovation appears in all factions in the revolution. But among radical groups, the political use of printed petitions led to novel theories and to democratic speculation on constitutional provisions that would ensure the authority of public opinion in politics. This analysis contradicts key assumptions on communicative change that fuel pessimistic assessments of the modern public sphere in post-modernism and critical theory.

This paper concerns the extent to which economic action is embedded in structures of social relations, in modern industrial society. Although the usual neoclasical accounts provide an "undersocialized" or atomized-actor explanation of such action, reformist economists who attempt to bring social structure back in do so in the "oversocialized" way criticized by Dennis Wrong. Under-and oversocialized accounts are paradoxically similar in their neglect of ongoing structures of social relations, and a sophisticated account of economic action must consider its embeddedness in such structures. The argument in illustrated by a critique of Oliver Williamson's "markets and hierarchies" research program.

Erickson	American Journal of Sociology	82	3	1976-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 605-620	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Given a city that contains only a small proportion of the residents in the larger ecological community, the conventional crime rate for that city could be high merely because the denominator of the rate underestimates the potential number of victims or offenders. Accordingly, there is a basis for anticipating a direct relatinship among cities between (1) community/city population size rations and (2) rates for particular types of crimes. The relationship does hold for many American cities when Urbanized Areas (UAs) or Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSAs) are taken as approximations of communities; but it holds only for singular cities, each of which is the only central city in a SMSA. The argument of this paper is that singular cities are much more homogeneous as regards dominance within the cmmunity than are other types of cities, and that dominance determines the extent to which a city will attract nonresident participants in crimes. In any case, the findings cast doubts on the use of conventional crime rates for cities in testing theories.

The more publicity devoted to the execution, the the more homicides decrease thereafter. This decrease apparently occurs because capital punishment has a short-term deterrent effect on homicides.

Judith Stepan-Norris, Maurice Zeitlin	American Journal of Sociology	96	5	1991-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1151-1200	The University of Chicago Press	fla		What are the effects of the political consciousness of union leaders-and thus of the struggles they lead-in shaping the "political regime of production," that is, the political relations through which the capital/labor relation in the sphere of production is defined, regulated, and enforced? In the prevailing functionalist theory, whether in its "pluralist" or "Marxist" variant, the effects are nil: union leaders cannot transcend the labor union's inherent system stabilizing functions (to routine conflict, contain discontent, and "incorporate" the working class). In this article, an analysis of a sample of contracts won by U.S. industrial unions, 1937-55, shows that union leadership-left, right, and center-has substantial independent effects in determining the production regime. Specifically, the contracts won by communist-led unions were far more likely, throughout the era, to be "pro-labor" (i.e., to undermine the sway of capital within production) than those won by their rivals.

We can test for imputations of essences by noting whether an actor changes his menaing when he defines others by referring only to observable phenomena-their past, manifested activities. The concepts of deviance and charisma, defined as inferior and superior capacity to respond in interaction, summarize the two forms of essences. In these moral transactions, people establish ambivalent identities for themselves, limitating their own actions and risking reversals of identity with those labeled.

Massey	American Journal of Sociology	96	2	1990-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 329-357	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article argues that racial segregation is crucial to explaining the emergence of the urban underclass during the 1970s. A strong interaction between rising rates of poverty and high levels of residential segregation explains where, why and in which groups the underclass arose. This argument is developed with simulations that replicate the economic conditions observed among blacks and whites in metropolitan areas during the 1970s but assume different conditions of racial and class segregation. These data show how a simple increase in the rate of minority poverty leads to a dramatic rise in the concentration of poverty when it occurs within a racially segregated city. Increases in poverty concentration are, in turn, associated with other changes in the socioeconomic character of neighborhoods, transforming them into physically deteriorated areas of high crime, poor schools, and excessive mortality where welfare-dependent, female-headed families are the norm. Thus, policies to solve the socioeconomic problems of minorities will fail unless they are accompanied by measures for overcoming the disadvantages caused by racial discrimination and prejudice in the housing market.

Coleman	American Journal of Sociology	91	6	1986-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1309-1335	The University of Chicago Press	fla		After an extraordinarily promising beginning in 1937 with The Structure of Social Action, Talcott Parsons abandoned his attempt to ground social theory in a theory of purposive action. The functionalism that resulted moved in one direction, while social research has progressively moved in an individual-behavioristic direction, resulting in an ever-widening divergence between research and theory. This paper describes paths in research and in theory development, that will reconstitute relevance of each for the other. The essential elements are two. The first is use of a theory of purposive action as a foundation for social theory; this entails acceptance of a form of methodological individualism and rejection of holism. The second is a focus in social research and theory on the movement from the level of individual actions to macrosocial functioning, that is, the level of system behavior.

Anderton, Rebecca Jean Emigh	American Journal of Sociology	94	4	1989-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 832-855	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Three theoretical explanations for the effects of polygyny on marital fertility are investigated through an analysis of birth intervals in polygynous marriages of a 19th-century Utah population. Through the use of life-course fertility histories, behavior among polygynous wives is shown to depend on the number of children born to all wives rather than on biological factors such as the competition among greater numbers of wives for reproductive attention or age related infecundity. When biological effects are controlled, a greater (lesser) number of children born to earlier wives reduces (increases) fertility of more recent wives later in their life courses. Thus, it is argued that largely data-driven studies of polygyny may benefit from fertility theory, which emphasizes the role of the demand for children.

The present paper argues that the perstige of occupations, as it is ordinarily graded, is a simple average of these two dimensions, implying that prestige has both a factual and a normative component. The argument is theoretical rather than inductive: it begins from the assumption that prestige has both a factual and a normative component. The argument is theoretical rather than inductive: it begins from the assumption that assessments of prestige do in fact involve considerations of economic reward, an it employs the data in conjunction with this well-grounded assumption to infer what other considerations must be involved. The argument is prosecuted by means of polar coordinate analysis. This method is applicable because R2 for the regression of social standing (taken to be a synonym for prestige) on other aspects of occupation is close to one; and virtually all the variance of each vector of occupational assessment lies in a space of three dimensions. The final discussion suggests that, although the data point to the existence of a normative consensus, this consensus bears little relation to prestige in its traditional prestige which bolsters the elite is a fragile thing, whereas the normative consensus on occupational prestige may constitute an important source of legitimation of the distribution of social rewards.

Kandel	American Journal of Sociology	90	6	1985-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1284-1325	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Event history analyses are applied to life and drung histories to specify the casual sequences that underlie the associations between marijuana use and family roles observed in cross-sectional data: inverse relationships with marriage and being a parent; positive relationships with separation/divorce. Role selection and role socialization account for these relationships, and both processes contribute to the resolution of potential incompatibilities between family roles and marijuana use. Role selection effects of marijuana use are reflected in postponement of marriage and parenthood and increased risk of marital dissolution. Socialization effects of family roles on marijuana use are reflected in the reduced risk of marijuana initiation after marriage among women and the increased rate of stopping marijuana use after marriage among women and after parenthood among men. Anticipatory socialization is reflected in an increased propensity to stop marijuana use before marriage among men and women and before parenthood among women.

The model links SES, occupational direction, control, and planning (DCP), personality factors, and depression/distress in a causal sequence. The data to test the social causation model against alternative, social selection models are derived from samples of psychiatric patients and community residents in Washington Heights, New York City. The key factor of DCP is operationalized using ratings from the Dictionary of Occupational Titles. The results support the social causation model and cannot be accounted for by several tests derived from social selection models. Thus the results increase the plausibility of the social causation model and suggest the need for further research on the links between occupational conditions and mental disorder.

It is an attempt to hold resources that can be justified by more than one legitimating principle. Property tansformation in postsocialist Hungary involves the decentralized reorganization of assets and the centralized management of liabilities. Together they blur the boundaries of public and private, the boundaries of enterprises, and the boundedness of justificatory principles. Enterprise-level field research, data on the ownership structure of Hungary's 220 largest enterprises and banks, and an examination of the government's recent debt consolidation programs suggest the emergence of a distinctively East European capitalism that will differ as much from West European capitalism as do contemporary East Asian variants.

Two hypotheses are tested. First, a positive relationship between revolution and intervention can be found overt the longue durée of the two centuries. Second, however, the relationship is conditional on changing structural processes of the world system: the Kondratieff wave and the long wave of world leadership. Both hypotheses receive support from longitudinal data. Revolution is associated with intervention, but more so when the world system undergoes restructuring during Kondratieff expansions and hegemonic decline.

The authors introduce the concept of the technological niche, which includes a focal innovation, the innovations on which the focal innovations builds, the innovations that build upon the focal innovation, and the technological ties among the innovations within the niche. Using patents and patent citations to measure characteristics of innovation niches within the semiconductor industry, the authors show that the size of the niche and the status of the actors within the niche have a positive effect on the likelihood that subsequent innovations will build upon the focal innovation. Competitive intensity within the niche has a negative effect on this likelihood.

Whereas the study of those remembered as great or evil draws on Durkheimian Theory's consensus and cohesion, this does not explain the memory of the "incompetent." Reputational politics is an arena in which forces compete to control memory. Reputations are grounded in a social construction of character, subsequently generalized to policy and the character of the society. In the case of Warren G. Harding, the U.S. president rated lowest by historians and the public, political opponents set the agenda, while potential supporters did not defend him, given their political interests, structural positions, and a lack of credible narrative.

Cornfield	American Journal of Sociology	91	5	1986-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1112-1153	The University of Chicago Press	fla		An organizational explanation of post-World War II declining union membership, termed the "replenishment thesis," is developed to compensate for the deemphasis on decline in Marxian, functional, and economic theories of unionization. Since 1945, large nonunion corporations have stabilized their work forces by providing private employee welfare plans, and unions have consequently been most successful in organizing employees of small establishments. These have often folded, thereby jeopardizing union membership. The thesis is tested with analyses of the membership trends, representation election outcomes, and local union turnover rates of the United Furniture Workers between 1939 and 1982.

To assess the experimental impacts, we use a stochastic model of rare events in which the rate at which an event occurs is assumed to depend log linearly on a set exogenous variables. Overall, income maintenance raises the rate of marital dissolution. For black, white, and Chicana women, the greatest increase occurs at the support levels closest to the control situation. The impact of income maintenance on remarriage differs by race-ethnicity. For Chicanas, the rate of remarriage decreases as the level of support increase. For blacks and whites, income maintenance has no discernible impact on the rate of remarriage. The results provide empirical evidence that a change in economic situation does affect marital events in low-income populations.

This paper examines each of Nisbet's charges and concludes that his oft-praised volume provides a misleading view of the new evolutionism and a less than satisfactory guide to the study of social change. Above all, Nisbet's charge that the new evolutionism is based on metaphor and analogy ignores entirely the increasingly substantial empirical grounding to theory in archaeological, historical, and socilogical research. Also, his effort to force scholars to choose between the nomothetic concerns of evolutionists and the idiographic concerns of historians and some historical sociologist invites conflict where cooperation is needed.

States were quicker to adopt legislation when productivity and work-accident litigation were high and when nonagricultural workers outnumbered agricultural ones. Despite the influence of capital and labor in shaping workmen's compensation in other analyses, the speed of state legislation was unaffected by the presence or interests of capital and labor groups. This suggests that the speed of adoption was shaped by a different aspect of capital-labor relations than is seen when studies focus on the activities of specific actors or groups.

Yet these studies have been plagued by a troubling theoretical and empirical imprecision. This imprecision stems from three sources. First, these studies are generally silent on the basic sociological dynamics that account for the reported findings. Second, movement scholars have generally failed to specify and test the precise dimensions of social ties that seem to account for their effects. Finally, most studies fail to acknowledge that individuals are embedded in many relationships that may expose the individual to conflicting pressures. This article seeks to address these shortcomings by means of an elaborated model of recruitment that is then used as a basis for examining the role of social ties in mediating individual recruitment to the 1964 Mississippi Freedom Summer Project.

Williamson	American Journal of Sociology	93	6	1988-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1424-1456	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper addresses long-standing debates over the role of demographic structure, class power, class-based political parties, and democraphic political participation in the growth of the welfare state in advance industrial democracies from 1950 to 1980. It distinguishes four theories-industrialism, monopoly capitalism, social democratic, and interest-group politics-and tests them using pooled, cross-sectional, time-series data for 18 nations and seven time points. Total social welfare spending, composed primarily of social insurance benefits, is dominated by the size of the aged population, smaller but important effect of nonclass political variables such as voting participation and electoral competition, and interaction of age with political and other variables. Public assistance, means-tested programs, however, are dominated by class variables. Although evaluation of the theories must consider the domain of programs to which each best applies, the results generally favor an interest-group-politics theory, which posits the dominant influence of demographic and political factors.

This article argues that both explanations imply that racial competition generated collective action against busing. It suggests that increases in interracial exposure in schools and neighborhoods trigger racial and ethnic conflict. This article examines these competition arguments using data on antibusing events, school desegration, and interracial residential exposure in SMSAs from 1968 through 1990. The results suggest that the amount of school desegregation significantly raised rates of protests against busing. Furthermore, there is little evidence that the federal origin of court-ordered busing increased antibusing activity.

Their theories, although varying in specific hypotheses, may be partially subsumed under the general proposition that supervision of the parent in salient behavioral domains is positively related to a parental value on conformity and negatively related to a value on self-reliance. Hypotheses derived from this theory are tested on a sample of 122 cultures drawn from the Human Relations Area Files and the Standard Cross-cultural Sample and are generally supported. Implications for further theoretical development are discussed.

Robinson	American Journal of Sociology	99	1	1993-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 49-74	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The hypothesis that economic strategies (wives' employment, children's employment, and taking in boarders) were adopted out of necessity by working-class families and at the point in the family life cycle when need was greatest is tested on a sample of families living in Indianapolis from 1860 to 1880. Loss of husband's income led some wives to seek employment, but generally did not lead families to use other strategies. Middle-class families were as likely as working-class families to use economic strategies. Families did, however, make more use of economic strategies as they moved through the most financially stressful stage of the life cycle-when the largest number of children lived at home. Thus, all three economic strategies showed a rise-and-fall pattern as families moved through the life cycle.

The model has several novel features: it applies a quantitative analysis to the logic of structural-historical studies of revolution that generally proceed in a qualitative fashion; it yields a strong prediction of political crisis in mid-17th-century England and of relative stability in the preceding and succeeding centuries; and it helps resolve several problems in the historiography of the English Revolution and the current theory of revolutions.

Through a review of the literatures on countermovements and political opportunity, this article argues that this interaction increases when states enable but do not satisfy challengers. This article presents a general framework of theoretical propositions for understanding the interplay of movements and their opponents to animate and guide subsequent research.

The character and timing of these executions and the persecutions which preceded them were determined in part by changed objectives of the Inquisition, as well as by a differentiation process within medieval society. The which craze answered the need for a redefinition of moral boundaries, as a result of the profound changes in the medieval social order. The fact that these executions and the accompanying demonological theories enjoyed widespread and popular acceptance can be explained through the anomie which permeated society at that time. While these conditions provided the intellectual, cognitive background for the witch-hunts,economic and demographic changes, together with the emotional need for a target, explain why the witch-hunts were directed at women.

Stochastic models based on the existing research literature are developed to derive numerous empirical predictions about why different U.S. cities have different plea bargaining systems.

One such initiative-the Accident Compensation Act of 1972-has been something of a revolution in social policy, as it abolished the whole field of tort law with respect to accident injury, covers all accident-related costs for all citizens, and provides earnings-related compensation for all earnings lost. The paper analyzes how the act, first framed in the interests of monopoly capital, was reshaped through struggles both outside and within the state.

Equating rationalization with cultural homogenization and liquidation of particularity, Nietzsche saw "decadence" where modern social theorists saw progress. He held that sociology drapes cultural domination, regimentation, and exhaustion with the appearance of legitimacy. This essay explores his views about the depletion of social resources stressed in modern theory. It elaborates his "antisociology" and then traces the impact of this framework on three divergent currents of social theory. Nietzsche is read against the backdrop of modern theory in order to explore his continuing challenge to this tradition and his relevance to sociology.

It is often assumed that economic and social changes accompanying industrialization will drastically weaken parental power and thus reduce the support from adult children to parents. The data in this article, however, show that the vast majority of married children, both sons and daughters, provided net financial suppor for their parents during the previous year. The socioeconomic characteristics of the parents and children in the families where financial transfers occurred indicate that the altruism/corporate group model best portrays intergenerational transactions during the period of rapid economic growth.

It argues that prior action develops a consciousness that becomes a resource in future action. However, this enhanced consciousness must be mobilized through a protest organization for action to occur. Data on 123 couties in South Korea that peasant uprisings in 1946 were functions of the degree of peasant experience in protest-particularly tenancy disputes in the 1930s-and the effectiveness of mobilization by people's committees. These findings demonstrate the relevance of resource mobilization theory in an authoritarian Third World context.

I argue that, on the contrary, commitments to traditional cultural values and immediate communal relations are crucial to many radical movements, (a)because these commitments provide populations with the extent of internal social organization necessary to concerted, radical collective action, and (b) because the largely defensive goals of these movements must be radically incompatible with the introduction of modern capitalist-dominated social formations. Reformism is the characteristic stance of the modern working class, for both social and cultural reasons.

Clark	American Journal of Sociology	81	3	1975-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 584-600	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The authors suggest an explanation of police-civilian behavior based on a normative and interpersonal construct rather than on a psychological construct. Police behavior must be explained in terms of the rules which order their relations with civilians and which are usually mutually acknowledged by both. Among these rules the authors posit that in a typical encounter relations are governed by ansymmetrical status norm when deference exchange is involved. This norm effects various statuses in defferent ways. Data from an extesive study of police-civilianencounters in which the process of interaction was coded using a special interaction process analysis category system are used to test hypotheses derived from the theory.

Clark	American Journal of Sociology	84	5	1979-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1057-1077	The University of Chicago Press	fla		A series of cultural indicators reveals the similarity of general population literary preferences and the dissimilarity of elite literary tastes in France and the United States. The distinctive associations of literary activities with French and American elites are responsible for the distinctive characters of French and American Literary cultures. Whereas French literary culture is sustained by strong ties to centrally located governmental and traditional elites, American literary culture is defined by its support from dispered private elites. As these ties to elites define literary and influence literature, they are supported by the social and political organization of French and American society. Recent social and political changes have modified traditional patterns of support for literature and have attenued but not effaced certain distinctive features of French and American literary cultures.

This paper offers a different and more direct approach to this issue by analyzing public perceptions of criminal injustice and by assessing the capacity of conflict theory to explain them. Our analysis is based on a national survey, and it focuses on the race, class, and status positions of the respondents, with class position measured in neo-Marxian terms. Three major findings are (i) that black Americans are considerably more likely than white Americans to perceive criminal injustice; (ii) that regardless of race, members of the surplus population are significantly more likely than members of other classes to perceive criminal injustice; and (iii) that class position conditions the relationship of race to the perception of criminal injustice, with the division between the races in these perceptions being most acute in the professional managerial class. These findings constitute substantial evidence that race and class conflict exist with regard to issues of criminal injustice, and that neither kind of conflict can properly be understood without consideration of the other. Implications for Marxist and non-Marxist criminologies are indicated.

The resource that has received the most attention is economic concentration, but there is little agreement about the precise form of concentration that matters. In an attempt to find the most useful image of the state, this study looks at the connection between the aggregate concentration of assets among the leading manufacturing firms as well as the rate of business investment and taxes on business. Time-series regressions computed on U.S. national level data show that theories of the state that emphasize the independet activities of private investors are not supported. Instead, the aggrgate concentration of assets, as measured by the share of assets held by the leading 100 firms, has a strong negative influence on effective corporate tax rates. These results are consistent with the theory that heightened aggregate concentration helps corporations organize to attain their political demands.

General characteristics of the problem of development and definitions of the term are discussed in the introductory sections. The perspectives reviewed are labeled "development as social differentiation," "development as enactment of values," and "development as liberation from dependency." The main trend noted is movement from earlier extrapolations of theories based on the unique European experience to more historically grounded analyses. Recent approaches to development are not without limitations, and these are reviewed, as are those of earlier evolutionary and psychosocial perspectives.

Bonjean, Judy Corder	American Journal of Sociology	91	1	1985-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 129-150	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article tests Rosabeth Kanter's hypotheses that (a) promotion opportunity in organizations is related to several adaptive attitudes and bahaviors, (b) women have less promotion opportunity, (c) women are more likely to display the adaptations, and (d) when opportunity is controlled these gender differences are eliminated, using data from 897 employees in six offices of a government agency. Low opportunity was moderately related to bitter dissatisfaction concerning the promotion system and weakly related as predicted to four of eight remaining measures of these adaptations. Although gender was strongly related to occupational level, the segregation of women in lower-level career ladders was accompanied by roghly equal promotion opportunities for both sexes within the career ladders in which they were concentrated. Gender was moderately related to desire for security and interpersonal support at work, but is was related only weakly to four of the remaining measures of adaptations and related to two of these in the reverse of the expected directions. The sources of these findings in the structure of bureaucratic labor markets and the implications of the results are discussed.

The claim to face may rest on the basis of status, whether ascribed or achieved, and on personal or nonpersonal factors; it may also vary according to the group with which a person is interacting. Basic differences are found between the processes involved in gaining versus losing face. While it is not a necessity for one to strive to gain face, losing face is a serious matter which will, in varying degrees, affect one's ability to function effectively in society. Face is lost when the individual, either through his action or that of people closely related to him, fails to meet essential requirements placed upon him by virtue of the social position he occupies. In contrast to the ideology of individualism, the question of face frequently arises beyond the realm of individual responsibility and subjective volition. Reciprocity is inherent in face behavior, wherein a mutually restrictive, even coercive, power is exerted upon each member of the social network. It is argued that face behavior is universal and that face should be utilized as a construct of central importance in the social sciences.

Thomas	American Journal of Sociology	88		1982-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. S86-S112	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Recent analyses of changes in the organization of work and authority relations have stimulated a concern for extending and elaborating a theory of the labor process under capitalism. Works by Braverman, Edwards, and Burawoy, in particular, have made significant, though divergent, steps in that direction. It is argued in this paper, however, that their works do not go far enough in connecting issues of race, gender, and citizenship (political inequality) with structures of control over the labor process. An analysis of data from a case study of the labor process in an agribusiness (lettuce) industry is employed to highlight the importance of citizenship and gender as statuses constructed external to economic organizations but applied internal to them. Three principal arguments are derived from that case study: (1) that differences in citizenship status and gender serve to distinguish among labor market participants; (2) that nonmarket processes affect not only the distribution of individuals into positions in the labor process but also provide distinct advantages to employers in the creation and maintenance of different labor processes; and (3) that citizenship and gender have a material basis external to the labor process, that is, they are not simply labels attached to workers. The findings from the case study are then used to suggest alternative directions for labor process theory and research.

DiPrete	American Journal of Sociology	93	1	1987-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 119-140	The University of Chicago Press	fla		During the 20th century, the process of professionalization widened the status distance between upper- and lower-level jobs in both public and private organizations. This process included the development of formal career lines for both administrative and professional jobs distinct from the career lines for lower-level positions. However, a statistical analysis of personnel outcomes for the 15 largest agencies of the federal government during 1962-77 shows that lower-level employees frequently moved into entry-level administrative positions. This suggests that upward-mobility programs begun during these years successfully countered professionalization trends and allowed the proportion of entry-level administrative positions filled internally to increase. Women and minorities were the primary beneficiaries. The implications for further career advancement are discussed.

Morgan	American Journal of Sociology	88	1	1982-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 88-113	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper develops a conceptual scheme that merges the qualitatively stated propositions of Blau's recent axiomatic theory of social structure with the quantitative approach of social network analysis. The conceptual scheme is used to describe a set of inescapable features of intergroup and intragroup relations. We examine, both qualitatively and formal equations, the tautologies that govern contact rates and network densities for any population that can be divided into two categories. We show how assumptions about the partitioning of populations into social categories can be translated into precise probabilities of contact within and between categories. We present several illustrations of the immodest implications of apparently modest assumptions. Following simulations of a high school within an adult community and an old boy network within a larger bureaucracy, we apply our conceptual scheme to actual data on social relations within a regional elite. Accompanying these examples is a discussion of new perspective on reference groups, as well as a development of a common exception to Blau's theory. We conclude with a formal statement of the substantive propositions that follow from our conceptual scheme.

While the findings confirm the results of other recent research that the nuclear family predominated in preindustrial societies, they also emphasize the need to focus on variation. Methodological problems of working with this kind of data are discussed, as are the implications of the results for the study of social change.

The second part compares three techniques for changing expectations. Two of them, verbal statements of equality and a demonstration of equality on a related task, had no effect in the experiment conducted. The third, however, a demonstration of female superiority on a related task, not only changed influence patterns in the experimental group but also transferred to new partners in a second experiment.

Narrative uses temporal order to organize information about events and to foster their understanding but is insufficiently systematic to substitute for sociological explanation. This article illustrates a new interpretative heuristic for the computer- assisted analysis of qualitative narrative sequences, "event-structure analysis,"that infuses narrative with greater rigor and explicitness. Through the analysis of a lynching that took place in Mississippi in 1930, this article shows how event-structure analysis can be used to build replicable and generalizable causal interpretations of events.

Turner	American Journal of Sociology	84	1	1978-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1-23	The University of Chicago Press	fla		As a complement to the familiar idea of self-conception, the concept of role-person merger is proposed as a more behavioral approach to understanding the social construction of personality than has been taken previously. Person and role are said to be merged when there is a systematic pattern involving failure of role compartmentalization, resistance to abandoning a role in the face of advantageous alternative roles, and the acquisition of role-appropriate attitudes. Three principles concerning appearance, effect, and consistency provide the basis for a series of propositions concerning interactive determinants of merger. Three other principles-consensual frames of reference, autonomy and favorable evaluation, and investment- provide the basis for propositions concerning individual determinants of role-person merger.

The proper aggregation of rows and columns is portrayed as the fundamental theoretical issue in mobility table analysis, rather than as an exogenous "given" to be decided upon prior to the construction of explicit models. Homogeneity of mobility within and between classes, class hierarchy, and tangible boundedness are the central themes. These themes are implemented in loglinear models and applied in the analysis of large 17-category), intergenerational mobility tables. Four such tables from the studies of Blau and Duncan and of Featherman and Hauser are fitted acceptably. Seven falsifiable hypotheses about the social class structure of occupational mobility are identified and assessed comparatively within the new framework.

Three major findings emerge. First, antiblack prejudice (as measured by questions in the General Social Survey) has declined in recent years; this is true for the South, for the non-South, and for the United States as a whole. Second, the decline in prejudice stems from cohort replacement (the replacement of older, more prejudiced birth cohorts with younger, less prejudiced ones) as well as from attitude change itself; in fact, in some instances cohort replacement is the more important source of the decline. Third, antiblack prejudice is declining more rapidly in the South; as a result, the regional difference in antiblack prejudice is shrinking.

Participation was fostered by elite education; membership i elite clubs; and growing up in northeastern, urban, and big-business families. Cultural origins (region and size of birthplace, parent's religion, and generation) also exerted direct influence on economic attitudes.

The ananlysis first examines the relationship, between environmental phenomena and the patterns of founding and failure observed in the lives of 2,168 newspaper organizations. To study another relationship, that between organizational environments and performance levels, four long-lived newspapers were investigated separately. The findings show that institutional environmental variables, especially political turmoil, strongly affect the rates of founding and failure but only weakly affect performance. In contrast, task environmental variables are more closely associated with the performances of individual organizations and less with the organizational demographics of the industry.	
10.2307/2778582	10.2307/2778582	The Utilitarians Revisited	Charles Camic	American Journal of Sociology	85	3	1979-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 516-550	The University of Chicago Press	fla		For generations sociologists have attacked utilitarian social theory as inadequate theoretically. At the same time, their presentist orientation toward sociology's past has prevented a direct examination of the utilitarians in their own right. This paper rejects that orientation and investigates the social theory of the major utilitarians. David Hume, Adam Smith, Jeremy Bentham, and John Stuart Mill. No alleged characteristic of utilitarianism-from the atomistic, rationalistic model of social action to the failure to solve the problem of order-adduced in the traditional attack upon it is actually found in the work of the utilitarians. The paper then outlines the historical process whereby the prevailing mythology concerning utilitarianism developed. The hallmark of that process is not the cumulative development of social theories but the displacement, in changing cultural and social circumstances, of the concerns of utilitarian social theory-a displacement succesively evident in the work of Spencer, early American social scintists, and Park and climaxing in Parson's The Structure of Social Action. The paper concludes by offering a sociological interpretation of Parson's selective account of utilitarian social theory and by identifying the constricting, but still pervasive, theoretical implications of that account.

The first set of three theorems is concerned with the effect of status characteristics on the degree of equality and inequality that obtains among the members of a task group. Included here is a result that establishes a direct relation between status inconsistency and power and prestige equality. The second set is concerned with the relations between different types of status and task structures. The first of these theorems deals with the relations between task assignments and status expectancies, while the second describes relations between status expectancies and status-task associations. While variants of these theorems have been formulated previously as theoretical assumptions, now for the fist time they are shown to be derivable from more basic status organizing principles.

Harer, Cathy Streifel	American Journal of Sociology	94	4	1989-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 803-831	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper examines the age/crime distribution to determine whether there is a single pattern that is constant over time and across crime categories. Using arrest data of the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports for the periods of 1940, 1960, and 1980, the article compares parameters including age of maximum criminality, overall shape of the age-crime curve, and rate of decline from the peak age. Not only is there variation by crime type when the age-crime statistics for 1980 are examined; there is considerable change between 1940 and 1980. The most significant change has been the progressive concentration of offending among the young; this suggests increasing discontinuity in the transition from adolescence to adulthood in modern times. Variations found in the age distribution for different crime types support the traditional sociological view that, although crime rates typically decline throughout life after the initial rise in adolescence, certain crimes peak later, or decline more slowly, or both.

Zelizer	American Journal of Sociology	95	2	1989-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 342-377	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Classic interpretations of the development of the modern world portray money as a key instrument in the rationalization of social life. Money is reductively defined as the ultimate objectifier, homogenizing all qualitative distrinctions into an abstract quantity. This paper shows the limits of such a purely utilitarian conception of "market money." A model of "special monies" is proposed to examine the extraeconomic, social basis of modern money. The article argues that, while money does indeed transform items, values, and sentiments into numerical cash equivalents, money itself is shaped in the process. Culture and social structure mark the quality of money by institutionalizing controls, restrictions, and districtions in the sources, uses, modes of allocation, and even the quantity of money. The changing social meaning and structure of domestic money, specifically married women's money in the United States, 1870-1930, are examined as an empirical case study of a special money.

David Lewis	American Journal of Sociology	85	2	1979-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 261-287	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The concept "I" in George Herbert Mead's theory of social self has been an object of considerable discussion and dispute. This paper argues that the two most common interpretations of the Meadian "I" misconsture Mead's intent by failing to place the concept within the context of Mead's philosophy of social behaviorism. Consequently, these interpreters have critized positions that are attributed to Mead but which he did not propose. The social behaviorist interpretation of the "I" is more consistent with the textual evidence. By extending and slightly reformulating Mead's theory, the latter part of the paper aims to show that the social behaviorist interpretation is also more theoretically fertile and methodologically applicable.

Full-period equations show no significant direct effect of percentage Catholic (culture clash) or population size (hierarchical diffussion) and only a modest impact of city age (modernization). A strong effect from average annual manufacturing wages is found, but in a direction contrary to that posited by the class-conflict hypothesis. The variable affecting transition rates most strongly appears to be regional adoption percentages, an indicator of neighborhood diffusion. These findings suggest revisions of the conventional image of the municipal reform experience.

Zald	American Journal of Sociology	82	6	1977-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1212-1241	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Past analysis of social movements and social movement organizations has normally assumed a close link between the frustrations or grievances of a collectivity of actors and the growth and decline of movement activity. Questioning the theoretical centrality of this assumption directs social movement analysis away from its heavy emphasis upon the social psychology of social movement participants; it can then be more easily integrated with structural theories of social process. This essay presents a set of concepts and related propositions drawn from a resource mobilization perspective. It emphasizes the variety and sources of resources; the relationship of social movements to the media, authorities, and other parties; and the interaction among movement organizations. Propositions are developed to explain social movement activity at several levels of inclusiveness-the social movement sector, the social movement industry, and social movement organization.

This article takes imoprtant stepts toward resolving these issues with the use of pooled cross-sectional and time-series analyses. The findings are that various independent variables affect different measures of welfare state effort in different and theoretically meaningful ways. Of special importance are the contrasting effects of Christian democracy and social democracy on transfer payments, social benefits expenditure, and total government revenue. There is also a strong effect of constitutional structure on welfare state effort, a finding that provides the first solid support for the state-centered perspective in a quantitative analysis.

Analysis is based on montly data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) for the years 1984-86. The results reveal substantial labor market activity among single mothers on welfare not previously found in studies of welfare dynamics analyzing anual data. A majority of women work while they are on welfare, and more than two-thirds of welfare exist occur through work. Human capital investments are key determinants of welfare exits through work, while a large family size impedes particularly rapid job exits from welfare.

Telles	American Journal of Sociology	100	5	1995-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1199-1223	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article evaluates the impact of industrialization and urbanization on residential segregation by income among Brazilian metropolitan areas. Using data from the 1980 census of Brazil, the author finds that more-industrialized areas have lower segregation because they have lower income inequality. However, urbanization, particularly population size, explains most of the variation in segregation among metropolitan areas. The conclusion is that the extent of urbanization, which is dependent of industrialization, is key to understanding socioeconomic spatial inequalities in the large and rapidly growing cities of less-developed countries, but that conclusions regarding the effects of industrialization throught industrial location or investment in real estate have been overgeneralized.

Taylor	American Journal of Sociology	84	6	1979-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1401-1423	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Some scholars assume a radical discontinuity between the experiences of blacks in the United States and the experiences of immigrants ethnic groups in American cities. There is a tendency to see the situation of blacks in racial rather than in ethnic terms and to emphasize the conditions of racial oppresion and exploitation as exclusive sources of black sociocultural characteristics. This emphasis obscures the important role of migration, urbanization, and intergroup conflict in promoting a distinctive black ethnicity. Indeed, a review of the urban history of black populations in northern cities suggests that the phenomenon of black ethnogenesis was inspired by essentially the same structural conditions as the development of ethnic identities and communities among white ethnic populations in American cities.

This model differs from others in that it is derived from certain theoretical propositions concerning the roles of resources governing access to occupational positions. The model permits a decomposition of observed mobility structures into their two latent components: mobility mediated by generalized resources and mobility mediated by specific resources. This decomposition provides insights into generality and specificity in various structural characteristics of mobility such as channels of mobility, social distances in mobility, and barriers to mobility.

O'Malley	American Journal of Sociology	90	3	1984-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 624-639	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Blacks are more likely than whites to use the extreme response categories in Likert-type questionnaire items. This general tendency has important implications for black-white comparisons along self-esteem dimensions. Analyses of several large-scale nationally representative surveys of high school students reveal that (1) blacks score significantly higher than whites when the full-scale range is used in computing self-esteem scores, but (2) the black-white discrepancy disappears when a truncated scoring method is employed to control differences in the use of extreme response categories.

This paper explores determinants of grant getting, using a subsample draw from a 1972-73 general national survey of faculty in higher education. The findings show that grant getting depends primarily on productivity, secondarily on the inequalities in favor shown to specific fields, and very little on particularistic situational and personal status factors. The inevitable inequality of this meritocracy apparently is lessned by broad participation in grantsmanship.

Total family income is first classified by its four major sources: earnings of a male head, earnings of a wife or female head, earnings of other family members, and property or transfer income. Next, each potential source of intergroup differences is analyzed for male earnings and then for female earnings: differences in family structure, labor force participation, weeks employed, hours worked per week, and wage rates, For each factor, the ratio of each minority group's average value to that of white non-Hispanics is computed to determine where the overall income gaps arise. In order to adjust for group differences in demographic composition, Fisher's ideal index is also computed for the factors exhibiting sizable gaps.

Surgeon, Sara Lindholm, Phyllis Betts Otti, Amy Bridges	American Journal of Sociology	83	2	1977-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 425-442	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Both the literature on urban communities and that on local voluntary associations have focused on endogenous social processes: urban communities are seen as important loci of social integration and loca voluntary associations as aggregates of local interests spontaneusly coalescing to influence external agents. The current relevance of these perspectives, in view of the increasing scale of urban social organization, is questioned on the bais of observations from a community study of a well-defined south-side Chicago neighborhood. Information on the social networks and institutional affiliations of area residents indicate that social residence is a relatively unimportant source of social integration for modern urban residents. In this context, the genesis and role of local voluntary associations are frequently reversed: because there are no obvious points of contact based on informal social networks, external agents seeking to intervene in these neighborhoods must sponsor or even create local voluntary associations as sources of information and legitimation.

Wozniak	American Journal of Sociology	92	6	1987-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1461-1500	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Recent research shows that the crucial factor determining the rejection of former mental patients is their behavior rather than their stigmantized status. The study reported here, based on a vignette experiment (with a design that varies patient status with the nature of behavior), challenges this conclusion. Like previous research, it indicates that a simple assessment of labelings shows little effect on a social distance scale. However, when a measure of perceived dangerousness of mental patients is introduced, strong labeling effects emerge. Specifically, the data reveal that the lable of "previous hospitalization" fosters high social distance among those who perceive mental patients to be dangerous and low social distance among those who do not see patients as a threat. It appears that past investigators have missed these effects because they have averaged excessively lenient responses with excessively rejecting ones. This suggests that labels play an important role in how former mental patients are perceived and that labeling theory should not be dismissed as a framework for understanding social factors in mental illness.

This article outlines the theoretical presuppositions of network analysis. It also distinguishes between three different (implicit) models in the network literature of the interrelations of social structure, culture, and human agency. It concludes that only a strategy for historical explanation that synthesizes social structural and cultural analysis can adequately explain the formation, reproduction, and transformation of networks themselves. The article sketches the broad contours of such a theoretical synthesis in the conclusion.

Rosenbaum, Takehiko Kariya	American Journal of Sociology	94	6	1989-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1334-1365	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Market models posit that institutional linkages interfere with efficient labor markets. Many Japanese high schools have agreements with employers to hire their students, and this article examines the ties between Japanese schools and employers, the reasons they make these ties, and the criteria they use to select students. Interviews with teachers and recruiters indicate that the Japanese system shifts the competition for jobs from the labor market into schools and among schools, and employers also compete for dependable sources of labor. Multivariate analyses of surveys of 1,408 high schools and 964 seniors indicate that desirable jobs are allocated more on the basis of academic than nonacademic criteria, contrary to the predictions of some models. Moreover, contrary to a hypothesis that institutional linkages reduce achievement effects, achievement has greater effects on jobs with linked employers than on jobs with nonlinked employers. Institutional linkages differ from both economic market models and from sociological personal network models, and they have practical and theoretical implications for understanding the relationship between education and work.

Current approaches to this problem draw on Émile Durkheim and emphasize the way commemorative objects celebrate society's former glories. This article on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial deals with the way society assimilates past events that are less than glorious and whose memory induces controversy instead of consensus. The Vietnam War differed from other wars because it was politically controversial and morally questionable and resulted in defeat; it resembled other wars because it called out in participants the traditional virtues of courage, self-sacrifice, and honor. The task of representing these contrasting aspects of the war in a single monument was framed by the tension between contrasting memorial genres. Focusing on the discursive field out of which the Vietnam Veterans Memorial emerged, this analysis shows how opposing social constituencies articulated the ambivalence attending memories of the Vietnam War. Ambivalence was expressed not only in the Vietnam Veterans Memorial's design but also in the design of Vietnam War monuments later erected throughout the United States. These efforts to memorialize a divisive war, along with attempts in other nations to come to terms with the difficulties of their past, call into question Durkheim's belief that moral unity is the ultimate object of commemoration. The Vietnam Veterans Memorial and devices like it come into view not as symbols of solidarity but as structures that render more explicit, and more comprehensible, a nation's conflicting conceptions of itself and its past.

Macy	American Journal of Sociology	97	3	1991-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 808-843	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The Prisoner's Dilemma formalizes the social trap that arises when individually rational choices aggregate with mutually undesirable consequences. The game-theoretic solution centers on the opportunity for tacit collusion in repeated play. However, not all actors grasp the strategic implications of future interaction. Accordingly, this study reformulates the game as a stochastic learning model in which the behavior of interdependent actors is constinually shaped by sanctions and cues generated by their interaction. Computer simulations of a two-person game show that adaptive actors are led into a social trap more readily than are fully rational actors, but they are also better at finding their way out. Prosocial norms appear to be a consequence rather than cause of cooperation but useful in promoting forgiveness of random deviance. The model is then elaborated as an N-way Prisoner's Dilemma. Simulations show how the effects of network size, density, mobility, and anonymity derive from a fundamental principle of collective action, that is, the need to reduce the number of choices that must be fortuitously coordinated in order to escape noncooperative equilibrium. The results also suggest how network structure might evolve in tandem with the cooperation it facilitates.

Gillmore, Toshio Yamagishi	American Journal of Sociology	89	2	1983-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 275-305	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the structural determinants of power in exchange networks, along with research findings from laboratory experiments and a computer simulation of bargaining in network structures. Two theoretical traditions are dealth with: (1) point centrality in graph-theoretic representations of structure, as an approach to power distributions; and (2) power dependence principles applied to exchange networks. Measures of centrality available in the literature have the advantage of being easily applied to large and complex networks. In contrast, power dependence concepts were conceived for use in microsociology and are found to be cumbersome in the analysis of complex networks. But despite the relative difficulty of applying power-dependence theory to network structures, that approach generates hypotheses about power distributions which are confirmed at nearly every point in a laboratory experiment with five-person networks and at every point in a computer simulation of networks too large for laboratory study. In contrast, centrality measures applied to the type of networks studied fail to predict power distributions. Although centrality measures might predict power in some networks, their generality is limited. Toward resolution of the issues raised, this study offers two theoretical points: (1) a distinction between two different principles of "connection" in social networks suggests that current measures of centrality might predict power in one type of network but not in the other; and (2) it offers a first step toward a fusion of power-dependence theory and structural centrality in a way which might be general across networks of both types.

This disagreement is linked to politics and social structure, with older, high SES, politically conservative respondents preferring markedly higher pay for elite occupations, but usually not preferring lower pay for ordinary jobs.

These patterns have been attributed to "period effects" since they are similar in all population subgroups. Using longitudinal data on a sample of American men, this article investigates the effect of the World War II period on divorce by estimating the effects of three aspects of war mobilization-entry intro the armed forces, timing of this entry, and combat experience. The analysis shows that veterans were more likely to divorce than nonveterans but that marriages begun at other times. For veterans who were wed by time of entry, the risk of divorce was greater among those who entered relatively late in life and those who experienced combat.

Stephen Warner	American Journal of Sociology	83	6	1978-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1317-1349	The University of Chicago Press	fla		By means of an examination and a revision of Parsons's "action frame work," this paper offers to mediate the debate between Parsons and the critics of his Durkheim-Weber "convergence" thesis and to present a more satisfactory rendering of Durkheim-Weber continuities. First, Parsons's Structure of Social Action is scrutinized. It is shown that Parsons so construes Hobbes that the "problem of order" for social theory is answered by the concept of internalized normative motivation. As a consequence of this focus, Parsons derogates an analytically independent "cognitive" element in action and elegates cognitive matters either to the "scientific" or "normative" orientations. Second, the interrelated series of articles by Pope, Cohen, and Hazelrigg are shown to rest on framework assumptions similar to Parsons's own, while drawing nearly opposite conclusions, rendering Durkheim a "positivist" and Weber a "utilitarian" in Parsons's sense of these terms. Third, a "redefined theory of action" is proposed which acknowledges explicitly the analytically independent role of the cognitive element in action. Some course-of-action statements drawn from Durkheim and Weber and focusing on the cognitive structuring of the "situation" and of "end" are presented and shown to involve compatible reasoning. Some implications are suggested.

The political conservatism of the religiously orthodox relative to theological progressives is limited to issues of schooling, sexuality, reproductive rights, and the gendered division of labor. the orthodox are no more conservative than progressives on issues concerning racial equality, and, in part because they draw disproportionately on the disadvantaged of society, the orthodox are more liberal than moral progressives on many economic issues.

To address this problem, we organized recent results into two empirical generalizations about status and nonverbal task cues and offered an initial proposition to account for them in terms of expectation states theory. In an experimental test of the proposition that the task cue level of one actor in relation to that of another is a direct function of one person's expectation advantage relative to the other's, we found that subjects' verbal latency and initial gaze (two task cues) varied with the expectation advantage created by differences in the tatus characteristics of sex.

Meyer, Brian Rowan	American Journal of Sociology	83	2	1977-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 340-363	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Many formal organizational structures arise as reflections of rationalized institutional rules. The elaboration of such rules in modern states and societies accounts in part for the expansion and increased complexity of formal organizational structures. Institutional rules function as myths which organizations incorporate, gaining legitimacy, resources, stability, and enhanced survival prospects. Organizations whose structures become isomorphic with the myths of the institutional environment-in contrast with those primarily structured by the demands of technical production and exchange-decrease internal coordination and control in order to maintain legitimacy. Structures are decoupled from each other and from ongoing activities. In place of coordination, inspection, and evaluation, a logic of confidence and good faith is employed.

Miller	American Journal of Sociology	85	1	1979-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 66-94	The University of Chicago Press	fla		For employed women, job conditions that encourage self-direction are related to effective intellectual functioning and an open, flexible orientation to others, while those tha constrain opportunities for self direction are related to ineffective intellectual functioning and a rigid social orientation. Moreover, several types of job pressures and uncertainties are related to less effective intellectual functioning, unfavorable evaluations of self, or a rigid social orientation. These relationships do not result from social selection, pay, status, or social circumstances and personal preferences, and they are of magnitudes similar to those for men. Causal analysis demonstrates that job conditions not only correlate with but actually affect psychological functioning. For women, as for men, occupational conditions have a decided psychological impact.

Actually, however, specific societal conditions can explain the extent of anomie which actors observe, if their observations are interpreted as social constructions of societal normlessness. This research concerned variations in constructions of anomie by workers in four countries according to extent of industrialization, the workers' place in the skill hierarchy, and their pattern of social system involvement. Anomie observed was related to the extend of industrialization, but place in the skill hierarchy and the pattern of system involvement were associated with anomie differently in each country. In the less developed countries, beliefs concerning societal anomie were not related to skill level or pattern of system involvement, as in the United States, but to political ideology and the ability of workers to see effective linkages between union and national politics.

In particular, certain facial features, tallness, and an athletic physique are perceived as dominant characteristic. Do such physical features affect social mobility? Do dominant-looking men advance to higher ranks in the military hierarchy than submissive-looking men? The yearbook of the West Point Class of 1950 provides facial portraits of the graduating cadets, allows close approximations of their height and athletic prowess, and gives their military ranks while at the academy; their ultimate ranks appear in West Point's Register of Graduates. This paper finds a substantial correlation between facial appearance and military rank while at West Point, as well as several weaker relationships.

The vital events of organizational populations (founding, dissolution, and merger) cause substantial shifts in populations of employing organizations and jobs, thereby greatly altering opportunity structures. Founding creates jobs; dissolution and merger destroy jobs. These processes have strong direct effects on employees in new and failed organizations. Moreover, these processes have strong indirect effects on employees in other organizations, which can be best understood by extending vacancy-chain models to encompass industry dynamics. Analysis of job mobility in one industry generally supports the theory.

The new methods can be applied to determine whether the particular variables of interest can be expressed in intrinsic metric terms, using the pattern of the observed joint distribution of variables in a cross classification table as evidence pertaining to the possible intrinsic metric character of the variables. These methods are related to, but different from, (1) methods developed earlier in connection with Guttman's approach to scale analysis, (2) methods developed earlier in connection with Lazarsfeld's approach to latent-class analysis, and (3) methods developed more recently in connection with the loglinear approach. These three approaches appear, at first sight, to be very different from one another, but, with the introduction of the new methods described in the present paper, we shall be able to see more clearly how the three approaches are related to one another, and also how the new methods described here improve on the methods obtained with each of the three earlier approaches.

Bielby	American Journal of Sociology	93	5	1988-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1031-1059	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Recent developments in human capital theory suggest that men and women differ in how they allocate effort to work activities. This paper uses the 1973 and 1977 Quality of Employment Surveys to test the assumtion that women allocate less effort to work because of their family and household responsibilities. Regression and ordered probit analyses show that, on average, women allocate more effort to work than do men. Further, the sex difference is substantial when men and women with comparable family situations and market human capital are compared. The paper discusses how experiments on sex differences in standards of "personal entitlement" and research on sex-segregated workplaces provide an alternative to the economists' perspective. Finally, the paper argues for an integration of human capital models, research on social equity, and structural theories of work organization in order to provide a more complete explanation of men's and women's orientations toward work and family.

The Greenberg A index is used to measure diversity  in each nation, and the magnitude of change is determined through a procedure proposed by Coleman. Diversity declines over time in the majority of cases, but there is considerable variation between nations and in 14 cases diversity has increased. Accordingly, various national characteristics are considered to see whether they help account for the magnitude and direction of change observed among nations. Two factors, the spatial isolation of language groups and official educational policies, have fairly high correlations with changes in diversity. In addition, several geopolitical factors have affected diversity change in the past: age of nation, boundary changes, forced population movements, and World War II. Two specially puzzling results are the comparatively rapid rate of mother-tongue change in the United States and the failure of national development to have much bearing on the course of mother-tongue diversity. A theoreticl approach accounting for these events is described.

Rossi	American Journal of Sociology	84	3	1978-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 565-590	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The social standing of families in our society is the result of collective evaluations of certain characteristics of family members. The most important characteristics are known to be the occupational and educational attainments of both husband and wife. Beyond such achieved characteristics, there are many ascribed characteristics which have been presumed to have importance in the determination of a family's social standing. This paper presents the results of research on the relative importance of a number of achieved and ascribed characteristics in the evaluation of family units. Social origins as indicated by parental social status and individual achievements as indicated by educational and occupational attainments are studied for their relative importance to the process of status attribution. We shwo that achievement is more important than ascription. However, the latter is quite important in the status evaluation of families in our society. Further, it is apparent that families are evaluated on the basis of well-under-stood and agreed-upon principles.

Within the general patterns of rankings, however, specific differences are found, and these reflect not only the specific skills required and resources valued at a particular historical moment in development but also the social effects of recent political events. These findings suggest a general correspondence of prestige rankings among major occupations across societies and that attention should be paid to the society's geopolitical characteristics and its recent historical experiences. Finally, a series of predictive equations are constructed to estimate prestige scores for all occupations in urban China.

Hannan, Nancy Brandon Tuma, Lyle P. Groeneveld	American Journal of Sociology	84	3	1978-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 611-633	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Using data from the Seattle and Denver Income-Maintenance Experiments, this paper discusses the effects of income and changes in income on marital dissolution. In an earlier article, we presented evidence of an experimental impact on marital dissolution and discussed how the pattern of effects found could be accounted for by nonlinear income and independence effects. The income effect decrease the marital dissolution rate by increasing the family's economic well being. The independence effect increase the dissolution rate by reducing the economic dependence of the more dependent partner (usually the wife) on the marriage. In this article, we present a model of nonlinear income and independence effects that accounts for much of the experimental-control difference reported in the earlier paper. According to the model, the effect of an income-maintenance program on marital dissolution depends not only upon the magnitude of the payment a couple receives but also on their level of income before the program, the level of the wife's independence, and the magnitude of the change in the wife's independence.

Hopcroft	American Journal of Sociology	99	6	1994-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1559-1595	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Agrarian change in late medieval England (about 1300-1500) was an important precursor of the agricultural revolution of later centuries. Recent historical scholarship shows pronounced regional differences in agrarian change during this period. This article uses both historical evidence and the results of a multivariate analysis to criticize various explanations of regional differences in agraian change. Neither population density, nor ecology, nor access to markets, nor class relations can adequately explain the regional pattern. A crucial factor shaping the regional pattern of agrarian change was the local social organization of production (or the "field system").

Baker	American Journal of Sociology	97	6	1992-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1639-1657	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Shadow education is a set of educational activities that occur out-side formal schooling and are designed to enhance the student's formal school career. Analyses of data from a longitudinal study of high school seniors in Japan indicate that students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds are more likely to participate in shadow education and that students who participate in certain forms of shadow education are more likely to attend university. Expanding theories of allocation to incorporate shadow education may enhance the study of how students are allocated to places in formal schooling and how social advantages are transferred across generations.

Included are (1) a discussion of "presentist" and "historicist" approaches to the history of sociological thought; (2) a criticism of presentist "statements of contribution" in the secondary literature on the Elementary Forms; (3) an assessment of Merton's distinction between the "history" and the "systematics" of sociological theory; (4) a reconsideration of "contextual" approaches to classical social theory; (5) the proposal of a new approach to the history of sociological theory, illustrated by a very tentative reinterpretation of Durkheim's theory of sacrifice; and (6) a concluding section on the value for sociology itself of an authentic history of sociological thought.

Gaitz	American Journal of Sociology	80	5	1975-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1192-1211	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Drawing on the findings of Orum (1966) and Olsen (1970), this study hypothesizes that, because of a process of "compensation" or "ethnic identification," members of disadvantaged ethnic groups have higher levels of social and political participation than persons of the same social class who are members of the dominant social group. Data taken from a community survey only partially support the hypothesis with regard to 11 participation variables. When social class is controlled, black levels of participation generally exceed or equal those of whites; however, levels of participation among Mexican-Americans tend to be lower than those of whites. Several explanations which might account for these discrepant findings are discussed.

Laumann, Richard Senter	American Journal of Sociology	81	6	1976-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1304-1338	The University of Chicago Press	fla		After briefly reviewing some general theoretical issues in analyzing systems of social inequality and stratification, we propose a typology of forms of class and status consciousness. A specific procedure employing subjective social distance scales is proposed as an empirical strategy for assessing different forms of status consciousness and exploring their implications for class consciousness and other political and social attitudes. To evaluate the empirical and theoretical utility of this strategy, we report a West German replication of an American study in which substantial evidence is found for a remarkable degree of cross-national similarity in the subjective social distance responses accorded occupations varying in prestige and socioeconomic status, regardless of the class position of the respondent. Some working- and middle-class persons did, indeed, prefer to interact with members of their own class rather than with persons in higher- (or lower-) status occupations; and this manifestation of corporate status consciousness appeared to be specifically linked to other political and social views consonant with such consciousness. But these were relatively minor, albeit systematic, departures from the general picture of prestige-or upward-oriented preferences for intimate interaction at all class levels-what we have called a competitive status consciousness that appeared to be pervasive among lower-status persons in both the American and the German communities studied. While the results can hardly be regarded as definitive, they help to clarify a number of issues in studying subjective consciousness of the class and status order and suggest the promise of further work employing the approach.

This assumption implies that observed distributions of organizations at any point in time reflect the unique outcomes of underlying systematic processes, independent of historical details. In an attempt to assess the plausibility of this assumption in the context of organizational evolution, the authors use a well-established model to simulate trajectories of competing organizational populations. The findings show that path-dependent processes can often generate outcomes other than those implied by historical efficiency. Implications for theory and research are discussed.

Seven hundred male and female college students wrote stories to randomly assigned cues concerning success of a male or female medical student. Content analysis showed that the majority of stories contained "fear of success" imagery; there were no significant differences in the percentages of women and men respondents including such imagery in their stories. These and other findings underscore the need for careful examination and replications before tentative concepts in popular or controversial areas become conventional wisdom.

The reanalysis of the experimental data distinguishes between the experimental treatment in the form of the "pure" negative income tax and the treatment plans that involved an experimental training program. All the time periods of the experiment are used, with allowance for the timing of the marital dissolution in the inferences, and with allowance for attrition. The conclusion of this paper is that the plans (specifically, the negative income tax plans in the experiment) had no effect on the rate of marital dissolutions among the "treatment" couples relative to the control couples.

Bielby	American Journal of Sociology	97	5	1992-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1241-1267	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article tests competing explanations for why wives in dualearner couples are less willing than husbands to relocate for a better job. Hypotheses are derived from a neoclassical market model that assumes spouses maximize family well-being and a sociological alternative that emphasizes the mediating function fo gender-role-ideology in decision making by couples. Results from a maximum-likelihood probit model that uses data from the 1977 Quality of Employment Survey indicate that couples' orientation to the "provider role" shapes how they respond to job opportunities. A husband's potential loss from a move appears to deter wives from capitalizing on opportunities at a new location, but a wife's potential loss does not deter husbands. However, differences by gender are substantially smaller among men and women who reject traditional notions about husbands'and wives' roles within families. Implications for future theoretical development and empirical research are discussed.

Freudenburg	American Journal of Sociology	92	1	1986-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 27-63	The University of Chicago Press	fla		One of the most basic characteristics of a community's social structure is the proportion of its residents who are acquainted with one another-in the terminology of this paper, the community's "density of acquaintanceship." Although versions of this variable have been discussed for at least three-quarters of a century, quantitative studies have found little evidence that it has any significant consequences for psychosocial adjustment. Using a different focus, however, may lead to different conclusions. Drawing from a study of rapid community growth, this paper reports that a marked decline in the density of acquaintanceship did in fact lead to significant consequences-but that the effects were strongest in areas other than psychological functioning. Changes were particularly evident in control of deviance, socialization of the young, and care for the community's weaker members. psychosocial impacts, by contrast, were lessened by the continuing vitality of intimate social supports. The paper concludes that the density of acquaintanceship variable warrants systematic but refocused investigation in the future.

We show that "development towns," a category of new settlements established to achieve population dispersal and immigrant absorption, have influenced (a) the areal distributions of different ethnic (country-of origin) group, (b) the tendency for each group to be concentrated in certain industries, and (c) the occupational opportunities available to the members of an ethnic population. We also review the relevance of this analysis for understanding ethnic stratification in America.

This paper reviews these studies in order to discover what can be concluded about these relationships. Our strategy is as follows: First, we discuss the conceptualization of the four main variables at issue. Second, we discuss the differences in the research designs and measuments in the studies. Third, we compare their results and explain contradictory and inconsistent findings. Fourth, we present some new analyses based on this review. We conclude: (1) The effect of direct foreign investment and aid has been to increase economic inequality within countries. (2) Flows of direct foreing investment and aid have had a short-term effect of increasing the relative rate of economic growth of countries. (3) Stocks of direct foreign investment and aid have had the cumulative, long-term effect of decreasing the relative rate of economic growth of countries. (4) This relationship has been conditional on the level of development of countries. The stocks of foreign investment and aid have had negative effects in both richer and poorer developing countries, but the effect is much stronger within the richer than the poorer ones. (5) These relationships hold independently of geographical area.

The former, "dispositional," approach involves theoretical assumptions compatible with a Durkheimian social theory; the "situational" approach is characteristic of a more Marxian set of theoretical assumptions. Data from a national sample of workers are analyzed to show that perceived intrinsic and extrinsic sources of satisfaction have powerful effects on overall job satisfaction irrespective of educational background and that intrinsic satisfaction is a powerful determinant of overall satisfaction among members of occupational groups, while extrinsic sources of satisfaction vary in importance among different groups. Entrinsic satisfaction is shown to be much more important as a determinant of overall satisfaction among unskilled, semiskilled, and clerical workers than it is among skilled and professional workers, a finding that is interpreted as reflecting the differential in opportunities for instrinsic satisfaction for instrinsic satisfaction associated with each group. More generally, the findings support the Marxian rather than the Durkheimian model.

In this paper we show that the majority of detailed census occupations conform to one of five basic age profiles. Further, these age profiles have meaning as they derive from the operation of well-defined institutional forces. We discuss the relevance of industry for a refined understanding of occupational-age patterns and conclude with some observations about the likely consequence of a change in teh age of compulsory retirement for the age distributions of different occupations.

I begin by examining, from a general sociological perspective, the socialization of effective experience and expression. Several major symbolic interactionist propositions are then used to analyze the emergent, constructed character of the actor's experience of emotion and the importance of both definitions and internal stimuli for the construction of feelings. Finally, the manner in which role-taking emotions (feelings that presuppose role taking) facilitate social control is treated, using symbolic interactionist tenets. I conclude by arguing for the necessity of sociological investigations of emotion for a full understanding of both emotion and social life.

Consistent with other studies, the results, based on the 1980 5% Public Use Microdata Sample, show that Hispanic and nonwhite workers, compared with their white counterparts, lost earnings from residence and work in labor markets with a large share of monority residents and that this relationship was especially pronounced for black men. Further refinement of these results reveals additional differentation by educational groups: the earnings losses of black, Hispanic, and Asian men associated with residence in areas of high minority concentration are greatest among workers with college education and lowest among those who have not completed high school. That college-educated whites gained most from minority concentration emphasizes how both ascribed (race) and achieved (education) identifiers must coincide to generate white earnings advantages. Considered by themselves, neither racial nor educational divisions explain fully how earnings disparties are accentuated by the ethnic composition of labor markets.

For Cleveland the data indicate some clear declines in residential segregation since 1930 for "new" southern and eastern European ethnic group; "old" groups, however, actually increased in segregation. Between 1960 and 1970, we could find few changes in patterns of ethnic segregation for Boston, Cleveland, and Seattle. On the whole, we found that differences in residential segregation among ethnic groups, both cross-sectionally and over time, were highly related to differences in social status. It is clear, nevertheless, that ethnic segregation would continue to exist even if social status differences among ethnic groups disappeared.

This article investigates the sources and consequences of employed wives' perceptions of fairness in the division of housework. The findings support a social exchange explanation: women who have fewer alternatives to marriage and less economic resources are more likely to view a given division of housework as fair, while women with more alternatives view the same division as unjust. Also, women who perceive an unequal situation as unfair experience lower psychological well-being.

Lizotte	American Journal of Sociology	93	2	1987-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 383-405	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Recent investigations have explained regional differentials in homicide by reference to a reformulated subculture-of-violence thesis, which posits a southern subculture of violence. These studies heavily emphasize the role of firearms in violent subcultures. This paper develops a model that specifies the relationship between regions and subcultures of violence while determining the relationship of both to gun ownership. Analysis of patterns of gun ownership among individuals shows that the violent values indicative of sub-culture-of-violence membership are unrelated to region when structural factors are taken into account. Moreover, gun ownership is unrelated to the violent values indicative of subcultures of violence. Instead, both region and gun ownership are related to defensive attitudes that are not indicative of a subculture of violence. These results cast doubt on the validity of the reformulated subculture-of-violence thesis that emphasizes a regional subculture of violence with guns as a central feature. While interpersonal violence, such as homicide, may be a function of subcultures of violence, these subcultures operate independently of region and may be associated with, but are in no way dependent on, firearms.

Baron	American Journal of Sociology	91	4	1986-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 759-799	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article develops and tests hypotheses about the determinants of sex segregation in occupations employing both men and women, analyzing data on a diverse sample of California establishments. In the few instances in which men and women perform similar work roles, the jobs are typically done in distinct organizational settings, and when an enterprise employs both sexes in the same occupation, men and women are usually assigned different job titles. The findings are consistent with the theory of statistical discrimination, wich posits that employers reserve some jobs for men and others for women. However, little evidence is found that employers' practices reflect efficient and rational responses to sex differences in skills and turnover costs. Alternative explanations for gender segregation within and among organizations are suggested and the research necessary to develop a more accurate account of the sexual division of labor in the workplace is outlined.

The index, termed the modified distance based index (MDBI), is similar in structure to Jakubs's (1981) recently introduced distance-based index, but for purposes of standardization it employs a different definition of complete segregation. The MDBI is algebraically specified in terms of the index of dissimilarity and its properties are described. It is suggested that an unstandardized measure, termed the spatial dissimilarity index (SD), is useful to describe the development of segregation in a city. The utility of these indexes is demonstrated by charting the progress of segregation in Philadelphia between 1950 and 1970.

Reputations depend on the "embeddedness" of interactions in structures or networks of social relations. They illustrate the effects of such embeddedness on the outcomes of interactions.This article presents simple game-theoretic models of reputation effects on efficiency (in the Pareto sense) in interactions. In a comparative perspective, the authors start with a baseline model of a social system in which reputation effects (of a specific kind) are excluded: actors do not receive information on their partners' behavior in interactions with third parties. Such a system of "atomized interactions" is compared to a system with interactions that are "perfectly embedded": actors are immediately informed on all interactions of their partners with third parties.Efficiency is more easily attained as a result of individually rational behavior in perfectly embedded systems. In a final step, the comparative perspective is broadened, and the extreme assumptions of either an atomized or a perfectly embedded social system replaced. Intermediate cases arise in the consideration of "imperfect embededness," that is, a situation in which actors are informed only after some time lag on the behavior of their partners vis-a-vis third parties. It is shown that the conditions for efficiency become more restrictive as the information time lag lengthens.

This paper argues that the two are compatible and complementary. Structural role theory has come to regard inter-and intrarole conflict as the natural state of affairs; thus conformity to internalized norms has been undermined as an explanatory device and as the image of the actor's generic orientation to the normative order. In structural theory, systematic stability and patterned conduct are explained by structural mechanisms that ameliorate the adverse consequences of conflicting expectations. The question of how the actor copes with conflicting expectations is not addressed in middle-range structural theory, although it is implied as a conceptual problem. Interactionists, have addressed the negotiation of meaning in interaction as the actor's practical solution to the problems caused by conflicting social pressures. Negotiated meanings do not replace conflicting expectations, but coexist with them as a working consensus among actors concerning how conflicts are to be resolved in particular situations, despite their several preferences. The development of the working consensus and the symbolic representation of conflicting models of what ought to be the case are implications of the model of the pragmatic actor developed by George Herbert Mead.

Similar models for the black population posit continuing residential concentration combined with rapid turnover and succession. Our analysis of data on recent settlement patterns of Puerto Ricans in New York incates that this group is conforming the neither type of previously accepted model. Competition between te Puerto Rican minority and the larger, more economically advantaged black minority, a new set of public housing opportunities, and the return migration of successful Puerto Ricans are actors that were not considered in previously developed models. A new model of residential segregation and succession must incorporate these realites of contemporary urbanization.

In response to EEO legislation and case law, personnel managers devised and diffused employment practices that treat all classes of workers as ambitious and achievement oriented in the process of formalizing and rationalizing promotion decisions.

Two analyses are computed, based on similarities of intergenerational mobility inflows and of residential patterns. In both analyses the farm versus nonfarm distinction is the most basic. The second level divides occupations into middle- and working-class clusters. These clusters lend support to a hypothesis of proletarianization of white-collar work; embourgeoisement, manual-nonmanual, middle-mass, and knowledge-technocracy theories are not supported. In both analyses, the majority of clericals and, in the second analysis, technicians are more similar to manual workers than to middle-class occupations. An analysis of friendship choices lends further support to the location of clericals among the working class. The results also document the promise of cluster analysis as a major analytical tool far analyzing social structures.

Findings consistently show a significant reciprocal relationship between gun ownership levels and the homicide rate, with crime pushing up gun ownership and gun ownership in turn pushing up the homicide rate. Greater certainty of arrest and conviction for homicide has a significant negative effect on the homicide rate, suggesting a deterrent effect of legal sanctions, while the homicide rate in turn has a negative effect on the certainty of punishment. This is consistent with a hypothesis of the strain on cirminal justice system resources resulting from increasing crime. Further, the hypothesis that the imprisonment o criminal offenders has an incapacitative effect on homicide rates independent of deterrence effects is supported. Contrary to the recent findings of Ehrlich (1975b), the analysis fails to detect consistent evidence of a deterrent effect of capital punishment on U.S. homicide rates for 1947-73. This may be because of the infrequency of executions during this period.

The first section contains a critical account of some leading interpretations of the rise of modern sociology in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in Europe, concentrating primarily on Durkheim but refering also to Max Weber. I try to show that these interpretations, still very commonly held, have to be abandoned as myths. Like all myths, however, they contain a rational kernel, and in seeking to show what this might be, I indicate some lines of development which I consider to be important in sociology in the present day. Most characterizations of the current travails of social theory are concerned with issues of epistemology, that is, with problems of the sorts of "truth claims" that can be made in sociology. These matters, undeniably of pressing importance, are related to legacies from 19th-century social thought which we have to disavow. But there is another residue of the 19th century with which we have also to break: this is represented by what I cal the theory of industrial society. An essential task facing contemporary social theory is that of reconciling a revised epistemology of social science with new frameworks for the analysis of the development of advanced societies.

Ridge	American Journal of Sociology	101	1	1995-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 145-193	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article examines three themes about the relationships among class origin, education, and class destination in 10 industrial nations: (1) differential access to education for different class origins, (2) the allocation of class positions by education, and (3) the role of education in class reproduction and mobility. The patterns of association between class origin and education and between education and class destination are similar across the 10 nations. However, the strength of these associations shows cross-national variations. Class reproduction and mobility involve different social processes, which are differentially affected by education. However, a cross-national similarity emerges again in the way education mediates the association between class origin and destination. The conclusion presents some implications of this analysis for the study of comparative macrosociology.

This constitutive difficulty presents itself today in ways that have instructive parallels to the problem constellation confronting the first generation of 20th-century sociological classics. Karl Mannheim's Ideologie und Utopie (1929) was extraordinarily successful in Germany at the historical turning point of the Weimar Republic. This marks him as a representative figure among those contemporaries who acknowledged the force of "irrationalist" criticisms of progressive liberalism but sought to contain the destructive dynamics of such criticisms within a new type of rational framework, both intellectual and political. The article contrasts Mannheim's encounters with antirationalist thought in Ideologie un Utopie with the later pragmatist instrumental rationalism of his writings in English exile. In analyzing the shift, special attention is paid to Mannheim's involvement in Paul Tillich's religious socialist circle and to confrontations between Mannheim and Georg Lukacs, Oscar jaszi, Eduard Heimann, Max Hrkheimer, and Theodor W. Adorno. Newly discovered letters and transcripts are use to specify these relationships. Mannheim's promising theoretical beginnings were disruped by the brute facts of his generation's biography. Learning from Mannheim requires retrieval of his achievements, criticism of its distortions, and renewed start in the direction of his work during the 1920s.

Fischer	American Journal of Sociology	80	6	1975-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1319-1341	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Wirth's (1938) theory of urban life has been eclipsed in recent years by a perspective that denies the importance of ecological factors. This view, though more accurate than Wirth's, fails to account for the pervasive "unconventionality" (deviance, invention, etc.) of urban life. A model is presented here to remedy that problem; it reintroduces the variable of size but in a manner distinct from Writh's. Population concentration produces a diversityof subcultures, strengthens them, and fosters diffusion among them. Together, these three mediating variables account for urban unconventionality. The four propositions of the theory and three others deducible from it are examined against existing research.

Gould	American Journal of Sociology	99	6	1994-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1455-1491	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article shows that occupancy of brokerage positions in the U.S. health policy domain's communication network is a crucial determinant of influence. However, the ability to convert structural position into power is contingent on the type of brokerage position occupied and whether the actor is a government organization. In the government sector, actors in representative positions are more influential to the extent that they take public stands on events, whereas liaison and itinerant positions only confer influence if their occupants remain impartial. The article concludess that the influence of government organizations is contingent on their capacity to link disparate actors in the communication network while remaining uncommitted to specific policy agendas.

Particular attention is paid to the growth of services and their differentiation. The data are taken from 38 national censuses during the 1920-70 period. The results show three distinc patterns of the sectoral transformation of the labor force that can be identified with three regions: Western Europe, North America, and Japan. Furthermore, the internal reorganization of the service sector favored social and producer services which emerged as the most dynamic sectors of employment in all countries. Finally, the implications of this study for currently industrializing countries are discussed.

This study, however, focuses on the process whereby individual differences in age are transformed into age segregation; it does so through observation of the housing and location choices of individuals. A large sample of the population of all urbanized areas is used to test how persons of all ages fit into patterns of age segregation. In a path model, age is found related to neighborhood age structure, but its effects are considerable outweighed by those of housing and location choices. Elaboration of this general path model by age group shows that the individual model of age segregation operates least well among the elderly. Further exploration yields evidence that, among the elderly population, the traditional routes to age segregation have been replaced in recent years by an alternate process. It is suggested that the individual approach to age segregation would, if applied to other forms of segregation, advance knowledge of the phenomena.

Two incidents of mob violence in Cincinnati interrupted the discursive struggle over abolitionism, undermining some diagnoses and solutions while making others more compelling. Speakers incorporated the events into their discourses, thus creating new definitions of the situation and new means to resolve the problems it raised, abandoning or reworking discredited arguments, and reframing the issues in the debate. The conclusion discussed this study's implications for understanding the dialectical relationship between cultural representation and social action.

A straightforward extrapolation suggests that, other things being equal, a married person is least depressed if he or she completely dominates in the marriage. How ever, marriage is a close, long-term relationship in which the psychological benefits of personal control may be limited by a need for reciprocity and mutual control. In this article, an equity model of the relationship between depression and marital power is developed and tested, using data from a national, random sample of married couples. The results show that each spouse is least depressed if marital power is shared to some extent. There is a U-shaped relationship between depression and marital power. However, the husband's depression is lowest only if he has more marital power than is associated with his wife's lowest depression, and vice versa. The higher the husband's earnings, the greater the amount of his marital power that is associated with both his and his wife's lowest depression, and the more traditional a wife's sex-role beliefs, the greater the amount of her husband's marital power that is associated with her lowest depression. The division of marital power in the average marriage is closer to the level that minimizes the husband's depression than it is to level that minimizes his wife's depression.

Rule	American Journal of Sociology	84	1	1978-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 78-98	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Most sociologists predicate their work on the conviction that it will have at least some benefical social effects. But ideas vary greatly as to how such effects may come about. Perhaps the most difficult problem for proponents of any such "model of relevance" is to show how social insight can serve the general good when it addresses conflict situations in which help to one set of interests necessarily entails damage to others. Several different models of relevance are considered, as manifested in the writings of both classical and contemporary writers, including Sumner, Merton, Marx, Mills, and Barrington Moore, Jr. None of the formulations is found altogether satisfactory in resolving the problems inherent in building such models.

Miller McPherson	American Journal of Sociology	101	3	1995-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 698-720	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper aims to explain a major barrier to societal integration: the remarkable homogeneity of voluntary associations. The explanation derives from an ecological theory of voluntary affiliation that asserts that organizations compete for members in a property space defined by the sociodemographic characteristics of members. Voluntary organizations lose fastest those members who are either atypical of the group (the niche edge hypothesis) or subject to competition from other groups (the niche overlap hypotheis). The authors analyze an event-history data set, generated by the life-history calendar approach, of 2,813 voluntary association membership pells. The results, which strongly support both the niche edge and niche overlap hypotheses, substantiate the competitive ecological model of group structure.

The previous low proportion of women entering medicine could have resulted from sex-role socialization that influenced women not to aspire to careers in medicine and/or from direct discrimination by medical schools. Utilizing historical data on both application and admissions to medical school, this paper tests the specific hypothesis that medical school admissions committees discriminated against women: from 1929 to the present time, women applicants to medical school had just as good a chance of being accepted as men applicants. Also, the qualifications of the men and women applicants were essentially equal. These findings suggest that as far back as 1929 the low representation of women in medicine was primarily a result of differences in socializtion-based occupational choice. The paper does not deal with the important question of whether women had experienced discrimination either before application to medical school or after admission to it.

The Parent Survey of the High School and Beyond data set provides material for examining the traits of parents and children that shape parental payment for higher education. Parents' reported willingness and ability to pay, along with savings for children's future education, are shaped first by total income and the number of children who must share that income. Moreover, parental investment in higher education is increased when the parents themselves received parental financial support, which suggests continuity over generations. Gender of parent and child, academic achievement of child, marital status, education, and educational aspirations have more mixed and weaker effects. These findings cause a rethinking of the mechanisms of intergenerational influence as seen by status-attainment, human capital, and resource-dilution perspectives.

Two dimensions of black political empowerment are examined, absolute political power and relative political power. The analysis examines all U.S. central cities with a population of at least 50,000 residents, 10% of whom are black. Absolute black political power did not influence postneonatal mortality for blacks or whites. However, there is a negative association between relative balck political power and the black postneonatal mortality rate. Black political power had no significant effect on whithe postneonatal mortality. The implications of these findings for medical sociology theory are discussed.

The authors document distinct racial differences in family norms and the sanctions that supported those norms. Giving birth outside a marital relationship was clearly not the stigmatizing event for African-Americans that it was for whites. The authors also found that African-Americans were more likely than whites to end marriages under similar conditions. These results suggest that debates about contemporary racial differences need to take into account the historical background, both cultural and demographic, of diverse groups.

Self-employment declined in the United States almost steadily from the 19th century to the early 1970s. Since then, it has risen every year. Explaining this reversal in the historical fortunes of the petty bourgeoisie is the central task of this article. We reach four basic conclusions: first, the reversal in the decline of the self-employed is statistically significant and robust across a range of definitions of self-employment rates. Second, this reversal is not a simple countercyclical response to the increase in unemployment since the middle 1970s. Third, part of the resurgence of self-employment result from the expansion of various postindustrial services that tend to have higher levels of self-employment within them. Within postindustrial sectors, however, there has not generally been any increase in self-employment. Fourth, a significant part of the expansion of self-employment is explained by a increase in self-employment within most of the traditional sectors of the industrial economy.

The commentators who have addressed this theme have generally constricted its polymorphous character. This article inventories Weber's usage of "rationality" and "rationalization" in "Economy and Society" and the "Collected Essays in the Sociology of Religion." Four types of rationality are identified and compared with one another: practical, theoretical, substantive, and formal. Only "ethical substantive rationality" introduces methodical ways of life. All four types become manifest in a multiplicity of rationalization processes orchestrated at all levels of societal and civilization process. Long-term rationalization processes are seen to be rooted in values rather than in interests. The dominance of practical, theoretical, and formal rationalization processes in modern Western societies implies immense consequences for the type of person likely to live in these societies.

Data from 15 World Fertility Survey countries are used in a multilevel test of these hypotheses. The findings are that per capita GNP and family planning program effort affect not only country-specific average levels of CEB, but also the direction and magnitudes of the within country effects of two micro socioeconomic variables on CEB. These findings, which are largely consistent with the hypotheses, illustrate the utility of a multilevel approach.

Resource mobilization theories tend to underestimate workers' need for information. The fact that conditions are right for striking needs to be communicated through news of other strikes. Thus (a) strikes stimulate other strikes, net of objective bargaining conditions, (b) unionization increases the rate of strike imitation, (c) successful strikes generate more imitation than unsuccessful strikes, (d) unionization changes the locus of strike imitation from strike beginnings to endings, and (e) long average strike length changes the locus of imitation from endings to beginnings. These predictions are supported by evidence on Third Rupublic French coal mine strikes.

Both slavs and free blacks are found to have been lower preced sources of labor than whites, to whom they therefore posed a threat of displacement. Slavery was a system which gave souther capitalists total control of a cheap labor force, permitting extensive displacement. It also put the South in conflict with northern capital, because the latter depended on higher-priced (white) labor. Abolition threatened to increase competition between black and white labor, spreading the problem to all regions and segments of the economy. But anumission also made blacks more vulnerable to counterattacks by white labor in the form of either exclusion or the economy. But manumission also made blacks more vulnerable to conterattacks by white labor in the form of either exlusion or caste. The various class interests of the three parties to split labor markets are presented for the North, South, and West on the issues of abolition, the extension of slavery, and the position of free blacks. It is argued that an understanding of the interests of the white working class and its power to implement them is of major importance for untangling race relations before the Civil War.

Norr	American Journal of Sociology	82	4	1977-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 845-853	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Reanalysis of Udy's data for preindustrial societies shows that production techniques have a stronger direct influence that societal complexity on the structure of work organizations, including skill recruitment, specif goals, achievement, compensatory rewards, and ownership. The effects of societal complexity are equal to the effects of production techniques for only three bureaucratic elements: office rewards, hierarchy, and administrators. However, where workers maintain control of productive factors, even bureaucratic elements are mostly influenced by techniques. These results challenge Udy's thesis that complex peasant societies present more obstacles to the implementation of modern industrial work forms than do more primitive societies.

This paper counters such in a number of ways. Rival models of the effects of revolution are developed. To make testing of these competing models possible, revolution is conceived of as an experimental treatment in an interrupted time-series design. Utilizing this design, economic data on the Cuban Revolution are analyzed. The findings reject three leading models of revolutionary effects-the Conservative, the Marxist, and the Thermidorian. Instead, the results hint that the economic effects of revolution are neither as pervasive nor as disruptive as commonly supposed, at least in the short run.

Blum	American Journal of Sociology	91	3	1985-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 511-521	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Blau's macrostructural theory focuses on explanation of rates of social contacts between people with different social characteristics. The theory is composed of two analytically distinct categories of social structure. One category is distributional; that is, it refers to properties that emerger from size distributions of social characteristics. The other is a social network approach to social interactions. This article uses Fischer's data collected from 1,050 respondents living in 50 northern California localities to examine hypotheses derived from Blau's theory. The findings suggest that social structure constrains choice: ethnic and religious heterogeneity encourage interethnic and interreligious social interactions despite the negative effects of in-group preferences on such interactions.

This article uses data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to examine the extent to which three key factors-financial well-being, living arrangements, and marital history-account for this relationship. The authors model mortality using a flexible hazard model and find that both married men and women show substantially lower risks of dying than those who are not married. The study's results suggest that-for women but not for men-the improved financial well-being that often accompanies marriage accounts for much of its beneficial effect. For both husbands and wives the benefits from marriage appear to cumulate as the length of the union increases.

Bearman, Glenn Deane	American Journal of Sociology	98	1	1992-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 30-66	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Models that allow the decomposition of mobility into its structural and exchange components are used to identify the structure, and consequences, of middle-class intergenerational mobility in preindustrial (1548-1689) Norwich, England. Dramatic shifts in the mobility opportunities of sons over time are seen to yield distinct political outcomes. Political stability is associated with almost universal upward mobility in the period from 1548 to 1589, while from 1590 to 1639 structural processes leading to massive downward mobility are associated with increased radicalization and participation in the English civil war. From 1640 to 1689, strata persistence in an unstable political context prevailed.

The decline of the private house ensembles (Hauskapellen) resulted in a social broadening of music patronage and thereby tended to erode the traditional institutional means for aristocratic authority in musical affairs. The exclusive function that the qualitatively different ideology of "serious" music could provide reaffirmed traditional cultural boundaries through ideological rather than institutional means and enabled Vienna's old aristocrats to emerge after 1800 as the city's "most brilliant" dilettantes.

In its classical sense, it referred to the capacity of a social group to regulate itself. The concept supplied a basis for integration of theory and research until the 1930s. While the traditional usage of social control has persisted, the term has been redefined to mean either socialization or social repression. Either the classical meaning must be utilized or a new term must be developed to refer to the capacity of social groups to effect self-regulation if theory and research are to deal with macrosociology under advanced industrialism.

This paper argues that, is our present of foreseeable state of knowledge, such rank orderings are not empirically meaningful. When the comparison is based on efficiency (the ability to solve current problems) the insuperable difficulty is similar to that encountered in what economists call "interpersonal comparison of utility." When the criterion is flexibility in dealing with possible future problems, uncertainty of prediction in system environments is a crucial obstacle which, even in principle, cannot be overcome. Evidence is cited from nonlinear models in mathematical ecology to support this argument. It is claimed that this critique is related to but independent of previous arguments against developmental theories.

The argument here is that the condition for this spousal equality is the economic dependency of married women and that an examination of dependency is essential for understanding women's societal position. This paper examines changes in the extent to which married women were economically dependent on their husbands from 1940 to 1980. The finding is that the situation in 1980 is greatly different from the situation in 1940, when the vast majority of married women were completely dependent on spouses for economic support. Today, completely dependent wives constitute a distinct minority. Minority women have been less dependent than white women throughout this period. Married women become less dependent as they grow older, owing in part to the Social Security benefits that accrue to them regardless of work-force participation. A multivariate analysis pinpoints the source of most marital dependency as being the labor supply of married women. It also shows that married women must work longer hours than their husbands to contribute equally to family income.

Barrett, Martin King Whyte	American Journal of Sociology	87	5	1982-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1064-1089	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The Case of Taiwan represents a challenge to two predictions from dependency theory: that foreign economic penetration leads to slow economic growth and also to heightened inequality. Since the early 1950s Taiwan has received massive foreign aid and investment, but it has also had one of the highest sustained rates of growth in the world, while income inequality on the island has decreased substantially. An examinatin of this deviant case is pursued by consideration of the various mechanisms dependency theorists claim are responsible for the linkage of foreign economic penetration to stagnation and inequality. In the Taiwan case, none of these mechanisms work out as predicated. Instead, a variety of factors-including the nature of the Japanese colonial experience, the emphasis on labor-intensive enterprise, and the absence of an entrenched burgeoisie-created a situation in which both rapid growth and increasing equality could occur. Consideration of Taiwan draws attention to flaws in the arguments of most dependency theorists and suggests a more optimistic picture for at least some developing societies that have to deal with foreign economic penetration.

Goodman	American Journal of Sociology	87	3	1981-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 612-650	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article considers two kinds of criteria for determining whether certain rows in a two-way cross-classification table should be combined and/or whether certain columns in the table should be combined. These criteria pertain to homogeneity and structure. When these criteria are applied to the classic cross-classification on British occupational mobility recently studied by Duncan, Goodman, Hauser, and Clogg, new insights into these data are obtained. The application of these criteria in the present article also helps to clarify the meaning of the criteria considered here and related terms recently discussed by Breiger.

Pescosolido	American Journal of Sociology	97	4	1992-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1096-1138	The University of Chicago Press	fla		A classic problem common to sociology and other social sciences revolves around how people make decisions. Some recent approaches start with and revise an individually focused, rational action framework. While this orientation to building transdisciplinary, multilevel models provides many insights, it fails to capture essential features of social life. The social organization strategy (SOS) framework presented in this article offers a complementary approach to social action in general and decision making in particular. This orientation, a network and event-centered counterpart to rational choice, rests on fundamental principles that distinguish the discipline of sociology: social interaction is the basis of social life, and social networks provide the mechanism (interaction) through which individuals learn about, come to understand, and attempt to handle difficulties. This approach shifts the from individual "choice" to socially constructed patterns of decisions, including consultation with others. Utilization research in medical sociology serves as a case for reviewing theoretical approaches to decision making and provides the background necessary to a theoretical exposition of the SOS approach using data from the National Survey of Access to Medical Care (1975-76.) The results support the utility of pursuing the SOS framework.

This paper re-examines this proposal during three 10-year periods spanning 1940-70 using Shaw and McKay's own data as well as a more recent set of observations. Evidence is presented that their model is tenable only between 1940 and 1950; since 1950, changing neighborhoods tend to be characterized by changing levels of delinquency. Historical shifts in the nature of ecological processes that may account for this divergence are discussed.

Transition-to-work is emphasized because work structures people's lifestyles and is the major source of socioeconomic status; however, its nature is often unpredictable in early adulthood, while other personal attributes emerge early. The theory is applied to the dynamics of assortative mating under two contrasting scenarios: when gender roles are highly segregated, and when women's economic roles start to resemble those of men. Finally, the implications of the analysis for Becker's reduced-gains-to-marriage argument are assessed.

Eisenstadt	American Journal of Sociology	85	4	1980-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 840-869	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper analyzes the impact of cultural orientations on the patterns of change of some of the major types of "traditional" social and political systems. Offering a theoretical framework and analytical tools for the analysis of the relations between "ideas" or "culture" and social structure, the study is intended also to contribute to analysis of the relations between the dynamics of historical civilizations (defined usually in cultural or symbolic terms) and the dynamics of social and political systems. Last, it is intended to contribute to a reappraisal and reorientation of comparative studies in general and comparative-institutional ones in particular. The first of three sections distinguishes among three ideal-typic patterns of change in traditional civilizations: coalescent, partially coalescent, and noncoalescent. These are differentiated both according to the degree of change in major institutions, in the structure of power, and in the economic sphere, and according to the extent to which the actual processes of change tend to coalesce. The second section explores underlying causes of the variations in patterns of change. Particular attention is paid to cultural orientations, institutional structures, and the role of elites. The final section applies the analytic framework to selected traditional societies and civilizations exhibiting the three patterns of change. Social and cultural linkages are explored in three types of regime: imperial and imperial-feudal (the Chinese, Russian, and Byzantine Empires; Western European civilization), city-state and tribal federation (ancient Greece and certain Near Eastern societies), and patrimonial (Buddhist, Hindu, and Islamic civilizations).

Current maternal working conditions (i.e., a mother's working conditions at the time of the study) affect verbal facility, but paternal work hours in the early years have significant effects on children's behavior problems. Mother's current occupational complexity interacts with her resources and employment characteristics to influence both cognitive and social outcomes. The conclusion is that adequate parental resources contribute to the forms of family social capital useful in facilitating positive child outcomes, but that conclusions regarding negative effects of maternal work in the child's first year have been overgeneralized.

Edward Wells	American Journal of Sociology	83	3	1977-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 681-699	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper estimates arrest probabilities for marijuana users by combining detailed arrest statistic for three metropolitan areas (Cook County, Ill,; Douglas County (Omaha), Nebr., and the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area) with marijuana user rate estimates from questionnaire surveys in those three jurisdictions. The analysis involves a comparison of arrest probabilities for several sociodemographic categories of marijuana users in these jurisdictions. The baseline model for these comparisons is the equiprobability hypothesis that seems implicit in much criminal justice research: relative to violation rates, the likelihood of sanctions ought to be equal. The data show that arrest probabilities for marijuana users vary by gender and occupation in all three jurisdictions; variations by age and race are more jurisdictionally specific. These arrest probabilities are then examined by introducing additonal data pertaining to the circumstances of detection and arrest. The observed differences in arrest probabilities are interpreted to be compatible with two alternative explanations which have rather different implications for understanding selective law enforcement.

Kitagawa	American Journal of Sociology	90	4	1985-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 825-855	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Black teenagers living in metropolitan areas of the United States initiate sexual intercourse at earlier ages than other teenagers and have higher rates of premarital pregnancy. Ethnographic studies of black families have claimed that economic uncertainties cause young blacks to delay marriage, while many young women achieve adulthood through premarital parenthood. It is also probable that girls who grow up in a female-headed family or who see their sisters become teenage parents are more likely to accept single-parenthood as a way to achieve adult status. These studies have suggested that ghetto neighborhoods are characterized by loosely defined and enforced norms of sexual behavior and age and sex compositions conducive to juvenile deviance. These features of ghetto life make it difficult for parents to regulate successfully their children's behaviors. As a consequence, residents of ghetto neighborhoods are expected to initiate sexual intercourse at earlier ages and to have higher rates of accidental premarital pregnancy than other teens. These hypotheses have received limited support in previous demographic research on teenage fertility. In this paper, these ethnographic explanations of the fertility behaviors of black adolescents are tested, using data from a random sample of more than 1,000 black females aged 13-19 who lived in the city of Chicago in 1979. This analysis improves on previous demographic research by both measuring the total effects of these varibles on fertility and decomposing them into components due to effects on rates of initial sexual intercourse and the probability of conception among the sexually active. A nonbiasing, continuous-time semi-Markov model is used to identify the net effects of these factors on rates of initial sexual intercourse and pregnancy.

Jacobson	American Journal of Sociology	84	3	1978-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 698-705	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Two opposing theoretical arguments about the effect of court rulings on public attitudes are developed and tested using data collected before and after a desegregation ruling in Milwaukee. The social-adjustment argument is supported quite strongly. Parents of children in the public schools became more supportive of integration and busing on several different measures. On the other hand, people without children in the schools became more resistant, and parents of children in parochial schools showed the most negative attitude change. The proximity-resistance argument predicts that more resistance will occur in specific situations than in general situations and that most resistance will occur among those most affected by the decision. No support was found for this argument. The implications of the results are discussed briefly.

The approach postulates, first, that differences in the solidarity of any objectively defined groups are independently determined by the extent of stratification among these groups and interaction within them. These expectations are confirmed by an analysis of variation in the solidarity of 17 American ethnic groups in 1970. Second, the relative importance of class as against status group division in societies as a whole is held to depend upon the degree of hierarchy and segmentation of their respective cultural divisions of labor. Supportive evidence is found in the examination of differences in the strength of class voting among five Australian states in 1964.

Carlton	American Journal of Sociology	95	3	1989-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 723-753	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Measuring transactions as proportional variables rather than as marginal variables produces important differences in our images of economic networks. Market boundaries defined by proportional transactions emphasize the differences among specialized markets (production markets with a single principal supplier or consumer market). Boundaries defined by marginal transaction pattern with multiple supplier and consumer markets). The results reported here with marginal measures of transaction strength offer a substantively richer map of market boundaries than the result Burt reported with proportional measures. These findings promise to guide organizational research by offering clearer distinctions among the market environments in which organizations operate. Proportional transaction measures are well suited to their traditional use in economic input-output models tracing the flow of resources through a network. Marginal transactions are the more useful measure for sociological studies of market boundaries for organizational analysis, more clearly revealing variation in the resource-flow patterns that define structurally equivalent (substituable) production activities as a market.

The major findings are: (1) economic complexity and political complexity are both strongly related to monotheism; (2) each of them has some effect on monotheism that is independent of the effect of the other, the independent effect of economic complexity being stronger; and (3) a number of other variables are also related to monotheism, but these relationship are largely explained by economic and political complexity. The results are inconsistent with the theoretical perspective of Swanson and Durkheim in that the effects of the economy are not explained through the intervening mechanism of political organization. It is suggested that the results are consistent with Marx and Engels's theory of religion. In this view a high god is a reflection of existing economic and social relationships, presiding, at the ultimate level, over economic and political complexities.

Some scholars argue that economic dependency comples wives to exchange unpaid labor for a share of the husband's income. Others claim that wives perform housework-and husbands avoid it-to enact symbolically their femininity or masculinity. This article examines both perspectives and finds that among wives the link between housework and the transfer of earnings in marriage complies with rules of economic exchange. However, the more a husband relies on his wife for economic support, the less housework he does. It appears that by doing less housework, economically dependent husbands also "dogender."

Molm	American Journal of Sociology	91	6	1986-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1356-1386	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Although various theories have been advanced to explain sex differences in the use of power, few empirical studies have examined how men and women actually use power under conditions of structural power imbalance. This study compares prediction from three theoretical perspectives-socialization, structural, and expectation states-in a laboratory experiment on power. Males and females were assigned to the high or low position of structural power/dependency in power-imbalanced dyads, with a partner of the same or opposite sex and with power assignments based on competence (legitimation) or chance. The results indicate that the sex of the more powerful person did not affects power use. Overall power use was affected primarily by the sex of the less powerful person;it was greater when that dyad member was male. The process of power use (wether behavioral influence was ever attempted, and, if so, what patterns of influence were used) was examined to help explain these findings. This analysis revealed effects of legitimation on the dyads with powerful females and helped to explain the effects of the weaker person's sex on power use. Instead of providing unequivocal support for any one of the three theories, the results suggest that structure, socialization, and status expectations are complexly interrelated in their effects on power use.

This research can make further substantial contributions only if it becomes integrated into a more adequate theoretical framework. In the first part of the paper, elements of such a framework are developed. Social stratification is conceived of as a process of differential association emerging as a complement to that of class formation in order to develop and preserve collective social identity within a world characterized by pervasive economic inequality. The outcome of this process is a long-term macrosocial reproduction of inequality when it penetrates two strategic forms of social relations, parent-child and husband-wife relationships. The second part of the paper applies this theoretical approach to the marital relationship by discussing traditional and alternative hypotheses about stratification mechanisms within the decision to marry, patterns of marital homogamy, and consequences of marital heterogamy. The new framework avoids some problematic assumptions of the dominant tradition of research and is able to provide a more adequate explanation for many empirical findings.

Stephen Cole	American Journal of Sociology	89	1	1983-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 111-139	The University of Chicago Press	fla		For 200 years it has been assumed that the sciences are arranged in a hierarchy, with developed natural sciences like physics at the top and social sciences like sociology at the bottom. Sciences at the top of the hierarchy presumably display higher levels of consensus and more rapid rates of advancement than those at the bottom. A distinction is made between two classes of knowledge: the core, or fully evaluated and universally accepted ideas which serve as the starting points for graduate education, and the research frontier, or all research currently being conducted. Data are presented from a set of empirical studies which show that, at the top and at the bottom of the hierarchy in either cognitive consensus or the rate at which new ideas are incorporated. It is concluded that in all sciences knowledge at the research frontier is a loosely woven web characterized by substantial levels of disagreement and difficulty in determining which contributions will turn out to be significant. Even at the research frontier, however, minimal levels of consensus are a necessary condition for the accumulation of knowledge. Consensus in all sciences is maintained by sociological processes such as the evaluation and reward systems.

Recently, though, a literature has arisen which criticizes the dissimilarity index and proposes revisions or alternative statistics. Here a statistic is derived that explicitly incorporates the spatial relationships among the geographic parcels into the tabulation, a feature absent from the dissimilarity index and its competitors. This proximity statistic is compared with other indices and is found to be somewhat successful in distinguishing between single-cluster and multiple-cluster residential settlement patterns.

The findings demonstrate that the effects of legal variables are important determinants of sentencing irrespective of the organizational context whereas the effects of plea are conditioned by the level of bureaucratization in courts. The results also suggest that racial effects on sentencing are curtailed in the context of sentencing guidelines.

The findings provide a basis for modifying and extending Peter Blau's analysis of the relationship between university social structure and the pattern of communication among university faculty. Blau regards the formation of integrative multidisciplinary social networks within university communities as highly problematic; he suggests that academic departments are the primary site of integrative social networks within universities. My findings suggest that academic departments are not appropriate units for describing the pattern of research communication among university faculty, at least in the physical sciences, and that university social structure can foster an integrative social network which is multidisciplinary in composition. Proposals are introduced that relate facets of university social structure to the formation of integrative multidisciplinary social networks. A perspective on the role of universities in fostering the coherence of the scientific elite is outlined.

This article proposes that ghettos are communities that have experienced epidemics of social problems. One important implication of this theory is that the pattern of neighborhood effects on social problems should be nonlinear in large cities. As neighborhood quality decreases, there should be a sharp increase in the probability that an individual will develop a social problem. The jump should occur somewhere near the bottom of the distribution of neighborhood quality. This hypothesis is tested by analyzing the pattern of neighborhood effects on dropping out and teenage childbearing. The analysis strongly supports the hypothesis, with exceptions for certain subgroups. Even after controlling for individual characteristics, black and white adolescents are exposed to sharp increases in the risk of dropping out and having a child in the worst neighborhoods in large cities.

Mead's concern about the perpetuation of a "permanent class of criminals" is discussed, and special attention is given to an intergenerational interaction effect of parent and son labeling on subsequent delinquent and criminal behavior. This intergenerational interaction effect is explored, net of the acknowledged role of cultural/characterological influences, which are modeled in several ways using data collected in a well-known London panel study. The article addresses implications of the neglect of labeling effects in contemporary longitudinal research initiatives directed to the formation of crime policy.

Feld	American Journal of Sociology	86	5	1981-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1015-1035	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Sociologists since Simmel have been interseted in social circles as essential features of friendship networks. Although network analysis has been increasingly used to uncover patterns among social relationships, theoretical explanations of these patterns have been inadequate. This paper presents a theory of the social organization of friendship ties. The approach is based upon Homans's concepts of activities, interactions, and sentiments and upon the concept of extra-network foci organizing social activities and interaction. The theory is contrasted with Heider's balance theory. Implications for transitivity, network bridges, and density of personal networks are discussed and presented as propositions. The focus theory is whosn to help explain patterns of friendships in the 1965-66 Detroit Area Study. This paper is intended as a step toward the development of integrated theory to explain interrelationships between networks and other aspects of social structure. Inplications for data analysis are discussed.

The latter figures dropped to 10% or less when the DK alternative was provided as part of the question. Contrary to findings concerning most issues, more educated persons showed greater willingness to admit ignorance in these cases involving an unknown object. For those persons who did express opinions, more than mere guessing seemed to be involved: respondents appeared to interpret the wording of the question in a way that had meaning for them, and then to express a more general attitude toward that constructed object.

Byron Groves	American Journal of Sociology	94	4	1989-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 774-802	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Shaw and McKay's influential theory of community social disorganization has never been directly tested. To address this, a community-level theory that builds on Shaw and McKay's original model is formulated and tested. The general hypothesis is that low economic status, ethnic heterogeneity, residential mobility, and family disruption lead to community social disorganization, which, in turn, increases crime and delinquency rates. A community's level of social organization is measured in terms of local friendship networks, control of street-corner teenage peer groups, and prevalence of organizational participation. The model is first tested by analyzing data for 238 localities in Great Britain constructed from a 1982 national survey of 10,905 residents. The model is then replicated on an independent national sample of 11,030 residents of 300 British localities in 1984. Results from both surveys support the theory and show that between-community variations in social disorganization transmit much of the effect of community structural characteristics on rates of both criminal victimization and criminal offending.

Kandel	American Journal of Sociology	87	2	1981-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 363-387	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The specific influence of parents and peers on adolescents' educational aspirations is examined in a relational sample of matched adolescent-parent-best friend triads (N=762). A nonrecursive model of peer influence is also estimated. Most previous estimates of interpersonal influences are based on the adolescent's perceptions of the significant other's attitudes or behaviors rather than on the significant other's self-reports of these attributes. Estimates of interpersonal influences based upon self-reported attributes are presented. It is shown that perceptual measures inflate estimates of interpersonal influence. Independent data from parents document that perceptual measures of significant others' attributes reflect not only attributes of the person being perceived but also attributes of the perceiver. Parental influence on the adolescent's aspirations is stronger than peer influence, and this influence does not decline over the adolescent years. Peers are involved in a process of reciprocal influence, and peer influences are stronger among girls than among boys.

Both science and a certain nonprofessional element of the services are inferred to contain a germ of the ideal-an "anti-Weberian" (but at the same time "non-Durkheimian") pattern of stable and efficient societal organization of work. Significantly, the pattern is a self-sustaining one. It rules out certain social forces, such as societal ideologies, which are foreign to the nature of a particular activity; this trait distinguishes it from the "classical" medieval pattern. It also rules out direct coercion of the worker. The dual paradigm of the social system propounded here for theoretical ends may also provide a promising tool for analysis of various sociocultural phenomena.

Unfortunately, most research ignores the possibility that violent-crime rates may affect racial composition. Using a sample of U. S. cities, the authors examine the reciprocal effects of racial composition and violent-crime rates over the last 40 years. While racial composition strongly affects the change in violent-crime rates from 1980 to 1990, it only minimally affects changes in rates for the previous three decades; but violent-crime rates (especially robbery) substantially affect the change in racial composition for all four decades. Indeed, robbery rates appear to play a significant role in the white flight from central cities.

The authors modify Heckathorn's formal model of collective action to derive predictions concerning the possibility of interracial solidarity or strikebreaking given split labor market conditions. Predictions are then examined using qualitative comparative analysis for 16 northern cities that participated in the 1919 steel strike. Results show that interracial solidarity developed in cities that had strong local union organizations and nonrepressive governments, while black strikebreaking emerged in cities with higher proportions of recent black migrants and either repressive local governments or weak unions.

"Skewed" groups contain a large preponderance of one type (the numerical "dominants") over another (the rare "tokens"). A framework is developed for conceptualizing the processes that occur between dominants and tokens. Three perceptual phenomena are associated with tokens: visibility (tokens capture a disproportionate awareness share), polarization (differences between tokens and dominants are exaggerated), and assimilation (tokens' attributes are distorted to fit preexisting generalizations about their social type). Visibility generates performance pressures; polarization leads dominants to heighten their group boundaries; and assimilation leads to the tokens' role entrapment. Illustrations are drawn from a field study in a large industrial corporation. Concepts are extended to tokens of all kinds, and research issues are identified.

Few actual political processes conform to such models. Revolutions provide an important example of such reasoning and of its pitfalls. Better models rest on plausible ontologies, specify fields of variation for the phenomena in question, reconstruct causal sequences, and concentrate explanation on links within those sequences.

The integration is carried out within the mathematical framework of status characteristics theory, and the mathematical formulation that is an integral part of that theory is extended. The formulation makes it possible to explain and describe the power and prestige order where actors are discriminated by status characteristics and at the same time are communicating evaluations of each others' performances. Based on the theory a specific model is constructed to predict stay response rates in the Webster-Sobieszek experimental situation. The authors demonstrate that the model fits the available data well.

Don Sherman Grant II, Michael Wallace	American Journal of Sociology	96	5	1991-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1117-1150	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Past research on violence in collective movements using the resource-mobilization perspective has focused almost exclusively on the instrumental role violence plays for "outsider" groups seeking political recognition. Little is known about the causes of violence among groups such as labor unions that are at least marginally incorporated into the polity. There have been no empirical studies of the determinants of strike violence in advanced countries during the post-World War II period when workers' interests have become "institutionalized." This article uses strike-level data from Ontario from 1958 to 1967 to examine the causes of strike violence. Strike violence is related to features of the sociopolitical context within which strikes occur, the legislative environment, the skill mix of striking workers, and of great importance, the strategies utilized by striking workers and the counterstrategies used by employers. In sum, violence is shown to be employed as a defensive measure after challenger groups have gained access to the polity.

This study concludes that an intermediate layer of leadership is critical to the micromobilization of a social movement. This intermediate layer provides a bridge (1) between the social movement organization(s) and potential adherents and constituents, (2) between prefigurative and strategic politics, and (3) between potential leaders and those already predisposed to movement activity. The latter illustrates that mobilization does not always occur in a linear fashion (i.e., formal leaders mobilize and recruit participants). In the case of the civil rights movement, this intermediate layer of leadership was the primary area for women's leadership.

Kohn, Carmi Schooler	American Journal of Sociology	87	6	1982-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1257-1286	The University of Chicago Press	fla		In earlier work, we assessed a longitudinal causal model of the reciprocal effects of the substative complexity of work and intellectual flexibility. In this paper, we greatly expand the causal model to consider sumultaneously several structural imperatives of the job and three major dimensions of personality-ideational flexibility, a self directed orientation to self and society, and a sense of distress. The analysis demonstrates that the structural imperatives of the job affect personality. Self-directed work leads to ideational flexibility and to a self-directed orientation to self and society; oppressive working conditions lead to distress. These findings strongly support a learning generalization model. Personality, in turn, has important consequences for an individual's place in the job structure and in the system of social stratification. In particular, both ideational flexibility and a self-directed orientation lead, over time, to more responsible jobs that allow greater latitude for occupational self-direction.

Specifically, we investigate the extent to which extended living arrangements help buffer the effect of labor market disadvantages faced by minority household heads. Results of logit and regression analyses indicate that differences in the prevalence of extented family households reflect primarily group-specific differences in the propensity to extend, but that this demographic mechanism may also serve as a compensatory strategy for supplementing the temporarily or chronically low earnings of minority household heads. In black and Hispanic households, nonnuclear members contribute significantly to total household income, although their relative contributions are approximately similar for poor and nonpoor households. Nonnuclear members in non-Hispanic white households appear not to participate significantly in the generation of household income.

Of three contextual variables, internal dependence is found to be the most powerful predictor of bureaucratic control; organizational size and technological authomaticity show their influence on control by channeling through some intervening variables. The finding that structural differentiation has no important associations with centralization and formalization disconfirms part of our proposition, but each of the other two complexity variables (functioanl specialization and knowledge complexity)is a significant predictor of one of the two control variables. The magnitude of predictor of variance explained by all the variables examined suggests that the model used is more predictive of formalization than of centralization.

This follows from their different bases for prestige assignment. Intraprofessional status rests on the exclusion of nonprofessional issues or of professional issues irrelevant in a particular case. Public status for professionals rests on effective contact with disorder or nonorder. In the pursuit of intraprofessional status, professions and professionals thus tend to withdraw from precisely those problems for which the public gives them status. This phenomenon of professional regression partly accounts for many otherwise incomprehensible aspects of professional life, such as the prominence of inappropriate training, the rapid dispersal of esoteric professional knowledge to the public, and the lack of systematic approaches to such important problems as death.

The effects of origins are due to greater openness to environmental pressures at the time of formation than later on.

This review of recent panel analyses assessing the various theoretical viewpoints shows consistent support for only one of the posited relationships-that delinquent activity reduces subsequent self-esteem-and the support is rather weak. The paper evaluates the dynamics of the self-esteem-delinquent activity reduces subsequent self-esteem-and the support is rather weak.

The results show that the effect of self-esteem on subsequent self-esteem. These findings are robust across various subgroups of age, gender, family type, race, and mother's education. They are also consistent across the various measures of self-esteem and delinquent behavior.

This argument has been confused with his sociology of knowledge, and Durkheim's overall position has been misunderstood as a consequence. The current popularity of a "cultural" or "ideological" interpretation of Durkheim is as much a misunderstanding of his position as the "functional" interpretation from which the current interpretations seek to rescue him. Durkheim articulated a sophisticated epistemology in the classical sense, a point that has been entirely missed.

Gamson, Andre Modigliani	American Journal of Sociology	95	1	1989-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1-37	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Media discourse and public opinion are treated as two parallel systems of constructing meaning. This paper explores their relationship by analyzing the discourse on nuclear power in four general audience media: television news coverage, newsmagazine accounts, editorial cartoons, and syndicated opinion columns. The analysis traces the careers of different interpretive packages on nuclear power from 1945 to the present. This media discourse, it is argued, is an essential context for understanding the formation of public opinion on nuclear power. More specifically, it helps to account for such survey results as the decline in support for nuclear power before Three Mile Island, a rebound after a burst of media publicity has died out, the gap between general support for nuclear power and support for a plant in one's own community, and the changed relationship of age to support for nuclear power from 1950 to the present.

The pattern of state theatrical subsidy within fascist Italy challenges the assumption that narrative content is the principal vehicle of meaning. By shifting the unit of analysis from the text of plays to discourses about theatrical production, a rhetoric of appropriation and reappropriation emerges between regime bureaucrats and cultural entrepreneurs that suggest that theatrical form, and not theatrical content, contained fascist meaning. This finding is extended to posit that the divorce between form and content that characterized the fascist theater also distinguished fascism from liberal democracy.

Comparisons of this kind are of interest whenever two explanations of a given phenomenon are specified as linear models. In this case, researchers should ask whether the coefficients associated with a given set of predictors change in a significant way when other predictors or covariates are added as controls. Simple calculations based on quantities provided by routines for regression analysis can be used to obtain the standard errors and other statistics that are required. Results are also given for the class of generalized linear models (e.g., logistic regression, log-linear models, etc.). We recommend fundamental change in strategies for model comparison in social research as well as modifications in the presentation of results from regression or regression-type models.

This paper discusses the guardians of impersonal trust and discovers that, in the quest for agent fidelity, they create new problems. The resulting collection of procedural norms, structural constraints, entry restrictions, policing mechanisms, social-control specialists, and insurance-like arrangements increases the opportunities for abuse while it encourages less acceptable trustee performance. Moreover, this system sometimes leads people to throw good "money" after bad; they protect trust and respond to its failures by conferring even more trust. The paper explores the sources and consequences of the paradox that the guardians of trust are themselves trustees.

This paper calls attention to a serious mistake in Phillips's data which invalidates his results. In addition, the paper describes a more precise approach which produces no evidence linking soap opera suicide stories to subsequent real-life fatalities. The error in Phillips's paper stems from the fact that he used newspaper summaries as sources for the soap opera suicide stories and, in eight out of 13 cases, misspecified the date of the event.

Japanese relative mibility rates show no systematically greater deviation from the postulated common pattern than do those of nine European nations. Regarding absolute mobility rates, however,an argument can be made for the distinctiveness of mobility patterns and processes of class formation and reproduction in Japan.

Although it has long been alleged that urban life is more stressful than that experienced in rural districts, the available evidence is far from consistent. This study, employing stress-alleviative drug use as an operational index of stress, examines rates of prescriptions for such drugs across the rural-urban continuum in New Zealand. The data, obtained from a nationwide surveys of pharmacists, are contrary to much of our convenitional wisdom regarding urban stress. Our findings indicate that in fact stress-related disorders are much more prevalent among rural than urban residents.

Sobel	American Journal of Sociology	85	2	1979-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 385-416	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Previous research on the social and psychological effects of mobility is limited in two crucial respects: virtually all analyses have been couched at the level of societal stratification systems and based exclusively on a single statistical design-the so-called square-additive model. This paper joins questions of structural context and statistical design in an analysis of the effects of mobility in the stratification system of the workplace. The square-and diamond-additive models are used to test hypotheses about the effect of organizational mobility on the commitment and the beliefs about opportunity of male managers of a large company. As with its application in the societal context, the square model indicates that mobility has no systematic and special effect on managerial orientation. The diamond model detects significant nonlinear effects of extent of movement on both dimensions of orientation but is limited in ways that hinder interpretation. To deal with the problems of these models a third model is developed-the workplace triangle. This model fits better than the others, shows significant mobility effects, and is interpretable. Differences between movers and stayers conform to certain a priori hypotheses, while differences among movers fit the predictions of equity theory.

In a relatively rigorous way, the authors infer how seemingly idiosyncratic expressions of tastes in names are in general affected by underlying cultural themes. For example, the results suggest that long-standing stereotyped role assignments still have a subtle but major effect on the naming process. Two major parental characteristics-education and race-modify these general patterns. In turn, taste differences in subpopulations reveal their general esthetics dispositions. The authors present these results as the first large-scale systematic comparison of educational differences in naming patterns in the United States.

Stephens	American Journal of Sociology	94	5	1989-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1019-1077	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Barrington Moore's Social Origins of Dictatorship and Democracy is widely regarded as a contemporary classic, yet there have been few attempts to evaluate the validity of his argument on a large number of comparable cases. This article makes such an attempt with all Western European countries experiencing democratic rule between 1870 and 1939. It seeks (1) to explain what structural and historical features distinguish the breakdown cases from those that remained democratic, and (2) to trace the process of class coalition formation in the transition to democracy and the subsequent breakdown. Moore's thesis does fit, with some modification. All four breakdwn cases were characterized historically by an authoritarian coalition of labor-repressive landlords, the state, and the bourgeoisie that contributed to the breakdown of democratic rule in the 1920s and 1930s. In contrast, in none of the democratic survivors did such a coalition materialize. This difference can be traced largely to the strenght of the agrarian elite in the late 19th century. However, in contrast to Moore's characterization of the conservative authoritarian path, the ruling coalition, except in Germany, did not play a modernizing role, and only in Austria can the bourgeoisie be described as a "dependent" partner in the coalition. Moreover, because it stops too early, Moore's analysis greatly underplays the role of the organized working class in the transition to democracy and attributes far too positive a role to the bourgeoisie.

Wive's thoughts of divorce increase with their work experience, having a youngest child aged 6-11, and egalitarian housework attitudes and decrease with age at marriage,marital duration, and husband's housework contribution.Husbands' thoughts of divorce increase with wife's work experience and wife's egalitarian housework attitudes and decrease with the presence of children under 6,marital duration, and age differences. To the extent that thought of divorce relates to eventual divorce, these findings imply that the husband's earnings and the presence of children may deter divorce less now than they have in the past.

Most microlevel data demonstrate such fertility differentials, but population IQ levels have risen rather than fallen. In this article, a simple two-sex model shows that negative fertility differentials are consistent with falling, rising, or constant IQ distributions. Under a wide variety of conditions, a constant pattern of fertility differentials will produce an unchanging, equilibrium distribution of IQ scores in the population. What matters for IQ trends is how the IQ distribution in one generation relates to the equilibrium distribution implied by that generation's fertility differentials. Intuition fails in this important area because it does not account for the macro structure within which micro results must be interpreted.

First, the analysis demonstrates that participation is positively related to economic development and divorce rate and negatively related to fertility and income inequality. While the effect of economic development is mediated by various aspects of familial composition, the most significant effect on female labor force participation is that of income inequality. In societies where inequality is high, women are less likely to join the labor force. The analysis goes on to demonstrate that female labor force participation has consequences for occupational discrimination. The odds that women can achieve high status and well-paid occupations decrease with the proportion of women in the labor force. The findings reported here suggest strongly that the integration of females into the labor force is determined by the shape of the stratification system. Such integration, however, results in occupational discrimination. The meaning and significance of the findings are discussed in the light of sociological theories.

The authors find evidence that old and small institutions are more likely to fail, while young and small organizations have the highest growth rates.

The first, commonly associated with "postindustrial theory," sees work as becoming more humanized, more autonomous, less routinized; the second image, associated with Marxist theories of proletarianization, sees work as becoming more routinized and degraded, with less autonomy and responsibility for the worker. The debate between these two perspectives has largely been waged at the theoretical level, with at best anecdotal evidence in support of one side or the other. This study uses national data to make a preliminary assessment of the adequacy of each perspective. The central analytical strategy is to decompose total changes in the degree of proletarianization into two components: an industry-shift effect, which measures the changes in proletarianization due to changes in the overall sectoral distribution of the labor force across industries; and a class-composition-shift effect, which measures the changes in proletarianization due to changes within given sectors. Contrary to the expectations of postindustrial theory, it is demonstrated that there is a strong and consistent proletarianization process within sectors. This proletarianization process is hidden from view because of the strength of a counteracting process in the industry-shift effect (i.e., the relatively more rapid expansion of those sectors which were relatively less proletarianized in the first place). The paper concludes with a discussion of the likely transformation of the class structure in the remaining part of the century. It is predicted that this counteracting tendency will weaken, and thus a clearer process of aggregate proletarianization should appear in the next decades.

They suggest that persons living in crowded apartments with little option of moving elsewhere will tend to reduce fertility. Quasi-experimental data from a Colombian public housing project indicate that apartment living significantly reduced fertility among lower-middle- and upper-working-class persons living in a tight housing market. These findings are potentially important in evaluating long-run consequences of housing policies on population growth.

The global context of urban growth is accented in this analysis.

LaFree	American Journal of Sociology	88	2	1982-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 311-328	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Previous research in criminology assumes that rape is primarily an intraracial phenomenon. But empirical studies since the late 1950s have shown substantially higher rates of black offender-white victim (BW) than white offender-black victim rape. The present study tested two models of BW rape on a set of 443 rape victimizations collected by the National Crime Panel from 1973 to 1977. The normative model interprets BW rape as a correlate of increased social interaction between black men and white women. The conflict model interprets BW rape as a correlate of increased black politicalization. The results did not support the normative model and only partially supported the conflict model. Discriminant analysis showed that the characteristics of victims were unrelated to BW rapes and the BW rapes were less likely than other rapes to follow legitimate social interaction between the victim and offender. By contrast, BW rapes were no more violent than black or white intraracial rapes. Implications for a sexual stratification theory of interracial rape are discussed.

Mizruchi	American Journal of Sociology	95	2	1989-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 401-424	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Political sociologists have debated for decades, without resolution, whether elites in advanced capitalists societies are integrated. Rather than ask whether elites are integrated, this study examines the conditions under which convergence of political behavior occurs, focusing on campaign contributions of political action committees in the American business community. A model of similarity in corporate political behavior is proposed that draws on principles developed by resource-dependence and social class theorists of intercorporate relations. The model was supported by an examination of the 1,596 dyads created by relations among 57 large U.S. manufacturing firms in 1980. Membership in the same primary industry or several similar industries, geographical proximity of headquarters locations (but not plant locations), market constraint, and common relations with financial institutions (through either stock ownership or directorate ties) were positively associated with the similarity of political behavior between firms. Market constraint affected the similarity of political behavior primarily because it increased the likelihood that firms would produce in the same industries. The effect of indirect board interlocking throung financial institutions was a stronger predictor of similarity of political behavior than was direct interlocking between manufacturing firms. The findings suggest the simultaneous importance of organizational and social network factors in understanding common political behavior between firms.

High scores of racial intolerance among certain ethnic groups appear to be strongly associated with that group's employment situation. Generally, the data confirm the idea that ethnic groups which directly compete with blacks for employment opportunities in secondary labor markets are more racially intolerant than ethic groups employed in primary labor markets. Racial tolerance and intolerance among white groups are explained as social psychological products of labor market conditions.

Mortensen	American Journal of Sociology	94		1988-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. S215-S240	The University of Chicago Press	fla		How do job-worker and husband-wife relationships form, and why do some matched pairs subsequently separate? Economists and game theorists are in the process of developing and applying an equilibrium explanation of match formation and separation based on the principle of voluntary pairing under competitive conditions. The purpose of this paper is to assess the current state of these developments. The general existence of patnership structures with the property that no one has an incentive to separate has been established. These equilibrium structures maximize aggregate "value" over the set of all feasible match structures in the transferable utility case. According to this pure theory of matching, competition for partners can be expected to yield equilibrium match structures that are both stable and socially efficient, at least under conditions of frictionless certainty. Search-theoretic models that take account of meeting costs and initial uncertainty about match values have been developed to explain separation behavior as a process of shopping for a "good match." These models suggest several possible social inefficiencies in the match formation and separation processes. Finally, labor economists have recently provided empirical evidence that supports this view of the process.

This paper focuses on the legislative struggle between child insurers and child savers who opposed the insuring of children. I whos that although monetary compensation for the death of a child was initially justified by the pecuniary loss for the parents, the final success of the insurance industry was based on more than economic rationality. It made its appeal primarily as burial insurance for poor children. This is a measure of the emerging "sacralization" of children's lives.

In contrast with the more commonly used textbookish political knowledge indices, this measure corresponds more closely to knowledge-in-use. Conceptual integration is defined as the spontaneous and explicit organization of ideas and information in terms of abstract or ideological constructs and represents an expansion of Philip Converse's research on levels of ideological thinking in mass publics. These two related dimensions of political information processing emerge from a detailed content analysis of depth interview transcripts. The analysis reveals substantial variation in the way citizens relate the condition of their own lives to those of their fellow citizens and to political authorities. As expected, education plays a central role in explaning these patterns, but there are some surprising interactive linkages between education and patterns of political thought. One specially intriguing finding is that conservatives have significantly lower scores than liberals on indices of differentiation and integration. The ramifications of these findings for survey research methodology and theories of mass political behavior are discussed.

Organizations respond initially by elaborating their formal structures to create visible symbols of compliance. As organizations construct and institutionalize forms of compliance with laws, they mediate the impact of those laws on society. The author uses data from a nationwide survey of 346 organizations to develop models of the creation and institutionalization of organizationally constructed symbols of compliance following the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

Analysis of underdevelopment in extractive export economies requires time-lagged models of the cumulative effects of the sequence of local modes of extraction organized in response to world-system demands. Such a model, organized aroud the predominance of specific commodities at different times, is derived from a critical synthesis of various theories of development and underdevelopment. The propositions in this model are examined through a case study of the sequence of extractive export economies in the Amazon Basin from the time of colonial conquest to the present.

Poston, Jr., Toni Falbo	American Journal of Sociology	96	2	1990-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 433-451	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This study was undertaken to determine whether the academic and personality outcomes of only children in China are similar to those of only children in the West. Several reviews of the extensive Western literature indicate that only children are remarkably similar to children with siblings. The few differences between them are concentrated in academic areas, where only children have the advantage. In China few children grew up without siblings until 1979, when to one-child policy was initiated. Since then, over 90% of newly formed families in the large urban areas have only one child. The incidence of one-child families in the rural areas is much smaller. The results of our 1987 survey of 1,460 schoolchildren and their parents and teachers, in the urban and rural areas of Changchun, a large industrial city in Jilin Province in northeastern China, contain many findings similar to those of surveys in the West, with one exception. Among urban children, those without siblings have higher academic scores than those with siblings, but these advantages are not found among rural children. Moreover, when only children are compared to firstborns, no differences are found once appropriate background controls are introduced. Also consistent with Western results, only children do not appear to differ from children with siblings in terms of two personality dimensions representing childhood adjustment in China, as judged by both their mothers and teachers.

They argued that, in a period of economic stagnation such as occurred in the 1970s, there should be an acceleration of the process of proletarianization and a decline in the expansion of managerial and semiautonomous employee (or expert) locations in the class structure. These changes should occur both because of an intensification of proletarianization within economic sectors and because of decline in the shift of employment into the relatively less proletarianized sectors such as the state. On the basis of the data used in this study, none of these predictions is supported. Indeed, the evidence indicates a decisive acceleration of the growth of managerial class locations in the 1970s and a clear deproletarianization within and across economic sectors. These findings are interpreted as a result of two principal factors: the internationalization of American class relations during the 1970s and the effect of technological and organizational changes in production on clases in the United States.

Study of approximately 10,000 first admissions to state hospitals in one state covering the period 1956-65 shows an inverse relationship only for organic and schizophrenic disorders. In light of the etiological and predisposing factors that are involved in these two disorders, physical and medical factors appear to be more important than psychological (e.g., stress) factors in mediating the relationship with socioeconomic status. It is concluded, therefore, that a sociomedical formulation (in contrast to a sociopsychiatric formulation) is a plausible interpretation of the relationship between socioeconomic status and mental disorder.

Gould	American Journal of Sociology	98	4	1993-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 721-754	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Sociologists and historians generally agree that working-class protest in 19th-century France relied on the close-knit networks and corporate solidarity of artisanal trades. But urban uprisings invariably mobilized workers from a broad range of trades, a fact which some scholars have interpreted as evidence of growing class consciousness among French workers. This article shows that social organization within trade groups cannot account for insurgency in the Paris Commune: workers from close-knit occupational groups participated at lower rates than those in weakly organized trades. The reason was that Parisian workers were mobilized for insurgency through neighborhood networks, not through their membership in craft groups. The disappearance of trade boundaries during insurrections did not, therefore, reflect the emergence of class unity, but rather a shift from trade to neighborhood as the organizational framework for the mobilization of protest.

In support of long-held sociological theories, the article indicates that workers in traditional industries not only have more traditional moral values but are less alienated and more comfortable with themselves and their positions in society than workers in modern industries. More unexpectedly, working in the periphery decreases ideational flexibility while increasing personally responsible standards of morality. As hypothesized, the most powerful work effects are those of occupational self-direction, which continues to increase levels of intellectual flexibility and self-directed orientations even when traditionalism and peripheralness are controlled. Occupational self-direction also strongly decreases alienation and increases identification with higher social strata while being reciprocally increased by positive attitudes toward one's work.

Wolf	American Journal of Sociology	86	3	1980-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 551-583	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Based on data from an 18-year follow-up of Wisconsin high school seniors, this paper describes the process of occupational achievement among men and women from labor market entry to mid-life. In contrast to several earlier studies, there are marked sex differences in the acquisition and maintenance of occupational status. The effect of post high school education on the status of first jobs is twice as great among men as among women, and the effect of the status of first jobs on that of current jobs is one-third greater among men than among women. Men gain an average of nine points on the Duncan scale betweentheir first civilian jobs and their jobs at age 36, but women lose an average of more than two points on the Duncan scale. At the same time, sex differences in occupational attainment are not all disadvantageous to women. First jobs of women are six points higher in status on the average than first jobs of men, and when the status of first jobs is controlled, the continuing influence of schooling on occupational status is twice as great among women as among men. Consequently, as others have also found, the total effects of schooling on the occupational statuses of women and men are the same at mid-life. Among the minority of women who remain childless, the process of occupational attainment is more similar to that among men.

House, Elizabeth Bates Harkins	American Journal of Sociology	81	2	1975-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 395-412	The University of Chicago Press	fla		A model for research on social stress shows the extensive literature on status incosistency to be almost devoid of studies that are both theoretically and methodologically adequate. This model implies that status inconsistency effects should be evident (1) on proximate, perceived stresses (e.g., role conflict, anger) as opposed to distal outcomes (e.g., prejuice) and/or (2) for persons with certain personality or social characteristics. Specific hypotheses of both types are tested for occupation-education inconsistency in a sample of 310 men. Empirical evidence of inconsistency effects is found for only one of several types of proximate, perceived stresses: underload. However, as predicted, inconsistency effects of high occupation combined with low education are quite strong for men either over 45 or low in extrinsic work motivation but are not evident in other parts of the sample. Based on a small number of inconsistent persons, these results must be viewed cautiously; yet they suggest that more careful theorizing about status inconsistency may prove empirically fruitful.

It is also commonly assumed that the impact of education on career development can be investigated without reference to an individual's current organizational rank. This article shows that, with reference to promotion, several features from an employee's educational biography will influence his or her rate of advancement. It is also shown that the returns to years of schooling-and to other educational measures-vary with organizational rank; indeed, employers do not reward educational attainment indiscriminately, but only when it is likely to contribute to productivity. In conclusion, it is noted that whereas the "job-matching" literature argues that the rate of mobility is greatest when the fit between an individual's resources and a job's requirements is poor, the results with regard to promotion suggest that the converse is true.

Kemper	American Journal of Sociology	87	2	1981-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 336-362	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Social constructionist and positivist approaches to the sociology of emotions differ in three respects: (1) social constructionists generally reject the importance of the biological and physiological substrate in the determination of specific emotions, while positivists affirm the opposite view; (2) social constructionists suppose that emotions are largely determined by social norms for emotion, or "feeling rules," while positivists assert that social structure, particularly the outcomes of actors' power and status relations, determines emotions; and (3) social constructionists, following a symbolic interactionist model, propose that actors must define situations before emotions will be experienced-but they do not explain how this is done, or what categories actors use to help them define situations; positivists on the other hand ofter a specific social structural category scheme for defining situations and determining the emotions those definitions produce. These issues are discussed and suggestions for reconciling the two views are proposed.

Extensive loose coupling between formal policy and actual practice concerning female access to positions within religious organizations highlights the symbolic importance of rules about women's ordination. This paper focuses on these rules via an event-history analysis of U.S. Christian denominations' official adoption of women's ordination. The likelihood of a denomination beginning to ordain women is influenced by external political and institutional pressures, by cultural boundaries and network connections within the denominational population, and by internal organizational characterics.

Wilson	American Journal of Sociology	91	5	1986-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1154-1169	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Wirth argued that community size increases social heterogeneity but offered no rationale for this association outside the occupational sphere. More recently, subcultural theory has argued that community size leads to heterogeneity in values and attitudes that compose the sets of cultural elements of a subculture. This study is among the first to test this hypothesis. An independent size-heterogeneity relationship is found for political and sexual attitudes, which are representative of the attitudinal elements of subcultures. However, no independent size-heterogeneity relationship is found for the attitude of satisfaction, which is unlikely to be included among the elements of subcultures. It is concluded that community size does increase social heterogeneity, but, consistent with subcultural theory, the relationship is restricted to subcultural elements.

This approach can be used to study labor-force dynamics in new ways and to show how margianl work consists of several types of labor-market experience. These include most forms of job search or employment behavior identified in previous sociological and economic literature. Labor-force outcomes include both current labor-force participation and underemployment or part-time work. Both typologies are modifications of the Hauser-Sullivan-Clogg Labor Utilization Framework. The cross-classification of the two typologies provides an empirical definition of the labor-market matching process. This contingency table characterizes structure in that process. The association between labor-market experiences and labor-force outcomes is strong and remarkably stable over time.

Massey	American Journal of Sociology	92	6	1987-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1372-1403	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article draws on prior theory and research in the fields of sociology, economics, and anthropology to specify six basic propositions about international migration. These are examined using data specially collected from migrants in four Mexican communities. The migration process is divided into four phases corresponding to different events in the migrant career-departure, repetition, settlement, and return-and logit probability models are estimated to study the determinants of each event. Empirical estimates show that the likelihood of out-migration to the United States rises during stages to the life cycle when household dependence is greatest and is increased by prior migrant experiences and a lack of access to productive resource. The probability of repeat migration increases with each U.S. trip and is primarily affected by characteristics of the prior trip. The likelihood of settlement grows steadily with the accumualation of U.S. migrant experience and is principally determined by varables surrounding the migrant experience itself. The likelihood of return migration declines steadily over time but is increased by owning property in Mexico and advancing age. These result support the conceptualization of migration as a dynamic social process with a strong internal momentum.

Campbell, Idee Winfield-Laird	American Journal of Sociology	91	2	1985-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 281-308	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Numerous discussions and some previous research have suggested that the United States and Great Britain should differ in their patterns of social mobility, with Great Britain exhibiting more intergenerational continuity of social position. Some have questioned this view, however, and have offered a different hypothesis. As offered by Featherman, Jones, and Hauser, the counterhypothesis is that differences among Western industrial societies are due to historical patterns of change that affect marginal distributions but that the patterns of fluidity in these societies are the same, once marginal distribution differneces are taken into account. The present analysis, using data from the Occupational Change in a Generation Survey II and the Oxford Social Mobility Study, indicates that there is considerably more overall intergenerational and career mobility in the United States but hat the major differences between the two societies are due to shifts in the distributions of kinds of occupations. Analysis of the patterns of fluidity, once the differences in marginal distributions are taken into account, shows very minor differences between the two societies. The common mobility regimes found in the two societies involve considerable intergenerational and career continuity of position and little long distance mobility. They also involve class effects in that there are strong links within farming and professional occupations, and entrepreneurial occupations are more strongly linked to each other than with nonentrepreneurial ones. The analysis thus provides support for Featherman, Jones, and Hauser's hypothesis.

It develops a conception of a market as a status order in which each producer's status position circumscribes the producer's actions by providing a unique cost and revenue profile for manufacturing a good of a given level of quality. An examination of pricing behavior among investment banks in the underwriting of corporate securities provides impirical support for this status-based model of market competition. Extension are discussed.

Ethnic groups with a recent history of serfdom show the intellectual inflexibility, authoritarianism, and pragmatic legalistic morality previously found characteristic of American men working under occupational conditions limiting the individual's opportunity for self-direction. Although it is impossible to confirm each link in the causal chain, a model emphasizing the effects on ethnic groups' culture of historial conditions restricting the individual's autonomy seems a probable and parsimonious explanation of contemporary ethnic differences.

More specifically, it suggests that sociopolitical variables which highlight the relationship between neighborhoods and the structures of power in the city are a more important source of subcultural differences between black residential areas than are variables derived from census data such as rate of racial turnover.

Whereas it is often assumed that occupational values remain fixed throughout the work history, a confirmatory factor analysis of data obtained from male college graduates over a 10-year time span demostrates that work authonomy and income influence intrinsinc, people-oriented, and extrinsic values. Rewarding occupational experiences were found to reinforce the same values that constituted the basis of earlier work selection. The findings raise several issues for the study of social in equality.

Sampson	American Journal of Sociology	93	2	1987-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 348-382	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper examines the relationships among unemployment, crime, and family disruption in the black "underclass." The main hypothesis tested is that the effect of black adult male joblessness on black crime is mediated largely through its effects on family disruption. The study examines race-specific rates of robbery and homicide by juveniles and adults in over 150 U.S. cities in 1980. The results show that the scarcity of employed black men increases the prevalence of families headed by females in black communities. In turn, black family disruption substantially increases the rates of black murder and robbery, especially by juveniles. These effects are independent of income, region, race and age composition, density, city size, and welfare benefits and are similar to the effects of white family disruption on white violence. The paper concludes that there is nothing inherent in black culture that is conducive to crime. Rather, persistently high rates on black crime appear to stem from the structural linkages among unemployment, economic deprivation, and family disruption in urban black communities.

The data consist of judgments about the seriousness of acts embedded in social contexts, which are varied systematically to represent the theory's five structural factors. The judgments were obtained with the use of a factorial survey approach from a probability sample of household members in a small southern city. The results generally support Black's theory, although several problems are noted regarding two of his propositions.

But the focus on economic bases of elite opposition has obscured a second issue: co-optation benefits some elites at the expense of those who occupy disadvantaged positions in local patronage networks, inclining the latter to resist. This mechanism accounts for patterns of elite participation in the Whiskey Rebellion of 1794, a mass mobilization against state building in the postrevolutionary United States. Elites without patronage ties, and those whose clienteles overlapped with those of federal officers, were more likely to mobilize against the state.

It is analyzed as the outcome of intraorganizational conflics between elites of two parallel stuctures within denominations: religious authority and agencies. Using longitudinal data collected from 83 Protestant denominations, this article finds that, generally, religious authority has decreasing control over denominations' organizational resources. But internal secularization is neither complete nor irreversible. Drawing on organizational and social movement theory, this article connects variation in internal secularization primarily to variation in the extent to which both religious authority and agencies are centralized. Recently resurgent religious authority is discussed.

It distinguishes between the erosion and transition phases and between traditional and corporate segments in the emerging private sector. Panel survey data from Hungary show that during the transition ex-communist cadres maintain their advantageous position and do especially well in the more dynamic corporate segment. They are successful because human capital is important in both capitalism and socialism and because the cadres are able to convert past political power to economic advantage. Contrary to the findings of studies based only on agriculture, the transition increases income inequalities.

Separate measures of paternal proximity, affection, and responsibility for routine child care are positively associated with female participation in community decision making, female access to position of authority, and female origin symbolism. Multiple regression and contingency table analyses indicate that father-child relationships have a significant effect on female status not accounted for by other social structural or child socialization variables. Statistical analyses and ethnographic comparisons suggest that the sexual division of labor in child care interacts with other institutionalized forms of male dominance to influence the relative position of women. Theoretical explanations for the link between gender-differentiated child rearing and public status are discussed.

Class revolt and fisical crisis were the ultimate causes of elite consolidation, but Medicean political control was produced by means of network disjunctures within the elite, which the Medici alone spanned. Cosimo de' Medici's multivocal identity as sphinx harnessed the power available in these network holes and resolved the contradiction between judge and boss inherent in all organizations. Methodologically, we argue that to understand state formation one must penetrate beneath the veneer of formal institutions, groups, and goals down to the relational substrata of peoples' actual lives. Ambiguity and heterogeneity, not planning and self- interest, are the raw materials of which powerful states and persons are constructed.

This article uses world-system concepts and the case of the Irish and English cotton industries to argue that innovations are not intrinsically local but must be localized. Irish and English customs data and historical analysis are used to demonstrate how the localization of innovation around Manchester involved the peripheralization of the Irish industry by Britain. This peripheralization involved, first, the destruction of Irish spinning and the subjugation of Irish weaving and, eventually, the transformation of Irish textile activity into linen. It is further argued that innovation (Schumpeter's innovative response) is the defining characteristic of coreactivities, while adaptive response characterizes semiperipheral industry.

The analysis includes discussion of precharismatic conditions in post-Napoleonic France, the nature of Saint-Simon's charismatic appeal, three separable efforts to "routinize" this authority, and the relationship between the material and political interests of French Jews and the ideas of Saint-Simon's New Christianity. The conclusion suggests that this charismatic phenomenon had two paradoxical consequences: Saint-Simonism did little to advance the interests of French Jews, but much to advance French industry and commerce; it did much to preserve Saint-Simon's ideas, but only in a selective and distorted form.

The paper argues through comparative analysis that organizational growth is best explained by market and cultural factors but that authority patterns and legitimation strategies best explain organizational structure.

(1) There were large reductions in differences between white and nonwhite occupational distributions at all ages, with the change clearest for young men. (2) The reduction of differences in these distributions is clearest at the lowest and highest educational levels. (3) The absolute gap between nonwhite and white income (in constant dollars) increased. (4) The increased income gap is due in large part to a general upward shift of the labor force into education/occupation categories with a more pronounced income differential by race. Comparisons are made with changes from 1950 to 1960 in order to evaluate recent chages in a broader context.

Under the assumption that age effects can be treated as negligible, the article evaluates the importance of period and cohort effects in shaping the present racial attitudes of adults who have come of age since 1959. After outlining two possible patterns of differences among cohorts that could have resulted from the impact of historical circumstances during the formative years of early adulthood, the article concludes that there is no indication of decreasing tolerance among cohorts coming of age in the 1980s. Similarly the period effects are seldom significant over the years from 1984-90 and thus show no consistent decline in racial liberalism.

Logan, Mark Schneider	American Journal of Sociology	89	4	1984-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 874-888	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Black migration to American suburbs accelerated in the 1970-80 period, increasing the proportion black in the suburban ring in all four major geographic regions of the country. The evidence presented here demonstrates that this process followed well-established patterns of segregation: in most SMSAs, the black population in 1980 was about as unequally distributed among suburbs as it had been in 1970. In the North, blacks moved disproportionately into communities with high initial black concentrations, while the majority of white suburbs gained very few black residents. In the South, in contrast, there were many cases of displacement, that is, black suburbs experienced declining black concentration. Finally, multivariate analysis of predictors of racial change in the North shows that an increase in the proportion of blacks has been significantly associated with high population density, proximity to the central city, residential instability, weak property tax base, and high tax rates.

This article examines how sympathy flows between sympathizer and sympathizee in our society's "emotional economy." Data from field observations, surveys, interviews, and content analyses show that sympathy margins exist as a right of group membership. The sizes of one's sympathy margins vary with, among a host of factors, one's sympathy biography or past adherence to sympathy etiquette. Rules of sympathy etiquette for sympathizees are the following: (1) do not make unwarranted claims to sympathy, (2) do not claim too much sympathy, (2a) do not accepts sympathy too readily, (3) claim and accept some sympathy to keep sympathy accounts open, and (4) repay sympathy with gratitude, with sympathy, or with both. Sympathizers are expected to enforce these rules; people who under-or overinvest are considered deviant sympathizers. Finally, sympathy processes may be used, consciously or unconsciously, for micropolitical ends.

White	American Journal of Sociology	94	6	1989-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1277-1302	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Concentrating on the development of one politically violent organization, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), leads to conclusions that differ from more aggregate approaches. A quantitative examination of the development of IRA violence in a community mobilized for peaceful protest shows that state repression, not economic deprivation, was the major determinant of this violence. Intensive interviews with IRA supporters help to interpret these quantitative results by showing that, before endorsing political violence, victims of repression must (1) view the authority repressing them as illegitimate, (2) view peaceful protest in the face of repression as ineffective, and (3) consider the reactions to repression of people with whom they have close ties. These responses to repression appear to be continued by social placement; that is, in contrast to members of the middle class, members of the working class and student activists are more likely to experience repression, to be available for constly violent protest, and to experience the efficacy of political violence.

When the crucial political arrangements are held constant, there is no relationship between monotheism and a society's principal methods for obtaining food. These political arrangements are related to monotheism when the type of sustenance activity is controlled.

Lichter	American Journal of Sociology	93	4	1988-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 771-792	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The geographic mismatch between where blacks reside and where jobs are located is frequently cited as contributing to the growing black underclass in the nation's urban centers. The "spatial mismatch" hypothesis provides a framework for identifying several facets of change in the comparative employment circumstances of central city black and white men. Specifically, this paper examines black-white differences in underemployment during the 1970-82 period, employing the Labor Utilization Framework of Clogg and Sullivan. Using data from the Current Population Survey, the results provide little basis for optimism about the absolute or relative employment circumstances of urban black men. The analysis reveals that (a) underemployment increased over time for both whites and blacks but especially among young adults and those with low education; (b) racial polarization accelerated during 1970-82 in U.S. central cities, as the absolute gap in underemployment between blacks and whites increased substantially; (c) the significance of race increased over time, regardless of age group, level of education, or temporal macroeconomic shifts; and (d) the effects of education and age increased over time, suggesting a growing class-based and age-based bifurcation in the adequacy of employment in U.S. central cities.

Demo	American Journal of Sociology	95	1	1989-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 132-159	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This study examines the determinants of personal self-esteem, racial self-esteem, and personal efficacy in a 1980 national sample of black Americans. The findings show that the three dimensions are interrelated each is anchored in interpersonal relations with family and friend. However, the three dimensions are produced by fundamentally different processes. Personal self-esteem is most strongly influenced by microsocial relations with family, friends, and community, while personal efficacy is generated through experiences in social statuses embedded in macrosocial systems of social inequality. We conclude that black self-esteem is insulated from systems of racial inequality, while personal efficacy is not, and suggest that this explains why black Americans have relatively high self-esteem but low personal efficacy. The belief that racial discrimination, rather than individual failure, accounts for low achievement among blacks is irrelevant to personal self-esteem and personal efficacy. In contrast, racial self-esteem is produced by a combination of education, interracial contact, and ideological processes.

However, his conception of culture consigned it to a totally subjective realm, rendering its explanatory power retrospective, hypothetical, and largely circular. This article take slocal culture to be part of the objective world, directly visible in such artifacts as statues, street names, or bumper stickers. Experts can and do claim to understand these artifacts, and their claims, rather than mass sentiments, are what count in establishing their meaning. If we take this view, we can begin to build a plausible account of the durability of local American urban cultures, of the strong images that seem to be attributed to our "shock cities," and of the resistance some places show to land conversion and redevelopment. Such a conception of local culture makes it, not a residual left over after economic analysis has its say, but an integral element in an ecological approach which increasingly draws implicitly or explicitly on social as well as economic differences in explaining our urban society.

Through a multilevel analysis, it shows that economic growth depresses the retunrs to education and work experience and does not affect the net differences between party members and nonmembers and between men and women. Overall earning inequality remains low and only slightly correlated with economic growth because, in faster-growing cities, the tendency toward higher levels of inequality is somewhat offset by the lower returns to human capital. A plausible interpretation is that these results are largely due to the lack of a true labor market in urban China.

Data from 1940 to 1970 plus an extended analysis of 1970 data reveal that segregation levels are enhanced by southern birth of both blacks and whites. The effects of southern birth on segregation are shown to hold when city size and percentage black are controlled. Implications of the findings for urban research and assimilation theory are briefly discussed.

A definite trend toward approval of marital dissolution is observed between 1962 and 1980. A theoretical model of the determinants of attitudes shows that affiliation with Catholicism or fundamentalist Protestantism tends to reduce approval of marital dissolution, but that between 1962 and 1980 the effect of Catholicism declined and the effect of fundamentalist religion increased. Church attendance also has an important traditional influence on marital dissolution attitudes. Older women had the most approving attitudes in 1962, but they experienced the smallest subsequent change. Age at marriage is also negatively related to approval of marital dissolution. Attitudes toward marital dissolution are shown to have little influence on subsequent marital dissolution, whereas a marital dissolution influences attitudes significantly. There is substantial stability of individual attitudes over time, and mothers have an important influence on the attitudes of their children.

Burt	American Journal of Sociology	85	4	1980-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 892-925	The University of Chicago Press	fla		My purpose here is to define and illustrate a concept of "structural autonomy" based on recent developments in network analysis. The concept is stated in terms of the pattern of relations defining a network position, and it incorporates aspects of oligopoly from economics and group-affiliation from sociology. Eight hypotheses are derived from the proposed concept. These hypotheses concern the effects on autonomy of aspects of the pattern of relations defining a network position, the places in social structure where cooptive relations should appear (as well as places where they should not), and the increase in autonomy that can be expected from effective cooptation. Numerical illustration is provided. As a useful research site, firms in manufacturing industries of the 1967 American economy are treated as structurally equivalent actors, and total profits in an industry are taken to be a result of the relative autonomy of firms in separate industries. The autonomy hypotheses are used to explain relative industry profits and strategies for coopting other firms. Those industries with high structural autonomy tend to have high profits. Firms in an industry tend to purchase other firms in mergers patterned to coopt constraints on the industry's structural autonomy.

Sampson	American Journal of Sociology	96	6	1991-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1402-1440	The University of Chicago Press	fla		During the 1930, Edwin Sutherland established the sociological model of crime as the dominant paradigm in criminology and as a result became the most influential criminologist of the 20th century. This article examines Sutherland's debate with Sheldon Glueck and Eleanor Glueck about the causes of crime and the proper focus of social science research. Previously unavailable correspondence and unpublished papers are examined along with published works from the period (1925-45) when Sutherland was developing the theory of differential association and the Gluecks were launching research on criminal careers. The competing paradigms of the Gluecks and Sutherland are also placed in the socio-intellectual and institutional context in which they worked. It is shown that Sutherland's attack on the Gluecks' interdisciplinary research program was driven by: (a) a substantive version of sociological positivism that attempted to establish criminology as the proper domain of sociology, (b) a commitment to the method of analytic induction, and (c) Sutherland's rise to prominence in sociology. In addition, key aspects of the Gluecks' perspective reflecting their own professional interests in law and psychiatry further contributed to sociologists' hostile reaction. Nevertheless, the article presents evidence that the Gluecks' research on such fundamental issues as age and crime, criminal careers, and social control is more correct than commonly believed and, in fact, occupies center stage in contemporary research.

Rindfuss	American Journal of Sociology	90	5	1985-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1055-1077	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Relying heavily on Ryder's (1965) argument concerning the central role of cohorts in social change and on Elder's (1978) work on life cycles, this paper integrates the disparate threads of the current marital disruption literature and provides an integrated framework for subsequent analysis. We focus on the study of intracohort life cycle development and comparative cohort careers. Our framework incorporates both elements simultaneously. Using 1980 Current Population Survey data and conditional logit analysis, this framework allows us to make refined statements about which marriage cohorts are most affected by given variables and where within the cohort's life cycle they act. For instance, we show that both the timing of the marriage and maritally conceived births affect the likelihood of disruption in all cohorts and at all marital durations observed. In contrast, the wife's level of education and a premarital birth affect the likelihood of marital disruption only at early marital durations. Such variable patterns of effects along the temporal dimensions of cohort and duration provide important clues to the mechanisms by which these variables influence marital disruption.

Drawing on the relatively large qualitative literature on wife battering, the paper examines the inner side of the violent experience in the home. Emotionality and the self are posited as being at the core of domestic violence. The analysis takes up in order the following topics: (1) emotionality and violent conduct; (2) schismogenesis and negative symbolic interaction; (3) the structure of violent emotion; (4) violent emotional action; (5) inflicted emotion; (6) spurious playful, paradoxical, and real violence; and (7) the interiority of family violence and bad faith. New critical theory in this area is needed.

Some of the consequences of these curvilinear relationships will be illustrated by describing three common types. After specifying the major determinants of these three types, I will use them to help explain four outcomes. The relationships provide an explanation for important aspects of mobility systems within organizations. Additional consequences include the probability that workers will be sympathetic to collective bargaining and horizontal movements between organizations. The hree relationships between individual and organizational performance also act as a primary determinant of control process within organizations and the individual adaptations that result.

Residential succession was much less prevalent in Hispanic areas than in black areas, and established Hispanic areas were quite rare. However, for both groups average SES fell as areas underwent transition from Anglo to established minority areas. The main difference between Hispanic and black areas was that invasion was followed by succession in less than 50% of cases. Whether tracts lost or gained Anglos following invasion by Hispanics dependend on the objective characteristics of the invaders and the location of the tract relative to established minority areas. Overall, blacks were much less able to translate status attainments into mobility out of the ghetto and into contact with Anglos. Path models of Hispanic and black spatial assimilation revealed structural differences in processes between the two groups. Given the same socioeconomic inputs,the ultimate probability of residential contact with Anglos was much lower for blacks than for Hispanics. Results contradict the view that race is declining in importance within U.S. society.

McLaughlin	American Journal of Sociology	96	4	1991-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 843-867	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Previous research has typically ignored the spatial dimension of marriage markets, focusing instead on highly aggregated data or on individual models of entry into marriage. A basic premise of this study is that national marriage rates are played out across local marriage-market areas that define female opportunities for marriage. Using local area data from the newly released 1980 Public Use Microdata Sample (D file), the article provides a direct test of several alternative explanations of U.S. marital behavior and of black and white differences in marriage rates. The analysis reveals that (a)local economic opportunities (including welfare)for females, spouse availability, and urbanization contribute significantly to spatial variations is female marriage rates, (b) the lcoal supply of economically "attractive" males plays an especially large role in the marital behaviors of U.S. black and white women, and (c) racial differences in marriage-market conditions accentuate, but do not explain completely, black-white differences in U.S. marriage rates. The study reinforces the view that local marriage-market conditions play a fundamental and often unappreciated role in the marital search process of American women.

Konda	American Journal of Sociology	88	4	1983-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 637-685	The University of Chicago Press	fla		It is commonly held that an individual's career prospects decline the higher he or she rises in an organization. In many cases this is not true; this paper identifies four organizational microstructures and two triggering mechanisms that provide clues for assessing one's career prospects in different organizations. The four microstructures are grade ratios, vacancy chains, managerial selection preferences, and cohort size. Growth and exit rates are important triggering mechanisms prompting these microstructures into action. In addition, the effects of being identified as a "star" are shown as they are mediated through these organizational structures. Since the microstructures stretch across the full set of hierarchical grades, they are used to explicate the sequential career chances over the full organizational career span and the comparative level of difficulty at each promotion "gateway." Biases from both retrospective and panel data also indicate the importance of sampling from labor markets as well as from career streams to identify the underlying structures that operate alongside the more commonly studied heterogeneity of individuals. The approach used here links three usually disparate areas-labor, organizations, and demography-and in some cases extends the results of stable population theory within organizational demography. Data from three organizations-in both private and public sectors-are used to illustrate the model and to conduct empirical tests and thereby provide initial confirmation of the theory.

Detailed occupations of newlyweds in the 1970 and 1980 censuses are analyzed. Scales of cultural and economic occupational status are developed, and long-linear models of scaled association are used to analyze 70 x 70 occupational marriage tables. It is found that assortative mating by economic status, the economic dimension of status homogamy is more important when people marry late, and economic stats homogamy has increased between 1970 and 1980 at the expense of cultural status homogamy.

The historical record of the development and spread of nuclear weapons and the recollections of their designers suggest that tacit knowledge is also crucial to nuclear weapons development. Therefore, if design ceases, and if there is no new generation of designers to whom that tacit knowledge can be passed, then in an important (though qualified) sense nuclear weapons will have been uninvented. Their renewed development would thus have some of the characteristics of reinvention rather than simply copying. In addition, knowledge may be lost not only as a result of complete disarmament, but also as a consequence of likely measures such as a nuclear test ban.

Nelson	American Journal of Sociology	85	4	1980-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 870-891	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Poisson and negative binomial models are applied to the number of multiple victimizations reported in the National Crime Surveys. The negative binomial but not the Poisson models is shown to be compatible with the data. The negative binomial model is consistent with the hypothesis that the probability of being victimized is constant over time and does not depend upon the number of prior victimizations, but that not all persons, businesses, and households have the same probability of being victimized. This interpretation can be used to estimate the probability of being victimized conditional upon the number of victimizations experienced in an observation period and to estimate the maximum correlation between independent variables and the number of victimizations experienced in a given time interval. Regardless of the interpretation, the analysis shows that victimization rates are not unduly affected by small numbers of persons having unusually high rates. Researchers using large data sets are likely to find similar patterns between victimization counts and independent variables using either rates or probabilities to measure victimization.

Gillis	American Journal of Sociology	95	2	1989-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 307-341	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Historians and other social scientists argue that cultural change and increasing civility generated a five-century decline in rates of violent crime. This study presents a structural perspective that indicates that, as emerging nation-states consolidated power, they also extended surveillance, and this deterred cirme. The proposition is tested in France, between 1865 and 1913, where rates of major crimes declined and minor offenses increased as state surveillance expanded in the form of two national police forces. A time-series anlaysis suggests that, although the growth of policing initially increased charges for all types of crime, for major crimes the long-run effect was deterrence and declining rates. Subsequent deterrent effects failed to compensate for the initial inflationary effect on minor offenses, so rates increased. The effect of policing on major property crime holds when the possibility of reclassification of such crimes as minor offenses is controlled, but the deflationary effect of policing on major crimes of violence disappears when urbanization is introduced as a control. The other relationships persist, further supporting the idea that policing contributed to the decline in serious property crime. A reversal of the equations shows that crime rates had little or no effect on the growth of national policing. This, and historical evidence, suggests that state surveillance expanded less from a specific intent to control crime that from a broader interest in repressing "dangerous classes," new repertoires of social protest, and politcal challenge to the state.

The model emphasizes the importance of both structural and individual motivational factors in high-risk/cost activism; contending that an intense ideological identification with the values of the movement disposes the individual toward participation, while a prior history of activism and integration into supportive networks acts as the structural "pull" encouraging the individual to make good on his or her strongly held beliefs. The utility of the model is then analyzed in relation to a single instance of high-risk/cost activism: the 1964 Freedom Summer project. Data from project applications for 720 persons who actually went to Mississippi, as well as from 241 "no shows," are used to explain the applicants' chances of participation in terms of various factors. The results of this analysis generally confirm the importance of microstructural factors in recruitment to the campaign. Participants were distinguished from withdrawals primarily on the basis of their (a) greater number of organizational affiliations, (b) higher levels of prior civil rights activity, and (c) stronger and more extensive ties to other participants.

Althauser	American Journal of Sociology	87	3	1981-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 651-683	The University of Chicago Press	fla		How economic segmentation generates income inequality constitutes a central question for theories of economic and social organization and of socioeconomic achievement. Previous research emphasizes two sources of the structural variation in income: (1) employers with large amounts of resources, for a variety of reasons, may find it in their interests to pay workers higher wages; and (2) some workers are able to acquire power against their employers as well as against other workers and can therefore extract higher earnings. In this paper, we investigate several issues involved in the links among economic segmentation, worker power, and income inequality. We argue that the structure of economic segmentation is multidimensional and reflects such distinct concepts as concentration, economic scale, state intervention in the market, capital intensity, and organization size. Worker power also is derived from diverse sources, such as union membership, occupational skill and licensing, class position, and tenure with an employer. We construct measures of these two sets of concepts and examine their relationships and effects on income with data from two national samples of individuals. We also relate economic segmentation to issues raised by the socioeconomic achievement literature; in particular, we find that the effect of education on income differs among firm and industrial contexts.

Featherman	American Journal of Sociology	82	6	1977-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1242-1288	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Biases due to measurement errors in structural equation models of the intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic status were asessed by estimating unobserved variable models with data from the remeasurement program of the 1973 Occupational Changes in a Generation-II survey. We found persuasive evidence that reports of social background and achievement variables by nonblack males are subject to strickly random errors, while reports by black males are subject to significant nonrandom error. When measurement errors are ignored for nonblacks, occupational returns to schooling are underestimated by about 15%, the effects of some background variables are underestimated by as much as 22%, and variation in socioeconomic achievements not attributable to education or social origins is underestimated by as much as 27%. Biases appear to be substantially greater for blacks. Consequently, ignoring measurement error exaggerates racial differences in returns to schooling and occupational inequality not attributable to social origins.

Roy	American Journal of Sociology	86	6	1981-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1287-1310	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The issue addressed is, What does a social group need to gain political power? Empirical, historical, historical analysis is utilized to explore the relative saliency of three determinants of political power to explain variation in power as defined conceptually and operationally independent from its determinants. The determinants are magnitude, the extent to which the group is tied into economic, political, and social networks, and the degree of mobilization. The aspect of power investigated is the vesting of economic interests, that is, the extent to which the interests of an actor are taken into account by the government in its routine operation. Regression analysis is used to assess the relative explanatory power of the magnitude, network relations, and degree of mobilization of 12 industries on the vesting of economic interests in the U.S. Department of State in the period 1886-1905. Results show that the different components have different explanatory value under varying conditions, depending on the type of interest that is vested. When the State Department was discussing export-related matters the value of exports was the best predictor of vesting, with mobilization having a secondary impact. However, the effect of network relations was notably weak, contrary to predictions of the power-elite perspective. The conclusion stresses the contingent nature of the determinants of political power.

Cook	American Journal of Sociology	93	4	1988-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 833-851	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article presents an extension of recent work on exchange networks and specifies theoretically the implications of different types of network connections for the distribution of power. The paper employs power-dependence principles to make predictions concerning the distribution of power in differently organized exchange networks. The results of several laboratory experiments are reported testing these predictions. Computer simulation results are also presented testing predictions that extend beyond the experimental work. The findings demonstrate that the locus of power in exchange networks is determined by the nature of the network connections (positive, negative, or mixed) and the scarcity of resources, factors that alter the underlying dependency relations.

Vanneman	American Journal of Sociology	85	1	1979-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 135-155	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Neither modernization studies nor the new world-system approach to development has treated bureaucrats as an autonomous group pursuing its own interests in competition and collusion with other social groups. An examination of bureaucrats and higher-education politics in Thailand, India, and China over the past three decades reveals a notably similar vision of group interest, despite great differences in historical origin and in the success with wich these interest, despite great differences in historical origin and in the success with which these interest have been pursued. The comparative success of Thailand's bureaucrats and failure of China's can be illuminated in part by considering differences in relationship to the world system, although this is by no means a sufficient explanation. Bureaucrats choose allies in conjuction with possibilities presented by the world system, as well as by such internal factors as the strenght of rival social groups and the continuity of bureaucratic organization. Theories of development are currently in considerable flux; the world-system contribution would gain analytical power by adopting a more realistic perception of bureaucrats.

The results provide strong evidence that women who spend part of their childhoods in one-parent families are more likely to marry and bear children early, give birth before marriage, and have their own marriages break up. The major exception is that, among blacks, early marriage is unrelated to family background. Several explanations for intergenerational consequences are tested, including the economic-deprivation hypothesis, the socialization hypothesis, and the stress hypothesis. The results are most consistent with the socialization explanation, which argues that parental role models and parental supervision are the major factors in determining offspring's future family-formation behavior.

Iannaccone	American Journal of Sociology	94		1988-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. S241-S268	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The sociology of religion is an area rich in generalizations but poor in theory. Against this background, economic models offer the hope of better theory and more precise predictions. Previous work has failed to deliver on this promise because of its narrow focus on time and money. This paper gives center stage to normative conduct, an entirely different aspect of religious activity. Churches and sects emerge as analytically distinct modes of religious organization rather than ad-hoc categories. The theoretical consequences of a sectarian orientation include strict behavioral standards, definite conversions, resistance to social change, high levels of religious participation, and lower-class and minority appeal.

In the course of doing so, we establish that SSIC cannot be seen as a "corrected" prestige or socioeconomic scale, nor is it a convincing proxy for the total assets and resources embedded in occupations. We argue that SSIC might be reinterpreted as the dominant dimension underlying patterns of intergenerational contact; however, some of the competing "network scales" tap a broader range of relational processes, and it would therefore be difficult to salvage a major role for SSIC within this tradition. We conclude by asking whether SSIC should be privileged relative to alternative scales that maximize other bivariate correlations.

Yet England's political history and institutions strikingly deviate from what Weberian or Marxist ideal-types of capitalist development might lead us to expect. This article argues that these deviations are important in explaining why England became the home of capitalism in the first place. Particular stress is put upon the earliness of England's formation as a national state, or the continuites of its major legal and political institutions, and what are often seen as their amateurish "irrationalities" in molding, over the very longue durée, a civil society in which capitalist economy was possible. If so, the pertinence of Marxist and Weberian ideal-types to a historical sociology of capitalism, whether in England or elsewhere, needs very seriously to be reconsidered.

A structural-Marxist understanding of contradictory social relations that contour life in modern capitalism allows us to reinterpret and apply the insights from various criminology theories in building a new theoretical approach. A review and critique of the major theoretical perspectives in criminology are provided, and a structural-Marxist perspective on the larger social structural context is explicated. A new integrated theory of delinquency, grounded in Marxian insights on the role of productive relations in shaping other social relations, is developed and supported with empirical evidence from research representing a broad range of theoretical perspectives.

Evidence from the 1977 Quality of Employment Survey shows that the combination of both schedule flexibility and ease of job performance most clearly reduces job-family conflict for parents. However, mothers employed over 30 hours a week are not more likely to be in jobs with those characteristics, nor are predominantly female jobs in general likely to possess that cluster of characteristics shown to reduce job-family conflict.

To attempt an answer, we shall compare the major dimensions in the experience of young people within one city prior to and during early industrialization. In particular, three broad issues frame our inquiry into specific patterns of residence, education, work, and marriage and into the way in which class and ethnicity affected the shape of experience. Those three issues are universality of adolescence, the relations between parents and children, and the social consequences of public education. We begin with the issues.

A formal theoretical model is developed that extends previous work on threshold models of collective behavior. Spatial distribution of a population influences the network that are likely to emerge within the population; these network, in turn, will influence the likely outcome of a mobilization effort. Key theoretical predictions are tested using data on the founding of local union organizations in Sweden, 1890-1940. The empirical analyses show that contagious spatial processes were of considerable importance for the growth of the Swedish union movement, thus supporting the theoretical argument. The analyses presented in the article provide an alternative interpretation of density-dependent founding rates to the one offered by organizational ecologists.

Concretely, it examines the effects of different types and levels of corporate control, adjusted for the effects of corporate size and performance, on three dimensions of compensation among 218 industrial corporations during 1975 and 1976. In order to assess the power of the chief executive officer in relation to other directors, the analysis employs a hierarchy of control configurations based on the distribution of stock ownerwhip among the members of the board of directors. In general, the results confirm the hypothesis that the remuneration received by a chief executive officer is directly related to his power within the corporation. A major exception to this pattern involves chief executive officers who are also principal stockholders in their corporations and receive dividend income from their stock.

The role of schooling into dollars of earnings. This paper reexamines the role of returns of schooling in producing differences in earnings of white and black men who are employed in the same occupation. The role of schooling in determining wages of all workers is also considered. A hypothesis suggesting that years of schooling and years of labor-force experience have joint nonadditive effects on earnings is formulated, tested, and supported by several regression analyses. A measure of race differences in wage returns to schooling based on partial derivatives is computed from separate regression analyses of earnings of white and black males in each of 62 detailed occupation categories. These occupation categories. These occupation categories subtend 79% of the black male labor force (and 68% of the total labor force) which reported its occupation in the 1960 census of population. The results surprisingly indicate that within-occupation race differences in wage returns to schooling are not large enough to cause substantial race differences in pay for incumbents of those occupations employing the vast majority of black men in the labor force. This finding suggests that racial differences in the quality of schooling are largely irrelevant to within-occupation race differences in earnings.

Carter	American Journal of Sociology	88	2	1982-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 296-310	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Residential segregation is most commonly measured with the index of dissimilarity, an indicator that eliminates or at least minimizes the effect of group size. An asymmetric measure of isolation is described here, one which takes composition into account. Although it taps the same process in part, the measure provides a different way of approaching segregation and is found not to be a simple product of a composition variable coupled with the index of dissimilarity. Earlier conclusions about intercity differences and temporal changes in segregation between 1960 and 1970 are reconsidered. Centrain features of segregation are indicated that hitherto were unappreciated. Recognition of them yields some radically different conclusions about the segregation process, shifts over time, and differences among cities. The asymmetrical approach also explains why racial and ethnic groups have different perceptions about the magnitude of and the trends in segregation.

Cohen	American Journal of Sociology	95	4	1990-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 922-963	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This study demonstrate that the empirical literature on the structural convariates of homicide rates contains inconsistent findings across different time periods and different geographical units. This apparent variance of findings may be due to statistical or methodological artifacts of particular studies, such as different time periods covered, units of analysis, samples, model specification, and problems of statistical analysis and inference. A baseline regression model using 11 structural covariates is estimated for cities, metropolitan areas, and states in 1960, 1970, and 1980. The empirical estimates of this model exhibit instability because of high levels of collinearity among several regressors. Principal components analysis is applied to simplify the dimensionally of the structural covariate space. Reestimation of the regression model then indicates that the apparent inconsistencies across time and social space are greatly reduced. The theoretical significance of the findings for substantive theories of violent crime are discussed.

Sorensen	American Journal of Sociology	85	2	1979-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 361-384	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper proposes a theory of the status attainment process and specifies it in a mathematical model. The theory justifies both a transformation of the conventional status scores to a metric producing an exponential distribution of attainments and a transformation of educational attainments to a metric reflecting the competitive advantage conferred by education. The new metric produces theoretically more meaningful results than the old one when used together with the proposed model in an analysis of change in status. The metric also performs better statistically with the proposed model as well as with conventional models for the level of status. An empirical analysis demonstrates that career opportunities are less favorable for women than for men and for blacks than for whites.

Drawing on a dual economy interpretation of the relationship between economic organization and labor market structure, we identify a set of empirical indicators which relate to the degree of oligopoly versus competition in industrial settings. We use factor analysis to test the dual economists' expectation of a common dimension underlying indicators of economic concentration and scale and the characteristics of product and labor markets. After confirming this expectation, we use factor scores to define an index of segmentation for industrial categories. Finally, we demonstrate the application of dichotomous and continuous segmentation measures to the analysis of a simple earnings determination model.

Recent Scholarship, however, has challenged this view. This study explores the relationship between levels of literacy in rural France toward the end of 18th century and the extent and nature of peasant mobilization at the beginning of the French Revolution. It is found that literacy did not promote rural disturbances as such but that the forms and targets of peasant actions in the more literate areas difered from those in the less literate. The less literate districts were notable for mobilization against rumored but nonexistent invasions, whereas the most literate districts nurtured attacks on the central social institutions of the Old Regime.

One perspective argues that discriminatory practices in the marketing of real estate are responsible. Another view contends that it is the preferences of both blacks and whites for their own neighborhoods that maintain segregation. Using data from the Detroit Area Study of 1976 and 1992, the authors test the hypothesis that stereotypes among whites play an important role in explaining their resistance to integrated neighborhoods. They conclude that stereotype use links white preferences to discriminatory real estate practices in a way that helps to explain the persistence of segregation in the Detroit area.

Haines	American Journal of Sociology	93	5	1988-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1200-1223	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The explanatory form of Spencer's theory of social evolution has been persistently misunderstood in the sociological literature. This paper challenges the conventional interpretation that Spencer proposed a theory of immanent change to establish that his is an evolutionary theory in the modern biological sense. Proponents of the immanence interpretation have failed to grasp the role that Lamarckian and von Baerian models of change play in Spencer's theories of organic and superorganic evolution. Their case against Spencer and evolutionary theory more generally attacks a model of change Spencer had already rejected. Instead of providing support for the standard sociological definition of evolution and its corollary, the argument for deconstruction, Spencer's theory of social change points to the need for a fundamental rethinking of the terms of the debate over evolutionary theory in sociology.

Evidence concerning the social origins of physicians in Thailand was collected from 1934 to 1966 and from a questionnaire survey administered to 666 male students in 1966. For the past four decades the medical profession has been accessible almost exclusively to the children of the elite classes. Despite this class closure, the expansion of the medical profession is linked with a substantial increase in status mobility from families that own commercial shops. This movement from the bourgeoisie into the government bureaucracy indicates the relevance of Weber's theory of patrimonial authority for comparative analysis.

Findings suggest that the more advantaged community, the Cuban enclave, is characterized by highly interdependent industries, ones which are less dependent on majority industry; the less advantaged community, the black enclave, is characterized by weakly interdependent industries, ones which are more dependent on majority industry. In addition, hypotheses are suggested which link the structuring of enclave economies to traditional concerns with background cultural, historical, and situational influences. The usefulness of input-output analysis and the limitations of secondary data are discussed.

In 1977, suicides, motor vehicle deaths, and nonfatal accidents all rose immediately following soap opera suicide stories. The U.S. female suicide increased proportionally more than male suicides. Single-vehicle crashes increased more than multiplevehicle crashes. All of these increases are statiscally significant and persist after one corrects for the presence of nonfictional suicide stories, linear trends, seasonal fluctuations, and day-of-the-week fluctuations in the data. These increases apparently occur because soap opera suicide stories trigger imitative suicides and suicides attempts, some of which are disguised as single-vehicle accidents.

Maynard	American Journal of Sociology	97	2	1991-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 448-495	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article investigates the way in which physicians or clinicians apparently advance their professional dominance by ignoring lifeworld concerns of the patients of clients they see. Usual analyses of this phenomenon invoke conceptions of authority to explain it implicitly, or they propose that the asymmetry of clinical discourse relies solely on an institutional basis. In order to discover and analyze interactional aspects of the clinical encounter, comparative studies between institutional and everyday contexts are necessary. This article demonstrates that, through the use of a conversational "perspective display series," which is adapted to the clinical environment, a delivery of "bad" diagnosis news can coimplicate the patient's perspective and promote understanding and the appearance of agreement between clinician and patient. In general, describing manifestations of institutional power and authority should include analysis of the ways that participants organize interaction in the first place.

Organizational democracy is not the impossibility indicated by such sociological theories as Michels's "iron law of oligarchy," Weber's view of leadership professionalization, and the neo-Marxist perspective that political and economic environments heavily influence internal organizational structure. The potential for organizational democracy is related to a reform group's ability to strengthen its own internal democratic processes by consciously adopting certain structures and strategies, such as a system of officers and elections, an open decision-making process, regular communication with grass-roots members, an emphasis on consistent political ideology, and long-term political goals.

Baker	American Journal of Sociology	89	4	1984-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 775-811	The University of Chicago Press	fla		In this article, a national securities market-the stock options market-is characterized as a social structure represented by the networks of actors who traded options on the floor of a major securities exchange. Trading among actors exhibited distinct social structural patterns that dramatically affected the direction and magnitude of option price volatility. The argument that this market is socially structured is constructed in four parts: behavioral assumptions about the nature of economic actors, models of micronetworks, models of macronetworks, and price consequences. In the ideal-typical model of the market, actors are assumed to be hyperrational and never to act opportunistically. With these behavioral assumptions, the micronetworks of actors should be expansive, a condition which would result in undifferentiated and homogeneous macronetworks. Such macronetworks would tend to reduce the volatility of option prices. But in the empirical market studied here, actors are subject to bounded rationality and some act opportunistically. Because of these behavioral constraints, actors' micronetworks are restrictive. In large markets, restrictive micronetworks generate well-differentiated macronetworks; both large size and differentiation impede communication among actors, a fact which results in exacerbated option price volatility. In Small markets,restrictive micronetworks generate less differentiated market are conductive to efficient communication which results in dampened option price volatility. The findings are discussed in relation to some major premises in microeconomic theory, and some consequent implications for public policy are presented.

Savelsberg	American Journal of Sociology	97	5	1992-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1346-1381	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Chances of realizing a legal rationality that does not fit society are limited. Referring to weber's "Sociology of Law," to related themes in the sociology of polity, organizations, and occupations, and to recent debates on technocratization, juridification, delegalization, and responsive law, this article presents a theoretical discussion of this thesis. An empirical case, using the neoclassical concept of sentencing guidelines, exemplified by the federal and Minnesota cases, supports the argument. The neoclassical movement, aiming to reverse the substantivation of law and to correct lack of due process, functional failures, disparities, and discrimination, faces considerable impediments and may result in counterproductive effects. The article demostrates that (1) societal conditions that caused substantivation hamper reformalization in the political process; organizational and occupational consequences of substantivation also impede (2) political and (3) implementation chances of neoclassical instruments; and (4) impediments to reformalization derive from the method of central guidance used to reestablish sociologically formal rationality.

Giorgio Gagliani	American Journal of Sociology	87	2	1981-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 259-285	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This ariticle concerns the contradictions between the segmentationist approach to the analysis of the labor market and the orthodox radical contention that all or most wage and salary earners belong to the same social class. Labor market segmentation implies priviliges, and these, in turn, provide for class alliances aimed at perpetuating segmentation. Here the crucial class division within the labor market is seen as located along the manual-nonmanual occupational divide. The concepts of equalizing pay differentials, noncompeting groups, and barriers to education are used to show that the nonmanual working class has a strong incentive to form alliance with capital, at least as long as benefits which might derive from different alliances remain unspecified. pg 259-285

Campbell	American Journal of Sociology	83	5	1978-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1204-1223	The University of Chicago Press	fla		While sociologists have recognized the importance of wealth for analysis of political power, they have given little attention to wealth as a measure of economic status. Yet from both a sociological and an economic point of view, wealth is an important determinant of status and life chances, especially at the end of the life cycle. In this paper we discuss the role of net worth as a component of status, and, using data from the National Longitudinal Studies of Labor Force Participation, we estimate a status-attainment model for net worth. Net worth includes savings, home equity, business assets, and real estate holdings. We find that (a) the effects of family background are transmitted via education; (b) the effect of education is asymptotic rather than linear; (c) single and divorced persons possess substantially fewer assets, net of other characteristics, than married persons; and (d) net of all other variables, earnings have a substantial effect on net worth. The effects of family background and socioeconomic attainments on net worth suggest that expanded definitions of status may yield more understanding of the stratification system.

Beginning with the claim that historians of sociology need to look beyond the now-famous ideas that appear in the foreground of the works of the sociological masters, the article examines the neglected idea of habit to document that this concept was long a staple term in the conceptual vocabulary of Western social theorists and that it continued to function as a major background factor in the substantive writings of both Emile Durkheim and Max Weber-a factor that previous scholarship on Durkheim and Weber has almost completely overlooked. It is shown that Durkheim viewed habit not only as a chief determinant of human action in a great variety of areas but also as one of the principal supports for the moral fabric of modern societies. Similarly, habit is found to be significant in Weber's treatment of modern economic and political life, Calvinism and the spirit of capitalism, and the force of traditionalism, which is so central a factor in his framework for comparative-historical analysis. Although the idea of habit was also used extensively in American sociology down to around 1918, in the course of the two decades that followed the concept was purpose fully excised from the conceptual structure of the field. This dramatic change is shown to be a result of the interdisciplinary disputes that surrounded the institutionalization of sociology as an academic.

Oliver, Ralph Prahl	American Journal of Sociology	94	3	1988-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 502-534	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Most analyses of collective action agree that overcoming the freerider problem requires organizing potential contributors, thus making their decisions interdependent. The potential for organizing depends on the social ties in the group, particularly on the overall density or frequency of ties, on the extent to which they are centralized in a few individuals, and on the costs of communicating and coordinating actions through these ties. Mathematical analysis and computer simulations extend a formal microsocial theory of interdependent collective action to treat social networks and organization costs. As expected, the overall density of social ties in a group improves its prospects for collective action. More significant, because less expected, are the findings that show that the centralization of network ties always has a positive effect on collective action and that the negative effect of costs on collective action declines as the group's resource or interest heterogeneity increases. These nonobvious results are due to the powerful effects of selectivity, the organizer's ability to concentrate organizing efforts on those individuals whose potential contributions are the largest.

The data are from an ethnographic field study of homeless street people. "Identity talk" constitutes the primary form of "identity work" by means of which homeless street people construct and negotiate personal identities. Theree generic patterns of identity talk are alborated and illustrated: distancing, embracement, and fictive storytelling. Each form contains several subtypes that vary in usage according to the length of time one has spent on the streets. The paper concludes by discussing the theoretical implications of the findings and suggesting a number of grounded propositions regarding the relationship among role, identity, and self.

Simpson, Mark Evers, Sharon Sandomirsky Poss	American Journal of Sociology	87	6	1982-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1287-1313	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Occupations differ in recruting and retaining labor forces from different cohorts of workers. The measures cohort representation is constructed here to summarize outcomes of the different processes. The paper proposes an occupational competition model consisting of work qualifications, opportunities, rewards, and shelters to account for cohort representation in occupations. United States census data are used to follow four male and four female cohorts in 63 occupations over 20-year periods from 1920-40 through 1950-70. The model predicts recruitment from young cohort better that retention or recruitment from aging cohorts. High work qualifications and wide opportunities favored recruitment. This pattern developed progressively from each cohort to the next for men but appeared only in 1950-70 for women. Contrary to expectations, shelters and high rewards generally did not favor detention. Occupational characteristics rooted directly in the division of labor (qualifications and opportunities) structured the male and female labor markets in similar ways. Characteristics arising from the organization of labor markets within an existing division of labor (shelters and rewards) did not. Male labor markets were relatively structured; female labor markets were amorphous.

The article has six sections: first, a brief survey of the paradigm crisis; second, a development of the concept of an open market in the historiography and sociology of U.S. religion; third, fourth, and fifth, arguments that U.S. religious institutions are constitutively pluralistic, structurally adaptable, and empowering; sixth, a consideration of recent religious individualism in the light of the new paradigm.

Gottdiener	American Journal of Sociology	90	5	1985-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 979-1001	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The analysis of mass culture involves a three-way relationship among cultural objects, their industrial producers, and social groups of users (i.e., the mass audience). Approaches to mass culture neglect the interrelationships between these separate analytical levels. This article brings out his three-way relationship in its full dialectical complexity by applying a semiotic approach to meaning as it is created, communicated, and ideologically managed. The semiotic approach is contrasted with Marxian hegemony theory. Because cultural objects mean different things to different social groups, only semiotic analysis fully specifies the multiplicity of meanings involved in mass culture. The semiotic model views meaning as being exchanged in three separate and qualitatively different stages. Its application results in the proposal for a different kind of textual analysis than that used by contemporary mass culture analysts and in the observation that users of mass culture are more active and creative than previously supposed.

When the reponse is trichotomous, the resulting 3 x 3 x 3 table provides information on heterogeneity of respondents that is detected in different ways by these two kinds of models. Different kinds of heterogeneity, leading to models with different numbers of latent classes or different numbers of latent traits, can be distinguished within both approaches. The two approaches also yield distinctive accounts of change in response probabilities. Data from the American Panel Study illustrate how comparisons between the two kinds of models can be effected.

Alwin	American Journal of Sociology	92	2	1986-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 412-440	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Weber's interpretation of the relationship between religious values and economic rationalism led observers of American society in the past to posit fundamental between-group differences in values to account for differing social and economic orientations of American religious groups, particularly those between Protestants and Catholics. This paper focuses on the relationship between religion and family life giving particular attention to parental values for children and approaches to child rearing. First, the differences in parental values that exist among religioethnic groups in American society and the changing role of religioethnic differences in shaping the child-rearing orientations of parents are examined. Data from Detroit surveys and other sources are used to demonstrate substantial changes in parental values across the past several decades. Also examined are reports of socialization practices, which reflect a high degree of similarity in patterns of behavior among religioethnic groups in modern society. finally, it is shown that expressions of religiosity, such as church attendance, may be more strongly related to some aspects of parental child-rearing orientations than are denominational differences.

In this article I contrast the style and content of the communications directed to close friends and other youths characterized by varying degress of "nearness and remoteness." The handwritten messages found in high school yearbooks are analyzed and used to illustrate some of the distinct features of each type of discourse. This analysis suggests that while intimate relations undoubtedly play a key role in development, adolescents also learn a great deal about themselves and the social world they must navigate throught their interactions with the wider circle of friends.

Golden	American Journal of Sociology	91	2	1985-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 309-331	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Inferences from the historical literature on art are tested in a quantitative comparison of the 125 largest American metropolitan places. Art is measured by the proportion in artistic occupations, whether they involve classical, popular, or commercial art. Economic inequality apparently promotes art, but perhaps no longer primarily through patronage but rather throung the need for affluence to consume art and, particularly, through the diverse demand for art engendered by great differences in economic class. Inequality in education, however, is inversely related to the number of artists, which suggest that art flourishes in cities where most people are well educated and have cultural orientations that, though diverse, compose fairly large taste subcultures. This interpretation is supported by the finding that the existence of large occupational groups in a metropolis is positively related to artistic activities. Inequality in overall social status (SEI) encourages performing but discourages nonperforming arts, probably because performing artists have to be located where affluent audiences can support operas and rock concerts and other performing institutions, whereas othe artists do not.

In this paper we present a model to explain legal handgum demand that emphasizes the level of collective security as a key factor. Time-series data on legal gun demand in Detroit from 1951 to 1977 are consistent with a model in which individuals respond to three determinants of collective security: high violent crime rates, civil disordes, and police strength. The analysis suggests that low confidence in collective security contributes to both the need for and the resistance to gun control policies.

After tests of the secularization thesis, this study's findings indicate that secularization cannot be viewed as a "global phenomenon" of modern societies and suggest that the thesis is derived from generational difference factors and often from domestic sociohistorical events. Bahr's traditional model was partially supported for the United States, where aging has a slight effect on church attendance. A similar trend was found for Holland for religious affiliation. The aging process in Japan has a significant effect on religious belief.

Data from the classic Danish (5 X 5) and British (5 X 5 and 8 X 8) mobility tables are used to illustrate the utility of these methods in comparative analysis. A model designated as a quasi-latent structure is suggested as a plausible rendering of the structure of mobility for each set of data, and this model is used to derive various kinds of substantive inferences.

Positive selective incentives are effective for motivating small numbers of cooperators and generate pressures toward smaller, more "elite" actions, unless the incentives have jointness of supply. Negative selective incentives are effective for motivating unanimous cooperation, but their use is often uneven and cyclical and may generate hostilities which disrupt the cooperation they enforce. Examples of these dynamics are found in many arenas of collective action and social movements.

He expects high-status culture to be useful in class because it is correlated with class, but culture used at work includes both genres related to class (used in domination) and genres unrelated to class (used in coordination). High-status culture is correlated with class but excluded, not used, in the competitive private sector. The most widely useful cultural resource is cultural variety, and social network variety is a better source of cultural variety than is class itself.

Alwin	American Journal of Sociology	90	2	1984-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 359-382	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Using data from sample surveys of the Detroit metropolitan area carried out in 1958, 1971, and 1983, this paper examines patterns of change in parental socialization values over time. There is a clear and consistent increase during this period in the valuation of autonomy for children and a decrease in preferences for obedience. Important differences in the extent of change are observed among Catholics. The sources of these changing characteristics of Detroit families, particularly changing levels of education. Only about 25%-30% of the differential change among religio-ethnic categories can be attributed to such factors. Apart from these considerations, the changing alues of Detroit Catholics are nonetheless significant, and these trends are interpreted as the major source of aggregate social change observed in the Detroit surveys. These results are consistent with other evidence regarding the recent historical movement of Catholics away from what are often considered traditional definitions of family relationships. In addition, the results of this analysis suggest that, although education consistently affects parental values across time, occupation may be declining in its importance as a determinant of those values.

Tolnay	American Journal of Sociology	90	2	1984-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 305-325	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper examines the relationship between family formation and the extent of farm tenancy among blacks in the rural South at the turn of the century. the primary data source is a one-in-750 sample of households taken from the 1900 manuscript census. The findings show that age at marriage for black farmers was significantly negatively related to the proportion of farmers was significantly negatively related to the proportion of farmers who were tenants (chare and cash) in the couple's county of residence. Early marital child-bearing appears to have been unresponsive to the level of farmtenancy, althoug there is indirect evidence that facundity may have varied inversely with tenancy. It is inferred that the wide adoption of the "tenancy sistem" after the Civil War relaxed or prevented cultural restraints on early marriage. Furthermore, it is speculated that the rapid family formation and the family-based mide of production typical of tenancy trapped many black farmers in the stagnant southern agricultural economy.

Kornai's theory of soft budbet constraints, born of the failure of earlier Hungarian reforms, fosters such skepticism-but it assumes as fixed organizational characteristics that in fact vary widely across government jurisdictions. Local governments with smaller industrial bases have clearer financial incentives and constraints, fewer nonfinancial interests in enterprises, and a greater capacity to monitor them. In China's vast public sector, the fastest growth in output and productivity has occurred where government ownership rights are clearest and most easily enforced, which enables officials to manage public industry as a diversified market-oriented firm.

Each political economy uses specific criteria in delineating segments of its economic and work organizations. Furthermore, it is argued that segmentation identification constitutes a critical destination status for individuals engaged in the status-attainment process. A representative sample of the working population in Tianjin, China, is analyzed to show that entrance into the core sectors (state agencies and enterprises), rather that the job per se, constitutes the primary goal of status attainment. Entering into a more desirable work-unit sector in China takes on differential significance and process for males and females. Formales, the direct effect of intergenerational factors (i.e., the effect of father's work-unit sector) is evident. For females, such an effect is only indirect; instead, to a great extent, their status attainment. Also, upward occupational mobility across sectors (from the peripheral to the core) between first and current jobs is substantially greater among male workers (oven 60%) than among female workers (20%). Likewise, males benefit more from social resources (the use of social contacts and their resources) in the job search than females. These findings shed light on the significance of political economy in defining statuses and the viability of the industrialization-attainment thesis. They also point to other oerating processes that transcend the effects of political economy or industrialization. Specifically, these explanatory schemes do not yet prove adequate in accounting for gender differences and the use of social resources in the status-attainment process.

Schutt	American Journal of Sociology	87	5	1982-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1113-1132	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Studies of race bias in the juvenile justice system have yielded contradictory and inconclusive findings. The diversity of findings, though due in part to inadequacies in the methods used in pervious studies, is also attributable in part to the differential possibilities for bias in different settings. This paper develops and tests hypotheses that specify two conditions which affect the likelihood of bias: the characteristics and procedural constraints of processing agencies and the characteristics of their social environments. Long-linear analysis is used, to allow simultaneous control for the influence ofprior record, type of allgation, family type, sex, race, and country in analyzing data from police and court records in a populous eastern state. Consistent with the hypotheses, the findings indicate that racial bias is more apparent in police dispositions than in judicial decisions. In the more urban ofthe two social settings studied, minorities constitute a relatively high proportion of the population; police bias is especially pronounced there. In thesame setting, however, this bias may be compensated for, to some extent, by the courts.

Krosnick	American Journal of Sociology	97	1	1991-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 169-195	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article examines three hypotheses about the relation between age and the stability of sociopolitical attitudes. The hypotheses are (1) the impressionable-year hypothesis, which states that the youngest adults have the least stable attitudes; (2) the aging-stability hypothesis, that attitude stability increases with age; and (3) the hypothesis that symbolic attitudes are more likely to show distinctive life-cycle patterns of attitude stability than less symbolic ones. The hypotheses are tested using nationally representative panel data from the National Election Study (NES). When results are aggregated over 50 different measures of attitudes, they reveal that in general the youngest adults have the lowest levels of attitude stability, although the difference is not significant. Beyond this, the aggregated data show very few systematic age-related differences, and very few life-span differences in attitude stability are related to the nature of the attitude object; that is, symbolic attitudes do not seem to differ systematically from nonsymbolic attitudes in the relationship of age to stability. However, the examination of intracohort patterns of change in stability, using a comparison of stabilities in political party identification across the 1956-1958-1960 and the 1972-1974-1976 NES panel studies, reveals systematic differences that provide clear support for the impressionable-years and aging-stability hypotheses. The decomposition of the stabilities in this measure into components representing "direction" and "intensity" of political partisanship suggests that the intensity component of partisan attitudes declines in stability in old age, whereas the stability of the direction of party loyalties either increases or persists with age. The prevailing model of political socialization-that persons become more "persistent" with age-is reevaluated on the basis of these findings.

A key issue examined is the extent to which the causes and consequences of residential succession account also for the succession of small-busines organizations. Only one type of succession is examined in this paper: the movement of blacks into areas previously occupied by whites. The impact of the transition in residential population on the abandonment of business sites and/or the turnover of business from white to black or Puerto Rican ownership is the particular focus of inquiry. Results of the analysis indicate that the residential succession model fits our data on business succession quite well.

The three quintessential texts are by Thomas More, Friedrich Engels, and Karl Mannheim. They are, respectively, utopia as the criticism of capitalist reality in the name of egalitarian ideas, as the culminating idea of the bourgeoisie's "kingdom of reason," and as a state of mind that can "transcend reality...[and] break the bonds of the existing order." There have been three successive eras of Marxian thought: the era of Marx himself, 1840s-1883; the era of "orthodox" Marxism, from ca. 1880 to ca. 1950; and the era of a thousand Marxisms, 1950s, on. Each Marxian era is correlated with one of the three attitudes toward utopia. Parallel to the three eras of Marxian thought are three eras of social science: the philosophic era, the scientific era, and a new and as yet unnamed era.

Gillis	American Journal of Sociology	92	4	1987-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 788-816	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper extends a power-control theory of common delinquent behavior developed by Hagan, Gillis, and Simpson in 1985. It does so by bringing the class analysis of delinquency into the household, using a new model of class relations based on the relative positions of husbands and wives in the workplace. In patriarchal families, wives have little power relative to husbands, daughters have little freedom relative to sons, and daughters are less delinquent than sons. These differences are diminished in egalitarian families. Power-control theory explains this variation in terms of (1) gender divisions in domestic social control and (2) the resulting attitudes toward risk taking. Power-control theory thereby accoutns for class-specific declines in gender-delinquency relationships that previously required separate deprivation and liberation theories of gender and delinquency. The new theory calls for major changes in the study of class, gender, and delinquency, as well as for a new appreciation of the importance of gender and structures of patriarchi in many other social processes.

Ross, John Mirowsky, Patricia Ulbrich	American Journal of Sociology	89	3	1983-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 670-682	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Among Anglos, married women have higher levels of psychological distress than married men. One explanation is the role-stress theory developed by Gove and his colleagues, which focuses on the stressful aspects of traditional female roles (such as housewife and child rearer) in a society that does not value women's traditional role in the home and does not provide and effective set of institutions for dealing with its demands. The implications of this theory for cross-cultural research are clear yet, to date, untested. One implication is that in societies that place more value on the family and on the woman's role in the home, the psychological distress levels of married men and women will be more similar. This implications of Gove's theory is tested in two cultures, one that places relatively more emphasis on individual achievement outside the home (Anglo culture) and one that places relatively more emphasis on the family and home (Mexican culture). As expected, the gap in psychological distress levels between marreid men and women is found to be much smaller in Mexican culture than in Anglo culture. However, the explanations for this finding are not as clear-cut as the role-stress argument imply.

Organizational niches characterize intrapopulation variation in productive capacities and resource requirements and are operationalized for a population of day care centers (DCCs) based on the ages of children they are licensed to enroll. The authors find competitive effects of overlap density, the aggregate overlap of a DCC's organizational niche with those of all others, and mutualistic effects of nonoverlap density, the aggregate nonoverlap, which are strongest among neighboring DCCs. The authors discuss the implications of their findings for studying organizational population dynamics.

Craig Jenkins	American Journal of Sociology	88	3	1982-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 487-514	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Recent analyses of the sources of 20th-century peasant rebellions have centered on two basic theories: a structural theory of class relations that points to the greater political volatility of smallholder tenancy and a historical theory pointing to the strength of traditional village institutions in the midst of the increasing economic insecurity of the peasantry brought about by the expansion of the market economy; increased exactions by landowners and the state, and the pressure of rapid population growth. These theories are evaluated against the experience of the large-scale rebellions that occurred throughout the Russian Empire in 1905-7. Although the historical record provides preliminary support for both theories, regression analysis of the links between provincial socioeconomic patterns and the incidence of the rebellions disconfirms the structural theory and corroborates the basic propositions of the historical theory. Peasants rebel because of threats to their access to an economic subsistence, not because of the particular form of class relations in which they are enmeshed.

The evidence does not support earlier predictions of widespread apostasy and conversions to Catholicism, "high-status" Protestant denominations, and black nationalist sects and cults. Blacks as a whole report a continued high level of church attendance and confidence in the clergy, although, for reasons which are not clear, there has been a steep decline in the number of black clergymen. Recent evidence lends little support to the traditional image of black religion (reported by Dollard, among others) as unusually otherworldly and nonascetic.

This study of elderly persons in New Haven, Connecticut, examines the prospective relationship between religious involvement and several aspects of health status. Results show significant protective effects of public religious in volvement against disability among men and women and of private religious involvement against depression among recently disabled men over a three-year period. Religious group membership also protected Christians and Jews against mortality in the month before their respective religious holidays during a six-year period. The article concludes that religious involvement exerts a strong positive effect on the health of the elderly; that this effect varies by religious group and by sex; that the health behaviors, social contacts, and optimistic attitudes of religious group members may explain part but not all of this association; and that several aspects of religious experience, such as participation in ritual and religion's provision of meaning play a role.

These studies have focused on the coefficient for foreign capital stock, controlling for "flow" (new investment), and-defying logic-have inferred that a negative coefficient for stock reflects "dependency effects" that retard economic growth. Since capital stock is the denominator for investment rate, the greater the stock, the lower the investment rate, for a given level of new investment. Hence the negative coefficient for capital stock found in dependency studies indicates a beneficial investment effect, not a harmful effect. This point is demonstrated by reanalysis of the data used in dependency studies. In these data, foreign investment spurs growth. Earlier analysts have concluded otherwise only because their conclusions have belied their findings.

Some scholars have argued that the affiliates of the various Protestant denominations are becoming more and more alike in their socioeconomic and demographic characteristics and in religious behavior and orientations. Hence, they argue, denominational affiliation has little independent impact on either religious or secular behavior. Others have suggested that denominational affiliations continue to be important influences on individual behavior. In this paper we analyze data from a national survey of American Jews wich show that denominational differences are substantial and more influential within this highly educated and acculturated minority than they have commontly been assumed to be. These findings suggest that recent research may have underestimated the potential importance of contemporary denominational differentiation for American religious life.

Using data from public school students in Louisville, Kentucky, and their mothers, we examine the role of maternal self-direction/conformity values in transmiting the effects of parental social position on a variety of schooling variables.Our results replicate the persistent relationship between father's occupational position and parental values (measured here as maternal values), and they indicate limited support for the sensitivity of adolescent school experiences to parental values for white (but not black) students.

Our proposed theoretical explanation for these phenomena links attractiveness effects to other cases of status generalization such as those produced by race or sex. Many effects of attractiveness can be explained by viewing it as a status characteristic and applying a theory of status charactersitics and expectation states proposed and elaborated by Joseph Berger and others. A test of the proposed explanation shows that (1) attractiveness produces predicted differences in both general and specific expectations; (2) attractiveness effects can be modified in combination with additional status characteristics; and (3) neither of the two above results is affected by sex of stimulus individuals or respondents, a differentiation of this explanation from one that relies on sexual or romatinc appeal.

These economic gaps cannot be explained by differences in age and education between the birthplace groups. Currently the two main interpretations are: (1) a highly selective migration of blacks from the South involving more than age and education and/or (2) the existence of some fundamental differences between the two birthplace groups. The evidence gathered indicates that a substantial part of the selective migration process is not really taken into account when the controls normally available for age, sex, and education are applied. Further, it indicates that return migration of southern-born blacks is both numerically sizable and largely selective of blacks who did not fare well in the North. Hence, there are important selective processes involved in determining which southern blacks remain in the North as well as in determining their initial migration from the South. Based on certain assumptions about regional differences in the opportunity structure for education, ridits are used in lieu of actual attainment to control for education's influence on North-South differences in income. Whem selective migration is also taken into account, the results are radically different such that the southern income advantage disappears completely. The usual procedures for dealing with educational differences can generate totally misleading results. The approach to educational attainment used here may be applied to a wide variety of empirical questions involving education and similar types of variables.

Through a reconstruction and reanalysis of some of the data presented I found that the verbal model proposed in that work concerning the interrelationships and relative importance of several variables was in error. An alternative model fits the data much better and supports conclusions in marked contrast to those stated. Contrary to the model suggested in Delinquency in a Birth Cohort, the relation between achievement level and delinquency status is not a spurious one due to a common association with race. Moreover, achievement appears to be at least as strongly related to delinquency status as are race and social class.

In contrast, Adam Smith. David Hume, and others of the 18-century Scottish Enlightenment propose that commercial society sharply distinguishes self-interested from sympathetic relations and is therefore necessary for the spread of personal relations based on sympathy and sentiment. If this is correct, commercial society promotes rather than discourages personal relations that are normatively free of instrumental and calculative orientations. Taking friendship as prototyical os such relations, this essay considers the contributions of the Scottish Enlightenment to the study of personal relations in historical and modern times.

Craig Jenkins	American Journal of Sociology	99	1	1993-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 126-163	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Why has postcolonial Africa been so vulnerable to military coups? Examination of the different types of military interventions (plots, attempts, and successful seizures) and comparison of the immediate independence period with the 1970s show the major sources of coups to be ethnic antagonisms stemming from cultural plurality and political competition, and the presence of strong militaries with factionalized officer corps. There is no evidence for a political "overload" due to rising mass participation, but politically factionalized regimes were more vulnerable to coups. During the 1970s, export dependence created political turmoil, which led to plotting, but foreign capital penetration, by strengthening states, deterred coups. Military coups are largely driven by elite rivalries inside the military and the civilian government. Stable civilian rule would require and elite pact to regulate political competition within multiethnic states.

Clausen	American Journal of Sociology	96	4	1991-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 805-842	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The life course is shaped by the interaction of cultural and social structural features with physical and psychological attributes of the individual and by the commitments and purposive efforts of the individual. In modern society, rationality and functionality have replaced tradition as determinants of individual choices in the transition to adulthood. Adolescent competence should lead to thinking through career and marital choices and inhibiting tendencies to make unwise choices. Therefore, competent adolescents should have more stable careers and marriages, and, because they will more often be rewarded for their attributes than will less competent ones, they should experience less personality change over the adult years. These hypotheses are largely confirmed with data from a longitudinal cohort studied for more than 50 years.

Two studies examinig this relationship are compared-one, a sample of children aged 8-18; the other, a sample of adults aged 18-65. The results indicate virtually no association for younger children, a modest association for adolescents, and a moderate association for adults. Four principles of self-esteem development are advanced to account for these conditional relations-social comparison processes, reflected appraisals, self-perception theory, and psychological centrality. It is suggested that these principles apply equally to adults and children and that the identical principles help to explain why social class should have different effects on the self-esteem of children and adults.

This article shows that it is also grounded in a contradictory act: the demonstration of the compatibility between scientific and nonscientific interests. Between 1955 and 1975, American political protest forced scientists to find ways to reconcile these contradictions. One way in which this reconciliation was accomplished was through the formation of public interest science organizations, which permitted the preservation of organizational representations of pure, unified science, while simultaneously assuming responsibilities to serve the public good.

The results indicate that gender powerfully influenced the dynamics of recruitment to the project, experiences during the summer, the long-term political effects that followed from participation in the campaign, and the subjects' owm assessment of the projects' impact on their lives. Interestingly, the behavioral effects of the project are greatest for the male volunteers. But it is the female volunteers who attribute the greatest personal significance to the project. It is suggested that this seeming paradox can be explained by two factors: (1) the more extensive histories of activism the female volunteers brought to the project and (2) the significance assigned to the project in feminist accounts of the origins of the women's liberation movement.

Although the theory has been debated for decades, some of the propositions have not been examined previously. Income and prestige were chosen as the occupational rewards. Positional characteristics presumed to effect occupational rewards were required talent (a job's functional complexity), disagreeability (e.g., physical labor), training, and perceived functional importance. In general, the data supported Davis and Moore's basic propositions. The theory was extended by considering some implied interactions and offering a tentative causal model for positional determinants. The model included a reciprocal relationship between income and prestige.

It is argued that the ascribed nature of social class among young adolescents makes it a weak determinat of their self-esteem, but that with increasing age socioeconomic position becomes more meaningful and thus more consequential for self-esteem.Data are presented which reveal a stronger association between social class and self-esteem among eighth graders than among fifth graders. One salient characteristic, academic skills, is found to be a strong predictor of early adolescent self-attitudes. Last, levels of self-esteem increase consistently from the fifth to the eighth grade, indicating a developmental trend toward greater self-acceptance.

Major attention is given to the occurrence of social movements in corporate hierarchical forms, although the approach is applicable also to social movement phenomena in federated and in voluntary associatins. A number of illustrative hypotheses are given.

A review of recent research shows that Chinese society and other similar societies follow rules that deviate from those of the West. In such societies, norms of reciprocity (bao) are intense, but these norms are heavily shaped by the hierarchically structured network of social relations (guanxi) in which people are embedded, by the public nature of obligations, and by the long time period over which obligations are incurred through a self-conscious manipulation of face and related symbols. These special cultural symbols, as well as the historical monopoly of valuable resources by powerful leaders, help explain he origin of these patterns. There are several forces leading to change but also some sources of continuity, which help maintain these patterns regardless of political and economic context.

Presser, Wendy Baldwin	American Journal of Sociology	85	5	1980-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1202-1213	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This study examines the extent to which the unavailability of satisfactory child care is a constrait on employment for mothers with children under five years of age. It also explores some of the social and demographic correlates of constrait and the role child care plays in the relationship between labor-force participation and fertility. The analysis is based on data from the June 1977 Current Population Survey for the United States. A substantial minority of mothers with young children, both nonemployed and employed, feel that if child care were available at reasonable cost, they would seek employment or work more hours. Child-care constrait seems to be most prevalent among mothers who are young, black, single, with low education and with little income. The relatively low fertility expectations among those prevented from working by the unavailability of child care suggests that not just current employment, but also the intention of desire to work, is related to fertility behavior. The differential in births expected by labor-force status is minimized by the inclusion of "constrainess" with the nonemployed.

Both strategies employ as a descriptive tool the ordinary multiple regression algorithms; the crucial difference between the two is that the first, ordinal strategy, uses the matrix of Kendall's 's as the building block of multivariate analysis, while the second, parametric strategy, uses the matrix of Pearson's 's. These two strategies are evaluated and constrasted in terms of their usefulness in answering basic research questions that arise in multivariate analysis. One overriding conclusion is that, contrary to the claims of its proponents, the ordinal strategy is no better than the parametric strategy at meeting some of the basic requirements of multivariate analysis. It is argued that parametric strategy, when accompanied by careful evaluation of the validity of the implict quantification of ordinal variables, is more amenable to one of the goals of scientific research: successive approximation and refinement.

The hypothesis differs from traditional neo-Marxist accounts of state reliance on science by (1) suggesting that reliance on science will probably not legitimate state action with overt class content and (2) arguing that, although functional adjustments are not automatic, science's facilitation of politicization and "legitimation crisis" in the short term can provide a mechanism through which dysfunctional state reliance on science is restricted or supressed. Whereas National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) economists promoted radical possibilities in a statute undermining market determination of wages and market ideology by explicitly promoting the class organization of labor, Social Security Board (SSB) economists helped institutionalize market-reinforcing social security through, for example, contributory social insurance and wage-related benefits. Whereas the convergence of science and market logic promoted consensus around conservative social insurance, NLRB reliance on economists promoting potentially nonreproductive policies stimulated class conflict. At the SSB, functional science was institutionalized; at the NLRB, dysfunctional science was eliminated.

Rossi	American Journal of Sociology	84	3	1978-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 541-564	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Previous traditions of distributive-justice research assume the existence of a normative structure for making judgments about fairness of allocations of social goods, such as earnings. Does a consensual normative framework for judging the fairness of distributions of earnings exist in the U.S. population? What principles underlie popular judgments concerning earnings distributions? Data indicate both that judgments of earnings fairness are not idiosyncratic and that they involve individual and group differences related to considerations of merit and need. Some tolerance for variation in earnings among house-holds is noted, and the same factors accounting for earnings-fairness judgments justify earnings considered fair. Considerable agreement exists concerning what principles are relevant to earnings-fairness judgments, while disagreement concerning how to apply these standards in practice is admitted. Apparently the standards for earnings judgments derive both from conceptions of the empirical distribution of earnings and from underlying values concerning what is fair and just.

Lee Hamilton, Steve Rytina	American Journal of Sociology	85	5	1980-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1117-1144	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Social consensus on norms of justice has long been of concern to sociologist. The present paper presents a model of justice norms as congnitions and tests the degree of cognitive consensus on the norm of just deserts (i.e., "letting the punishment fit the crime"). It is argued that consensus on justice norms should be tested using a combination of within-respondent and between-respondent techniques. Such tests can (1) simultaneously reveal the presence of consensus on the justice principle involved and on the evaluation of the specific social stimuli presented, (2) facilitate demographic comparisons on adhering to principle or agreeing on facts, and (3) reveal conflicts between these two versions of consensus. For testing the norm of just deserts, ratio scale measures of crime seriousness and punishment severity were employed, and a formula derived from both equity theory and psychophysics was utilized in model fitting. Results from a sample survey indicated dramatically strong use of the principle of just deserts by members of the public but less adherence to just deserts by demographically disadvantaged (low-income or black) respondents. A path model of the relation between aggregate and individual scores further demonstrated a fundamental tension between the two versions of normative consensus, in that the more respondents used the principle the more systematically they deviated from the group average response. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of both the substantive findings and the new methodologies employed for understanding normative consensus and the assessment of justice norms.

This analysis is linked to the theory on the "new class," reconceptualized as those in the new middle class who try to defend their relative autonomy against the encroachment of the "technocrats." The analysis shows that, although the Dutch new social movements are supported by broad segments of the population, their inner circles are predominantly constituted by segments of the reconceptualized new class: the young specialists in social and cultural services, and some of the yound administrative specialists in public service. In addition, the analysis documents the liberalizing effect of education for the younger cohorts and suggests a profound change of values in the postwar period.

Kohn, Carmi Schooler	American Journal of Sociology	84	1	1978-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 24-52	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Our previous research, based on cross-sectional data, provided prima facie evidence of a reciprocal relationship between the substantive complesity of men's work and their intellectual flexibility. The present study employs longitudinal data to make a more definitive assessment. Using maximum-likelihood confirmatory factor analysis to separate measurement error from real change, it develops measurement models for both substantive complexity and intellectual flexibility. These models whos that, over a 10-year time span, the "stability" of both variables, shorn of measurment error, is high, that of intellectual flexibility specially so. Nevertheless, a structural equation causal analysis demonstrates that the effect of the substantive complexity of work on intellectual flexibility is real and remarkably strong-on the order of one-fourth is great as the effect of men's earlier levels of intellectual flexibility on their present intellectual flexibility. The reciprocal effect of intellectual flexibility on substantive complexity is even more pronounced. This effect, however, is not contemporaneous but, rather, a lagged effect occurring more gradually over time.

Emerson	American Journal of Sociology	87	1	1981-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1-22	The University of Chicago Press	fla		In a variety of social control settings, the use of extreme sanctions is held to be appropriate only as a last resort. This paper examines the nature, occasions, and accomplishment of such last-resort responses. Last resorts characteristically claim that there is no alternative but to invoke some dubiously valued sanction, a claim advanced against the backdrop of the "normal remedies" customarily used in a particular setting. Requested last resorts are justified by showing either that all such normal remedies are specifically inappropriate or that they have failed to contain the trouble. The conditions governing the latter procedure for justifying the turn to last-resort sanctions are analyzed in detail.

Miller McPherson, Lynn Smith-Lovin	American Journal of Sociology	87	4	1982-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 883-904	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper explores some network consequences of dramatic differences between men and women in the typical size of the voluntary organizations they belong to.These size differences are greatest in organizations that are most economically oriented. Furthermore, the differences are remarkably consistent across social categories; men tend to belong to larger organizations when compared with women in similar categories, whether of work status, age, education, or marital status. Men are located in core organizations which are large and related to economic institutions, while women are located in peripheral organizations whichare smaller and more focused on domestic or community affairs. Even though men and women have almost exactly the same number of memberships on the average, thedramatic differences in the sizes and types of their organizations expose men tomany more potential contacts and other resources than women.

Condran	American Journal of Sociology	94	1	1988-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 110-129	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The association between the sex of children and their parents' risk of marital disruption is examined using the June 1980 Current Population Survey. The finding is that sons reduce the risk of marital disruption by 9% more than do daughters. This difference holds across marriage cohorts, racial groups, and categories of mother's education. A compelling explanation for these findings, supported by data from the National Survey of Children, stresses a father's greater role in raising sons than daughters and his consequently greater involvement in the family. Children provide a new basis for marital cohesion, one that rests on attachments and obligations to children. For fathers, the obligations and attachments are greater if they have sons.

Devereaux Jennings	American Journal of Sociology	92	2	1986-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 350-383	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper charts the transformation of the employment relationship in different industries during the second quarter of this century and is based on a representative sampling of U.S. business organizations. The first section documents changes in the control systems that prevailed in U.S. industries between the Depression and the end of World War II. The descriptive analyses generally corroborate portraits that have recently been provided by neo-Marxists of how and where technical and bureaucratic controls evolved. The second section sketches and explanation for the rapid diffusion of bureaucratic controls that apparently occurred between 1939 and 1946. It examines the role of three key constituencies in shaping modern system of work force control: labor unions, personnel professionals, and the state. In particular, the analyses underscore the large role of government intervention in manpower activities during World War II in bureaucratizing employment. This effect of the state blurs the distinction between "efficiency" and "control" explanations of bureaucratic controls and internal labor markets, calling attention to institutional sources of change in organizations' employment structures. The concluding section highlights the implications of the findings for efforts to understand the employment relationship.

Bosk	American Journal of Sociology	94	1	1988-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 53-78	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper develops a model of the process through which social problems rise and fall. Treating public attention as a scarce resource, the model emphasizes competition and selection in the media and other arenas of public discourse. Linkages among public arenas produce feedback that drives the growth of social problems. Growth is constrained by the finite "carrying capacities" of public arenas, by competition, and by the need for sustained drama. The tension between the constraints and forces for growth produces successive waves of problem definitions, as problems and those who promote them compete to enter and to remain on the public agenda. Suggestions for empirical tests of the model are specified.

It predicts precisely and unambiguously the kind of injustice (i.e., underreward or overreward) and the degree of injustice associated with given departures from perfect justice. The new justice evaluation function was inducted from extensive analyses of survey data on the perceived justice or injustice of earnings. It is directly generalizable to cover all socially distributed goods, and hence I propose it as a candidate for a universal Law of Justice Evaluation in distributional matters. Finally, I suggest that such a Law of Justice Evaluation performs one of the three tasks essential to a scientific theory of distributive justice.

O'Connell	American Journal of Sociology	93	5	1988-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1116-1152	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Previous studies have found that rural areas experienced substantial growth in public school enrollments around the turn of the century. Is this finding based on a narrow definition of schooling patterns? The analysis of state-level patterns for 1890-1940 shows that urban industrialism, religion, and race had varying effects across different dimensions of schooling, including public enrollment and attendance rates, and enrollments in private versus public schools and for younger versus older children. In contrast to prior interpretations, this article argues that the diversity of effects can be explained in terms of subpopulation differences in the need for children's labor contributions in the family economy, the availability of "work" (both paid and unpaid), and its compatibility (on a part-year or part-day basis) with schooling.

Weakliem	American Journal of Sociology	96	6	1991-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1327-1361	The University of Chicago Press	fla		It has recently been argued that class divisions in politics are being altered by the emergence of conflicts over nonmaterial issues. Since the main support for the new ("postmaterialist") left is in the midle class, segments of the middle class are attracted to the left, while more traditionalist working-class voters move to the right. This paper uses long-linear association models to test this argument, examining occupation and party choice in France, Italy, and the Netherlands from 1973 to 1985. While there is evidence of a post materialist dimension, its importance is generally stable across time and cohorts. The conclusions still hold when education is taken into account. Recent political developments are better understood as a general shift in attitudes among all classes than as a change in the relative importance of different class divisions.

Estes	American Journal of Sociology	97	4	1992-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 945-969	The University of Chicago Press	fla		In this article, data on home health agencies reveal surprisingly few differences between organizations of different tax status (nonprofit vs. forprofit). These findings direclty contradict economic theories of nonprofit organization, as well as third-party government theory from political science. Since ecological theory in sociology proposes a useful explanation for organizational similartities, the authors search for differences between nonprofit and forprofit organizations among generalists and specialists. They find that specialists are quite similar, regardless of tax status, but generalists are different, a disparity that seems to contradict ecological analysis. Since institutional theory also explains isomorphism, the authors search for differences between organizations that do and do not belong to chains. Chains are more similar than nonchains. The discussion of the results centers on changes in the institutional context of home health care over the last decade, especially cascade effects of prospective payment schemes and the advent of new organizational forms. The authors conclude that the idea of accommodative isomorphism helps account for similarities among nonprofit and forprofit chains.

The latter model can be used to analyze adaptive strategies groups resort to in competitive situations, such as occur during modernization. At one extreme, groups may maximize their relative population size and use political means to claim and hold a share of a society's resources. This strategy is well known, and several theorists emphasize the advantages of large relative size in ethnic group relations. This paper focuses on the strategy at the other end of the continuum. Bioecologists use the term "r-strategists" to refer to especies which maximize their ability to discover ephemeral resources, exploit them quickly, and then disperse in search of new resources. Gypsies and Travellers in modern states are discussed as examples of ethnic r-strategists. These groups are seen to maximize their ability to discover and exploit resources which are irregular in space and time and subject to numerous and varying local constraints through their nomadism and flexible organization. The analysis illustrates the environmental conditions under which r-selection occurs among ethnic groups and identifies some of the characteristics of these groups which may contribute to their success.

Mare	American Journal of Sociology	94	5	1989-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1146-1183	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article examines the effects of academic tracking in secondary schools on educational stratification and considers how that tracking may affect levels and dispersions of academic achievement and high school graduation rates among social groups. Data from the High School and Beyond survey of students who were sophomores in 1980 show that placement in the college track substantially benefits growth in mathematics achievement and the probability of high school graduation, even when measured and unmeasured sources of nonrandom assignment to tracks are taken into account. Track assignment reinforces preexisting inequalities in achievement among students from different socioeconomic backgrounds. However, track assignment and differential achievement in tracks partially compensate blacks and girls for their initial disadvantages and makes racial and sexual inequalities smaller than they may have otherwise been. The article provides qualified support for the view that students are assigned to the tracks that provide the greatest reward to their measured background characteristics.

The more important parts of the analysis developed from this theory can be carried out by elementary methods and therefore require no great mathematical or statistical sophistication. In several illustrative data sets, the observed changes are adequately accounted for with a model allowing no causal relationship between the two latent variables or their observable indicators. In other examples, a model of asymmetric causation is plausible; in still others, the situation is so complex that a convincing causal interpretation, excluding rival interpretations, is not available. The basic form of the latent-trait model can be modified to include parameters pertaining to association of the observed indicators. This modification is especially appropriate when the two variables arise from parallel observations on the memebers of dyads rather than from observations on two distict items (attitudes, actions) pertaining to individual respondent. Limitations of the illustrative analyses reported here are, for the most part, intrinsic to the 16-fold table itself, whatever the analytical strategy, or are shared with other forms of survey analysis. The latent-trait approach, however, may make such limitations easier to see.

But the effect of status does not account for all of the association between occupational origins and destinations. The amount of autonomy accorded to workers and the degree of specialization in the training required of them are also important for mobility. Men whose fathers were entrepreneurs or were employed in other positions that require little supervision are more likely than men whose fathers were closely supervised to enter occupations that offer at least some degree of on-the-job autonomy. Autonomy and training are especially important for immobility. Men whose fathers were autonomous or specially trained are more likely than other men to be immobile. A model incorporating the effects of socioeconomic status, on-the-job autonomy, and specialized training is fitted to the 1962 and 1973 Occupational Changes in a Generation data. The models fits the data well with few parameters. Subpopulations defined by race, age, and education are also analyzed. The analysis provides new insight into the weakening of the association between origins and destinations between 1962 and 1973, the convergence of black and white mobility patterns, and the role of education as an intervening variable in the mobility process.

It may signal aggresive or dominating intent, as in a staredown, or it may convey an impression of close bonding, intimacy, or a request for aid, depending on how actors define the situation. Some theories of nonverbal communication assume that mutual gaze is physiologically arousing and that this arousal accounts in part for the efficacy of eye contact as a communication channel. The first experiment reported here shows that mutual gaze does indeed cause more physiological arousal than control conditions of nonmutual gaze. The second experiment demonstrates that an actor can communicate with another person by gazing in such a manner that he can manipulate that person's physiology. A third experiment demonstrates that a subject's response to a mutual gaze is a good predictor of his or her degree of influence (dominance) in subsequent social interaction. These results emphasize the rapid emergence of status differentiation in face-to-face interaction between strangers.

Using Canadian data, we find that (1) voting and campaing activity are qualitatively different forms of activity that need to be examined separately, and (2) the Michigan model, with its emphasis on individual interests and beliefs as the primary determinatn of political activities, applies to voting behavior but not to campaing activity. A "public-arena" model that distinguishes whether an individual was contacted to participate in campaign activities is suggested in its place. Results indicate hta, net of all else, being recruited to participate in campaing activity by 50%. Analyses suggest that an explanation of who is likely to be recruited should include both individual status and social network characteristics. Implications of the findings for a democratic polity are noted.

Pampel, Sookja Park	American Journal of Sociology	91	4	1986-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 932-955	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Despite the importance of labor force status to the well-being of older women in developing and developed nations, retirement of females has not been studied cross-nationally. This article first presents hypotheses concerning the effects of (1) industrial development, (2) social security growth, (3) sex stratification, and (4) family structure and fertility on cross-national patterns of female retirement. It then argues that industrial development interacts with the variables specified by the other hypotheses in determining female retirement, Longitudinal, aggregate data for 93 nations in 1960, 1965, and 1970 are used to calculate rates of withdrawal of females from the labor force during old age and to test the arguments. The results show substantial female retirement that varies systematically with the economic and social characteristics of the nations studied. As predicted, the effects of pensions, family size, and sexual equality on female retirement increase with the level of industrial development. This supports the interpretation that industrial work conditions combine with lowered family duties and greater sexual equality to increase female retirement. Overall, all the hypotheses are supported, but it is necessary to consider the different contexts in which they apply.

As expected, the zero-order correlation between years to schooling and Republican party preference was found to be positive. However, controling for inherited partisan loyalties, class origins, and socioeconomic attainment, the positive correlation disappeared and, at least for males, the direct effect of higher education on being Republican was found to be negative, as those who view college as a socializing agent would have predicted. The implications of these findings for the apparent decline and future of class-based politics, as the proportion of college-educated voters continues to increase over the next several decades, are briefly discussed.

Carruthers, Yvonne Zylan	American Journal of Sociology	98	2	1992-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 308-339	The University of Chicago Press	fla		During the Depression, the Townsend movement enjoyed varied success in seeking pensions for the aged. Social-movement models predict that success depends on the mobilization of resources or on collective action. Other theories predict that economic or political conditions cause the emergence of movements and changes in public spending. The political mediation model used here holds that, to succeed, a movement must reinforce political action with strong organization of members under favorable political conditions. This article defines "success" and employs various analytical and empirical strategies, including qualitative comparative analysis on state level data, to appraise the models. Although each perspective has some support, the political mediation model offers the best explanation of the patterns of successes. The state and the political party system determine whether mobilization and action benefit a constituency and win acceptance for a movement organization.

The comparative interest focused on two features: (1) the presumed sharper discontinuity of French class structure compared with the more diffuse American system; and (2) the supposed differences in mobility attitudes in the two countries. Structure and attitudes are commonly taken as conditioners of the mobility experience, moderating or heightening its hypothesized effects on (for example) feelings of social isolation, ethnic prejudice, sense of relative deprivation, and political radicalism or conservatism. The analysis, however, argues strongly in support of French-American similarity rather than difference, in two major respects: (1) mobility attitudes showed the same basic structure and correlation pattern; and (2) as expected, the effects which can be attributed to objective mobility were highly limited in both countries.

We test the convergence hypothesis by examining the trend in the earnings gap between workers living in the South and North (the non-South) of the United States from 1960 to 1976. The results show some convergence for advantaged workers, blue collar workers, and workers with lower educational attainment. Most of the earnings gap between workers in the North and South cannot be explained by differences in the industrial, occupational, or educational composition of the work force.

Kelly	American Journal of Sociology	82	1	1976-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 131-162	The University of Chicago Press	fla		We use a unique source of data on each of over 6,000 strikes (many of them violent) occurring in Italy from 1878 to 1903 to address two major issues in the study of collective violence: the determinants of violence (the conditions under which conflicts become violent) and its consequences (whether violence promotes successful collective action). We also suggest strategic advantages of individual event data over the aggregate analyses which dominate empirical studies of these issues. Our results indicate that work stoppages are more likely to become violent when they are large in size and long in duration and occur over multiple issues; some of our negative findings on other issue dimensions challege long-standing assumptions in conflict theory. We then analyze the relationship between violence and strike outcomes and find that, net of other determinants, violent strikes are less likely to end in success for workers.

Sutton	American Journal of Sociology	88	5	1983-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 915-947	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper presents an analysis of the development of state juvenile codes in the United States in the 19th century. The central phenomenon examined is the legal differentiation of adults and children through the creation of unique deviant statuses for children and the denial of procedural rights as a requirement for their incarceation. A variant of legal evolution theory, based on a model suggested by Turner, is used to explore the determinants of legal differentiation in this case. Documentary sources and quantitative data from state juvenile codes and census records are used to show, first, that the establishment of juvenile reformatories was a necessary precondition for changes in the legal status of children and, second, that the diffusion of reformatories is explainable, not by modernization in general but rather by a combination of semi-independent socioecomonic, cultural, and political factors.

This pattern has consequences which should be important to sociologists of culture since collection keeps pieces of material culture in the environment longer, perhaps to be used as design precedents for future objects.

Rosenbaum	American Journal of Sociology	85	1	1979-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 21-48	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This study analyzes the age distribution of upward mobility in a large corporation, examining changes in the age-promotion relationship for different levels in the organizational hierarchly, for different kinds of employess, and across time periods of increasing and creasing organizational growth. Analyzing the corporation's complete personnel records over three times periods, this paper test a precipitous-decline hypothesis derived from the organizational careers literature, an exponential-decline hypothesis derived from the Markov literature on career mobility, and an increase-decrease hipothesis derived from the economic literature on life-cycle earnings patterns. Analysis finds partial support for each hypothesis for different groups of employees. It also finds remarkable stability in these patterns across periods, particularly for the most and least favored groups; the changes which do occur tend to "spillover" to specific stadby age-education groups. The age-promotion curves and the spillover patterns are explained in terms of a new efficiency-motivation model of organizational mobility. Finally, analysis indicates that these age effects seem to persist after controlling for years of service. The implications of these findings for organizational selection systems and for career and life-cycle phenomena are considered.

A New Measure of Labor-Market Success	Christopher Jencks, Lauri Perman, Lee Rainwater	American Journal of Sociology	93	6	1988-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1322-1357	The University of Chicago Press	fla		No currently available index allows investigators to estimate the overall desirabitlity of specific jobs. With data collected in the 1980 Survey of Job Charactersitics, an index of job desirability (IJD) can be constructed to fill this gap. The IJD incorporates 13 nonmonetary job characteristics along with measures of earnings and weights all job characteristics according to their effects on workers' judgments about how "good" their current jobs are compared with an average job. While earnings are the most important single determinant of a job's desirability, the 13 nonmonetary job characteristics together are twice as important as earnings. Unlike occupational status and earnings, the proposed index explains almost the entire effect of race, sex, educational attainment, and experience on job ratings. It also explains almost all the variation in job ratings provided by workers in different occupations. Furthermore, taking account of nonmonetary job characteristics more than doubles the estimated level of labor-market inequality. White skin, male gender, favorable social origins, high educational attainment, and extensive labor-market experience are also worth two to five times.

Parents' education, main earner's occupation, and geographical origin contributed to these inequalities. Gender preferences for men were removed, and for some transitions reversed. Although secondary education grew rapidly, higher education failed to keep pace. This disparity led to a university-level enrollment squeeze, and the resulting bottleneck hurt disadvantaged classes more than advantaged ones. In turn the effect of social origins on entering university increased after 1965. The upshot was no net change in the origin-based differences in likelihood of attaining a VUZ degree across three postwar cohorts.

Levinger	American Journal of Sociology	82	1	1976-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 86-110	The University of Chicago Press	fla		A baseline model is developed to show the conduciveness of population size to the density of interaction in human aggregates. This model permits deduction and, therefore, explanation of a wide variety of social phenomena. It explains the positive relation between rates of crimes of violence and city size indicated by Webb's (1972) data. And it provides a formal rationale for Kasarda's (1974) hypothesis relating size and communication in macrostructures, as well as an alternative to some aspects of the theory formulated by Hamblin, Jacobsen, and Miller (1973). Our model accounts for the "transitory" and "superficial" nature of urban social relations commented upon by Simmel (1903), Wirth (1938), and Milgram (1970) and explains why inhabitants of large cities are unlikely to intervene in crises. In conjunction with considerations noted by Mayhew et al. (1972), the model explains why role strain may be expected to increase with organizational size, as illustrated in Snoek's (1966) national study. The wide variety of phenomena illuminated by this model suggests that it is a serious mistake to view the effects of population size as "obvious." Rather, taking population size explicity into account should enhance the explanatory power of sociological theories.

This paper, in contrast, considers how Congress came to agree on the content of today's EEO law, how support for EEO legislation increased from the early 1940s to the early 1970s, and why action on EEO subsequently ceased. The data show that although American society changed a great deal during these years, the congressional debate on EEO was organized around ideas proposed in the 1940s. The growth of support for EEO legislation was steady and gradual over the entire period, and congressional action ceased after 1972 because the original agenda had been completed. The implications of the findings for the causal analysis of congressional action are considered.

Appropriate methods for the causal analysis of corresponding kinds of systems of qualitative variables have been introduced more recently, and they provide useful tools for the research worker who may be concerned with the study of qualitative variable. In order to facilitate the application of these more recently developed to the causal analysis of qualitative variables, further exposition of these methods is presented in this note. One of the contributions of this additional exposition is the correction of incorrect statements on this topic by H. T. Reynolds.

Richtand	American Journal of Sociology	90	1	1984-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 97-124	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper examines the conditions under which work for the household is performed, comparing these conditions and their effects with those of paid employment. Although there are some significant differences, the working conditions of housework do not differ greatly from those of paid employment. There are, however, as expected, marked sex differences in spheres of responsibility and activity. Wives are responsible for and actually do a vastly wider range of household tasks than husbands. In terms of its effects, housework has decided psychological consequences for women whether or not they are employed outside the home. Men are less affected by housework than women and in different ways. Employed women react similarly to similar housework and paidwork conditions; this is not the case for men. The pattern of findings is congruent with the hypothesis that responses to household labor, as to paid employment, are conditional on the imperativeness of work conditions. The fact that wives have greater housework responsibilities than husbands makes work in the home particularly salient for women's psychological functioning.

Greeley	American Journal of Sociology	80	4	1975-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 909-933	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Data from a survey in 1968 of a sample drawn from the population of 15 U.S. cities that had experienced racial unrest revealed clear differences in racial attitudes among members of 10 ethnic groups. The Poles were the least sympathetic to black militance, the Jews the most sympathetic. A model incorporating educational attainment and two measures of general predispositions toward racial problems, called "support" and "avoidance," was used to explain variation of attitudes toward election of a black mayor, civil rights legislation, interracial contact, and repressive riot control. Of the two predispositions, "avoidance" had the stronger effect on acceptability of interracial contact, "support" the stronger effect on attitudes toward riot control and civil rights legislation. There was no direct effect of educational level on any of the four specific racial attitudes. The model successfully explains most of the observed differences between Jews and Poles in these four attitudes. To some extent the differences between these two ethnic groups seem to be related to stronger feelings of alienation among Poles.

This article focuses on how the development and evaluation of human capital varies across cultural settings and on the implications this has for the degree of gender stratification in the economy. An argument is made for the theoretical utility of the concept of a human capital development system, constituded by the way social institutions-and social actors in those institutions-share the responsibilities of human capital development across the individual's life cycle. Japan is seen as having a system of human capital development that encourages the maintenance of greater gender stratification than the American system.

Because parents' education, employment, and economic wealth improve with age, and because younger parents experience stronger competing role demands than older parents, parental age influences children's environments. The average number of siblings also varies with the age of the parents, which affects the family resources to which a child has access. As a result, when other aspects of son's socioeconomic background are controlled, sons born to older fathers enjoy significantly higher levels of educational and occupational achievement than sons born to younger fathers.

Mare	American Journal of Sociology	89	1	1983-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 54-110	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article proposes a solution to the long-standing methodological problem of incorporating discrete variables inoto causal models of social phenomena. Only a subset of the variety of ways in which discrete data arise in empirical social research can be satisfactorily modeled by conventional log-linear or logit approaches. Drawing on the insights of several literatures, this article exposits a general approach to causal models in which some or all variables are discretely measured and shows that path analytic methods are available which permit quantification of causal relationships among variables with the same flexibility and power of interpretation as is feasible in models that include only continous variables. It presents methods of identifying and estimating these models and shows how the direct and indirect effects of independent varibles can be calculated by extensions of usual path analysis methods for continuos variables An important distincion developed here is that discrete variables can play two roles: (1) as measures of inherently discrete phenomena and (2) as indicators of underlying continous variables. The value of this distinction is shown in two empirical examples examined previously by other authors. In examining the effects of social background and parental enouragement on college plans of high school seniors, the article shows that modeling a discrete measure of encouragement as an indicator of a latent continous variable rather than as an inherently discrete variable (as has been done in previous analyses) provides a clearer interpretation and a superior fit to the data. In examining the effects of state Fair-Employment-Practices Legislation on black-white wage differentials, this study shows that two distinct effects on the relative wage can be detected: the direct ameliorative effect of the law itself and the effects of the popular progressive sentiment for racial equality of which the law is an indicator. The methods and models presented here are not only natural generalizations of structural equation and path analysis methods for continuous varibles to include discrete variables but also provide a means of investigating a richer variety of substantive hypotheses than is feasible with methods for discrete data commonly used in the sociological literature to date.

The practice of agreeing with another by repeating what they have said is shown to constitute the action of confirming an allusion-that is, confirming both its "content" and its prior inexplicit conveyance. The author reviews the past treatment of "action" in sociology and the key constraints on undertaking an empirically grounded account. The account of "confirming allusions" is offered to exemplify what this undertaking will involve: several instances of an unremarkable usage in conversation are displayed and used to formulate a puzzle, a database is developed for the exploration of the target usage, and a candidate solution to the puzzle is formulated, exemplified, and defended through a range of analytic techniques. The linkage between the practice and the action that it implements is analytically sketched by examining other uses of repetition in talk-in-interaction. In conclusion, the significance of both the theme and the analysis for studies of interaction and culture and for sociological theory is discussed.

It is shown in a formal game-theoretic model that gifts serve as "signals" of a person's intentions about future investment in a relationship, and inefficient gifts can be beter signals. Other explanations for the inefficiency of gift giving are advanced, and some stylized facts about gift-giving practices are described (many of which are consistent with the signaling view of gifts).

Despite Parson's well-known critique of early modern liberalism in its utilitarian form, his own thought progressively incorporated the utilitarian image of a modern social order.

Late Parsonian theory came to criticize attacks on the alleged utilitarian atomism of modern society as destructive of the special forms of solidarity on which modern community is based.

Ross	American Journal of Sociology	95	6	1990-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1505-1535	The University of Chicago Press	fla		According to the consolation-prize theory of alienation, low-status people feel less distressed by their situation when they reject responsibility for outcomes in their own lives. Recent evidence suggests this is false. Studies do not find that blaming chance, fate, or powerful others reduces the distress associated with low status. Failure to confirm the central tenet fo the consolation-prize theory of alienation ahs stimulated two new alternatives to it. One, called "illusory control as false consciousness," says the distress produced by low status can be canceled by an illusion of personal control. The other, called the "threshold of dysfunction," says that there are diminishing subjective returns to a greater sense of control, so that people with low status get the greatest subjective gains from an increase in control. Results from a community survey are consistent with a unified model. They indicate that (1) there is no limit to the subjective benefits of a greater sense of control due to greater status, (2) there are diminishing subjective returns to a greater sense of control when status is held constant, and (3) the optimum sense of control increases with higher status.

Before 1980, the U.S. government assisted both providers and recipients through financial outlays. Now, however, while seeking to cut costs, the government has become more involved in regulating the activities of both hospitals and physicians. The vehicle of this change in state intervention is the diagnostic related group, or DRG, system of prospective payment to hospitals, adopted in 1983. The article shows how the DRGs, system of prospective payment to hospitals, adopted in 1983. The article shows how the DRGs affect the delivery and substance of health care and concludes that DRGs enhance the capacity of the state to govern the health care system as a whole and manage its factors of production. This "step-by-step" growth of government regulation in a political atmosphere that endorses private enterprise and marketplace rate setting is termed the "paradox of liberal intervention."

The new models are attractive in terms of mathematical parsimony, statistical goodness of fit, conceptual clarity, and suitability for application in comparative work. The favorable results are attributed partly to the fairly substantial degree of disaggregation of occupation categories. The models capture some of the flavor of the regression approach to mobility in that they show in straighforward manner how the destination distribution is shifted for each shift of one or more steps on the scale of occupational origins.

Such influence activities may bring benefits to the organization, but they also involve real costs. This essay offers an economic rationale for such influence activity as representing rational, self-interested behavior in the presence of informational asymmetries and an analysis of how the design of the organization's structure and polices should respond to the incentives for attempting influence. It is posited that information valuable for the organization's decision making is directly available only to members of the organization who have some personal stake in the decisions. These individuals may then have an incentive to try to manipulate the information they develop and provide in order to influence the resulting decision to their benefits. This can be costly both in degrading the quality of decision making and in diverting the attention and effort of the organization's members from more productive activities. The organization has three different methods it can employ to discourage excessive influence activities and to encourage more directly productive uses of time and effort. It can limit access to decision makers and participation in decision making; it can alter its decision-making criteria to favor those performing well in productive activities; and it can provide direct financial incentives to encourage the desired allocation of effort. It is shown that an efficiently deisgned organization will use such financial incentives only as a last resort. Instead, it will always first alter its decision-participation polices and decision-making criteria.

This article develops a class of diffusion models that nicorporate spatial and temporal heterogeneity by turning to the individual level within an event-history framework. These models permit the analyst to represent social structural relations thought to channel diffusion, and to model decay in the influence of events over time. Heterogeneous diffusion models are applied to a reanalysis of data reported in Coleman, Katz, and Menzel's classic diffusion study. Network centrality and local structures of influence based on cohesive relations and structural equivalence are all shown to channel the diffusion of tetracycline.

Otto	American Journal of Sociology	81	6	1976-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1360-1383	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Spady's hypothesis that level of participation in high school extracurricular activities has a lagged effect on educational attainment is tested on a sample of 17-year-old Lenawee County, Michigan, males studied in 1957 and again in 1972 (N=340). The hypothesis is extended to estimate a model of the effects of adolescent social integration on occupation, income, and adult social integration. The major finding with respect to occupation and income is that incorporating adolescent social integration enhances the predictive power of the models only marginally, but such integration functions as an important mediator in the process whereby background socioeconomic status is transmitted to sons. Adolescent social integration is a strong predictor of adult social integration, and an estimate is made of the stability of the social integration constuct over a 15-year interval. Analysis is by multiple regression based on correlations corrected for unreliability, a strategy relating measured variables to their latent constructs so as to make explicit the differential reliability among indicators and the bearing of validity on causal systems.

Frey	American Journal of Sociology	85	6	1980-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1396-1417	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Postwar declines in the economic bases of large older cities have been linked, in part, to the increasing share of low-income minorities in their residential populations. Since the groundwork for these changes was laid by decades of black cityward migration from the South and a substantial suburbanward movement of city whites during the immediate postwar years, policymakers are now becoming concerned with the race-migration consequences of proposed urban programs-though often on the basis of little empirical evidence. This analysis employs data from several census sources to estimate the aggregate consequences of race-specific movement streams on the residential economic bases of 12 large central cities during two postwar intervals. Decreases in city revenue-producing capacity directly attributable to both black in-migration and white "flight" are found not to be large in either the late 1950s or late 1960s, and, owing to changes in the volume and selectivity of movement, the adverse effects of both streams appear to be decreasing over time. In contrast, the nonmigrating black residential population has increased its influence on the demographic and economic structures in most of these cities.

This paper introduces another indicator that is conceptually similar but empirically distinct: the association of husbands' and wives' occupational statuses. Five important findings emerge: (1) the association is symmetrical-it does not matter whether husband or wife is taken as referent when assessing the association; (2) most of the association is due to status consistency between husbands and wives; (3) the strongest status effect separates lower nonmanual from blue-collar occupations; (4) the compound effect of consistency and status effects is to produce strong status-group boundaries separating farm from nonfarm and manual from nonmanual occupations; (5) a comparison with a father-son mobility table reveals a striking amount of similarity, reinforcing the view that the husband-wife association and father-son association tap the same underlying structure.

Logan	American Journal of Sociology	98	6	1993-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1388-1427	The University of Chicago Press	fla		A novel method for location analysis at the individual level is used to analyze the determinants of proximity to non-Hispanic whites separately for Asians, blacks, Hispanics, and for non-Hispanic whites themselves. The resulting regression analyses, for which the percentage of non-Hispanic whites in a community serves as the dependent variable, reveal how the familiar P* segregation measure is generated through locational patterns that map racial/ethnic-group members with specific personal and household characteristics into communities with specific mojority-group proportions. The analyses are developed from two complementary theoretical models- spatial assimilation and place stratification-and applied to the suburban communities of the nation's largest metropolitan region, surrounding New York City, as of 1980. Consistent with the place-stratification model, proximity to non-Hispanic whites is very different for members of the white and black groups and little affected by their individual characteristics other than race. By contrast, Asians and Hispanics appear more consistent with the spatial-assimilation model.

Denton	American Journal of Sociology	94	3	1988-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 592-626	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article examines trend in suburganization for blacks, Hispanics, and Asians from 1970 to 1980 in 59 U.S. metropolitan areas and consider the effect of suburbanization on segregation at the latter date. Suburbanization is measured as the proportion of each group residing outside the central city but within the SMSA, and segregation is measured with indices of dissimilarity and exposure. Despite recent increases, blacks remain less suburbanized than other minority groups. They are less segregated in suburbs than in central cities, but, even in suburbs, black segregation remains quite high. Hispanics and Asians are considerably more suburbanized than blacks. Their segregation in central cities is generally moderate, and in suburbs it varies from low to moderate. Multivariate models indicate the persistence of barriers to the spatial assimilation of blacks. Given the same objective characteristics and metropolitan context, blacks are much more segregated than Hispanics or Asians.

Friedkin	American Journal of Sociology	96	6	1991-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1478-1504	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Three measures of actors' network centrality are derived from an elementary rocess model of social influence. The measures are closely related to, and cast new light on, widely used measures of actors' centrality; for example, the essential social organization of status that has been assumed by Hubbell, Bonacich, Coleman, and Burt appears as a deducible outcome of this social influence process. Unlike previous measures, which have been viewed as competing alternatives, the present measures are complementary and, in their juxtaposition, provide for a rich description of social structure. The complementary indicates a degree of theoretical unification in the work on network centrality that was heretofore unsuspected.

Sly, Jeffrey Tayman	American Journal of Sociology	86	1	1980-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 119-138	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The theory of ecological expansion is examined and propositions are developed which suggest that, at advanced stages of metropolitanization, population loss resulting from migration is a function of the decentralization of nonresidential activities from cores to rings coupled with the increased importance of rings as residential centers and the incursion of the residential function into areas beyond the boundaries of the metropolitan community. The changing structure of rings suggests that they are emerging as the hubs of metropolitan activities and that are serving an increasingly central role, integrating cores and areas beyond the boundaries of metropolitan communities as the residential function invades the latter. Although hypotheses are developed to test each of the propositions offered, and although our analysis lends support to the revisions of the theory, the analysis is greatly constrained by the lack of fit between the metropolitan area concept and the census demarcated Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas.

Meyer, Nancy Brandon Tuma, Krzysztof Zagórski	American Journal of Sociology	84	4	1979-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 978-986	The University of Chicago Press	fla		We use recent survey data to compare intergenerational mobility of Polish and American men. Father-to-son occupational mobility is considerably lower in Poland than in the United States, mainly because Poland has a large, traditional agricultural sector with high occupational inheritance. Furthermore, education, which is substantially affected by father's occupation in both countries, has a much larger effect on occupational attainment in Poland. This striking difference is not so surprising when one considers that the Polish educational system has stronger allocative powers, is more highly selective, and is differentiated laterally (into types) as well as vertically (into levels). When farmer's sons are excluded, the overall rate of mobility in Poland is similar to that in the United States. However, within the urban sector the direct effect of father's occupation on son's occupation almost disappears, while educational effects remain strong. So Polish urban mobility is almost completely filtered by the educational system.

Novels by Americans are compared with those by foreign authors over four time periods. The sample novels reflect the different market positions occupied by the two groups of authors owing to the presence or absence of international copyright protection, the formal demands of the genre, the sex of the author, and several distinctive national characteristics, including treatment of race, middle-class protagonists, and domestic settings.

Hauser	American Journal of Sociology	89	2	1983-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 420-431	The University of Chicago Press	fla		In a 1973 Australian survey, Broom et al. located two distinct subsamples of men in which fathers and sons reported their own status characteristics and those of their sons and fathers, respectively. Inconsistencies between these two subsamples led Broom et al. to infer that "respondents report (perhaps unconsciously) their socioeconomic careers and the careers of their kin in such ways as either to maximize differences between themselves and their sathers or to minimize differences between themselves and their fathers or to minimize differences between themselves and their sons." If true, this would invalidate most stratification research. Reexamination of the Australian data suggests that the paternal and filial reports are not directly comparable. In a sample of Wisconsin men, parental and filial reports of status variables provide unique and direct evidence about the response biases postulated by Broom et al. There is negligible evidence of such biases. Given the relative strengths of the Australian and Wisconsin research designs, we do not believe that further concern about the presence of this type of response error is warranted.

It is here argued that the single term "social evolution" was actually applied by Spencer to four quite different theories-an inherent source of difficulty for his readers. This essay, which strongly affirms each discipline's need for an accurate history of itself, provides a novel but fully documented analysis of what Spencer himself understood by "social evolution." It is concluded that an entirely new chapter on Spencer is required before either his historical or contemporary relevance can be accurately gauged.

Contextual explanations for individual behavior argue that (1) individual preferences and actions are influenced through social interaction, and (2) social interaction is structured by the social composition of the individual's environment. Thus, a preliminary step to constructing contextual theories of individual behavior is an examination of the way that the social context structures social encounters and friendship choice. The empirical correspondence between the content of neighborhood social contexts and the content of social networks is examined using a sample of white male Detroit residents. A mathematical model of associational choice is developed that incorporates the ability of individuals to enforce social preferences on their choice of friends while it maintains the role of the social context in structuring that choice.

This article is a preliminary examination of how the U.S. Senate moved from a strong pro-involvement stance to a strong anti-involvement one. The main findings are: (1) the aggregate change in Senate voting came about disproportionately through replacement of supporters of the war by opponents, as opposed to changes of mind by incumbents; (2) nevertheless, dovish bills adopted toward the end of the conflict would have passed even without the support of replacements, because incumbents were converting fairly rapidly; (3) doves were disproportionately Democrats, relatively young, low in seniority, and from the northeast and north central states; (4) elections were important in the Senate change of mind, but often not in the way expected; rather than doves defeating hawks toward the end of the war, hawks tended disproportionately to die or retire and may have been replaced by doves because most candidates running by the end of the war were doves. Theoretical implications and research proposals are discussed.

Both ability and social origin help to explain selection for type of secondary school. Attending one of the more elite forms of secondary school (grammar, technical, or private) is associated with higher levels of attainment, even with ability held constant. Formal qualificaitions, awarded according to universalistic standards, and opportunities for further education after leaving school type are tempered, but the effects are strong throughout.

Reflection on social sources of such loss leads to recognition of the unique particularistic relationships constitutive of the family as a source both of identity bestowal and identity loss. The archival function, the retention and display of symbols of highly personal identities, furthers the family's potential as a reactive and proactive source of identity loss. Furthermore, if social change is characterized by differentiation and rationalization, maintenance of traditional family structures may result in high potential for painful personal identity loss for which there is low social support and legitimation. Moderns would thus face the dilemma of whether to seek strong affective ties but risk nonlegitimated and meaningless identity loss or to avoid the sources of such identity loss but weaken affective relationships.

This theoretical strategy embodies " E-state structuralism," wich unites the social psychological formalism of expectation states theory with social network research. Using the development of status hierarchies via differential participation in group discussion, the formal model synthesizes (a) the conceptual structure of Fisek, Berger, and Norman, (b) Balkwell's formula for status effects on probabilities of directed participation, and (c) Fararo and Skvoretz's E-state structuralism model for the formation of dominance structures. After describing this synthesis, the article presents the model in axiomatic form and provides a simulation of its dynamic consequences.

Multiple methods of anlysis reveal several systematic biases. In spatial representations individuals' self-perceived positions are closer to the centroid than their group-perceived positions. Graph-theoretic centrally measures show that group members tend to have highest centrality in their own digraphs, and they tend to report more ties, more reciprocated ties, and more transitive triples among those they report, as opposed to those they do not report, as friends. Despite these individuals biases, correspondense analysis provides a valid group-level representation of the friendship network.

Eight data sets are analyzed at two levels of analysis, state and county: 50 states at six different times betwen 1933 and 1980 and 216 counties in 1970 and 1980. The religous and family integration variables are generally supported at both levels of analysis and across the 47 years of the study. Contrary to previous studies, support is found for Durkheim's thesis that Catholics have lower suicide rates than non-Catholics. Strong Catholic/non-Catholic suicide differences are found even when the analysis is extended to 414 counties in 1970 and 1980.

This article assembles data to show that opposing sides in the June Days were virtually identical with respect to class origin as measured by self-reported occupation. A comparison of the two groups most central to the insurrection and repression-the Parisian National Workshops and the Mobile Guard, respectively-suggests the alternative conclusion that variations in political behavior resulted from a combination of members' positions within the artisanal hierarchy and collective organizational experience between February and June.

Weakened informal social controls and anomic aspirations lead to delinquent drift and extremist and delinquent involvements. East Berlin youth are uniquely exposed and vulnerable to anomic aspirations and associated right-wing extremism, but their schools and parents play significant roles in suppressing their rightwing attitudes. Schools and families are underappreciated sources of informal social control and resulting social capital that constrain right-wing extremism and related problems of young people during a period of rapid social change in the former East Germany.

Why, then, did Durkheim write his Latin thesis on Montesquieu, insisting that the latter had "laid down the principles of the new science"? The answer is twofold: first because Montesquieu himself was extremely ambivalent about the French Enlightenment's confident legacy of Cartesian reationalism and second because this made Montesquieu's The Spirit of the Laws the "perfect forge" within which Durkheim could explore his own ambivalence about the relative merits of French rationalism and German empiricism, and thus shape the tool-the comparative method-he applied in The Division of Labor in Society.

The postself is conceptualized as an idealized role-identity that links the present to the future and to the past. Various media forms indicate that athletes and their others frequently become concerned about how they will look to future audiences. The characteristics of the social world of sport that foster concerns about immortality as well as the reactions of individuals to these factors are discussed. The emergence of the postself through sport contributes to our understanding of selfhood, time, social worlds, social structure, and social process.

Marsden	American Journal of Sociology	90	5	1985-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1002-1021	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Ronald L. Breiger raised an intriguing set of issues for mobility analysts by suggesting that attention must be paid not only to the pattern of mobility between social classes but also to the manner in which occupations are to be mapped into social classes. This article examines two related models-collapsibility and internal homogeneity-for analyzing occupational mobility tables according to this scheme, by reformulating them as restricted latent class models in which the unobserved class variables are made explicit. The parametric representation of both models provides additional insight into how they differ. In particular, it clarifies the different ways in which they operationalize the criterion of "common mobility chances" for aggregating occupations into classes. The latent class model also permits the formulation of a new model for relationally defined social classes, a model that recognizes that the correspondence between class boundaries and occupational boundaries may be imperfect and that "marginal" occupations may be mapped into two or more classes. A model of this sort provides a good fit to the classic 8 x 8 British mobility table; this model appears to the both conceptually and statistically simpler than the internal homogeneity model.

Fitzpatrick	American Journal of Sociology	87	4	1982-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 921-934	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Intermarriage provides an excellent indicator of assimilation and of the social distance separating ethnic groups. Using 1975 marriage records this report describes the intermarriage patterns of five Hispanic groups in New York City. Particularly for the second generation, there are high rates of out-group marriage, both with other Hispanics and with non-Hispanics. Puerto Ricans provide a major exception to this pattern, having low rates of out-group marriage in both generations. A control for group size does not explain the low Puerto Rican second-generation rate. A comparison with 1949 and 1959 data indicates that an earlier trend toward Puerto Rican marital assimilation has reversed. Several possible explanations for the Puerto Rican pattern are suggested.

Hypotheses are developed from an institutional perspective that focuses, first, on uncertainty arisin from government mandates concerning equal employment opportunity and affirmative action and, second, on the role of the human relations professsions in constructing employment-relations law and prescribing models of compliance. Event-history techniques are used to test these hypotheses against competing arguments concerning the internatural structure and labor market position of employing organizations. Results on all outcomes strongly support the institutionalist model.

This study examines the intellectual, cultural, institutional, and social conditions of legitimation of Jacques Derrida's work in the two countries and develops hypotheses about the process of legitimation of interpretive theories. The legitimation of Derrida's work resulted from a fit between it and highly structured cultural and institutional systems. In France, Derrida capitalized on the structure of the intellectual market by targeting his work to a large cultural public rather than to a shrinking group of academic philosophers. His work appealed to the intellectual public as a status symbol and as a novel and sophisticated way to deal with late 1960s politics. In the United States, Derrida and a group of prestigious literary critics reframed his theory and disseminated it in university departments of literature. His work was imported concurrently with the work of other French scholars with whom he shared a market. Derrida's support is more concentrated and stronger in one discipline than the support for other French intellectuals. In America, professional institutions and journals played a central role in the diffusion of his work, while cultural media were more central in France.

Seligson	American Journal of Sociology	83	3	1977-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 632-652	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper examines the prestige hierarchy among peasants. A rank ordering of nine peasant types is analyzed using paired comparisons data from a probabiltity sample of 531 Costa Rican peasants. Through the use of a multidimensional point-vector analysis it is found that two dimensions (security-insecurity and legality-illegality) underlie the data. Variations in the prestige heirarchy are shown to be largely the result of remoteness from central locales, a finding which supports the work of Haller, Holsinger, and Saraiva (1972) on Brazil. An explanation for the finding is cast in terms of Costa Rican social history and the importance of security in peasent society. It is concluded that previous research emphasizing the uniformity of prestige hierarchies needs to be reexamined in the light of these findings.

This article uses comparative historical techniques to explore why some American medical specialties were more successful than others in dominating adjacent professions. Three major traditions in the sociology of professions are unable to fully account for such differences. This article offers an alternative explanation. Specialties best able to subordinate ancillary workers are those receiving support from established segments within medicine. Thus, relations between segments within a dominant profession powerfully affect its boundaries with other occupations.

This article investigates intracorporate executive conflict management in a Fortune 500 manufacturer via ethnographic methods. It focuses on the links between executive conflict management and widespread innovations in (1) top managerial formal structure and (2) hostile takeovers and their symbolic imagery. More speciafically, the article focuses on how these innovations disrupted the traditional social structure and "rules of the game" among top managers. The resulting new "culture of honor" suggests several implications for the study of managerial uncertainty, inertia, accountability, and control in contemporary American corporations.

This assertion was based on an analysis of the rates of success of 53 social protest groups arising in America between 1800 and 1945. This article shows frist that Gamson's results are based on a series of very weak assumptions and on frequently spurious zero-order correlations. When data on the rates of protest group success are reanalyzed, no effect of organizational or tactical parameters is evident. Additional data on the timing of social protest group success are then introduced, and a stochastic model is presented which closely fits the data (r > .95). With the help of this model, the timing of success is also shown to be substantially independent of the organization and tactics of the protest group. Finally, a new interpretation of the probability of protest group success, based on the incidence of broad national crises, is suggested.

Carrier	American Journal of Sociology	88	5	1983-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 948-974	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Learning disability theory is presented to illustrate the way educational knowledge often misrecognizes and masks social influences on pupil performance. Learning disability researchers misconstrued their object of study, unexplained underachievement, interpreting it neurologically and ignoring classroom practices and events and the social forces shaping them as possible causes. As a result the theory masks societal forces as they affect academic performance. Some consequences of this masking for educational knowledge and social policy are considered. These flow the fact that the theory, like educational knowledge in general, is shaped by and thus reflects larger extra-educational forces at work in the society.

With 1,291 college students as respondents, this study hypothesized that men are more likely than women to show bias against women teachers or scholars. When former college teachers were evaluated, men students ranked women less favorably than men, but women students ranked men less favorably than women. Although a substantial minority of students had no sex preference for instructor in any size of class, among those who did, more preferred men teachers than women, and the larger the class, the greater was the preference for a man teacher. Men were slightly more likely than women to agree with an opinion attributed to a scholar of the same sex. This study fails to support Goldberg's conclusion and points out the need for replication.

Recent revolutions surprised social scientists as much as anyone else. This article proposes that revolutionary surprises will occur repeatedly, although it is possible to identify countries relatively likely to experience a sudden explosion. The argument hinges on preference falsification-the act of misrepresenting one's preferences under perceived social pressures. By falsifying their preferences with regard to the incumbent regime, disgruntled citizens distort perceptions of the potential for political change. The article's key proposition may be refuted by building a model that successfully predicts when and where revolutions will occur.

Although recent developments in human ecology have emphasized the adaptation of cummunities to external contingencies, this internal emphasis has continued to dominate the criminological literature. This paper examines the effects of radical change in adjoining areas on local delinquency rates. Evidence is presented that such external processes have a significant effect on local rates of delinquency. The consideration of these processes may explain why some stable, organized communities are nevertheless characterized by high rates of delinquency. Suttle's concept of the defended community provides a promising means of incorporating these findings into general ecological models of crime and delinquency.

Present-day tourism is best understood as a recent manifestation of an enduring art of travel whose performance entails movement through space in conventionally stylized ways. Sociological research on current and historical manifestations of this art can benefit from theoretical traditions developed in the study of other domains of expressive culture. Drawing on the sociology of art as well as on recent literary scholarship, this paper proposes that the reproduction and modificaton of distinctive travel styles be examined in terms of the social worlds of their producers.

This paper attempts to extend this theoretical perspective by examining some of its implications for political orientations and relationships. As many segmentations proponents are aware, conventional liberal and Marxist theories have systematically underestimated the persistence of heterogeneous political structures and processes in advanced capitalist societies. Data gathered in the Maritime Providences in Canada show that at both the establishment and the worker level there are distinctive political effects attributable to location in particular economic segments. The increasing range of segmentation theory raises important questions for our dominant paradigms.

Arguments against general theoretical models have proliferated, while the complexity and uniqueness of historical events and the virtues of inductive methods have been emphasized. The growing convergence of sociology and history has led to a decline in the use of general theories. This article begins with a description and analysis of the recent transformation of the methodology of comparative-historical sociology. An overreliance on inductive methods has resulted in inadequate specifications of causal relations and causal mechanisms in recent comparative-historical sociology. The concluding section discusses a nascent rational choice research program in political sociology to illustrate an alternative methodology.

Philip Morgan	American Journal of Sociology	96	2	1990-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 405-432	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The pattern of assortative mating among European immigrants and native whites is examined by ethnicity and generation using a national sample drawn from the 1910 census manuscripts and a sample of marriages registered in New York City between 1908 and 1912. The pattern of assortative mating is virtually identical in the two data sets. Endogamy was strong for all groups examined, but was castelike for the "new" ethnics from eastern and southern Europe. Marriages between "old" and "new" ethnics were especially rare. The pattern of ethnic intermarriage was nearly identical for men and women. Within ethnic groups there was also strong generational endogamy: immigrants tended to marry other immigrants and second-generation ethnics tended to marry others in the second generation. While the existence of ethnic and generational endogamy at the turn of the century is not surprising, its strength has not previously been estimated with appropriate statistical techniques. Further, these techniques reveal more detailed features of the pattern of assortative mating that are not well known and provide important facts for theories of immigrant assimilation and assortative mating.

What is distinctive about the structure of U.S. schooling is its limited degree of stratification. The ways in whih class analyses have explained this pattern are reviewed critically. Class anlayses have failed because (1) they neglect the role of the political process in transforming class interests into institutional patterns, and (2) they neglect the process by which political structures themselves become important determinants of class formation. The role of class forces on U.S. schooling has been very limited when compared with Europe. This minimal effect of class has been a function of the political system, which has operated to limit the extent to which class interests and conflicts could be politically transformed into those political decisions that shaped schooling. The American "exceptionalism" in Schooling is traced to the "exceptionalism" of its class formation, and then back to the character of the political process in the United States.

A Critique of Bourdieu's Distinction	David Gartman	American Journal of Sociology	97	2	1991-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 421-447	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Pierre Bourdieu's theory of culture as a system of symbols furthering a misrecognition of class is critically compared to the Frankfurt school's theory of culture as reifying cimmodities furthering an unrecognition of class. Because of their approaches to history, both theories recognize only part of the complex reality of modern capitalist culture. Bourdieu's ahistorical structuralism fails to grasp the historical changes produced in culture by capitalism, while critical theory's essentialism fails to specify the concrete factors mediating the historical effects of capitalism on culture. As a corrective to both, a neo-Marxist theory is developed that grasps the totality of capitalist culture by grounding the effects of class on culture in concrete, historical class struggle.

Blockmodeling procedures are used to analyze data on German writers and to indentify a social structure in which positions vary according to the types and amounts of capital accumulated. A strong split between elite and marginal writers dominates the social structure, and even the fundamental distinction between high and low culture is embedded in this bipartition. Significant differences in both cultural and social capital distinguish elite from nonelite positions; within this bipartition, pronounced differences in cultural capital separate high and low culture. Relative to cultural and social capital, economic capital plays a lesser role in understanding the social structure of cultural fields.

This paper presents new findings indication that imitation and suggestion have a powerful have impact on social behavior: Three days after a publicized suicide, automobile fatalities increase by 31%. The more the suicide is publicized, the more the automobile fatalies increase. The age of the drivers is significantly correlated with the age of the person described in the suicide story. Single-car accidents increase more than other types just after the publicized suicide. After persentation of these and related findings, the paper discusses some ways in which the concepts of suggestion and imitation can be incorporated into sociological theory.

The approach is applied to the aggregate change of mind by the U.S. Senate as it moved from support of the Vietnam war to opposition from 1964 to 1973. Substantively, cumulative war costs, public opinion, and antiwar demonstrations all had significant effects on Senate roll call outcomes, but they were so highly intercorrelated that their separate effects could not be disentangled. In addition, demonstrations taking place in the months before a vote had a slight positive impact on the number of dovish votes received by motions. The 1970 invasion of Cambodia seems to have led to a significant turning point in the way the Senate dealt with the war. The general strengths and weaknesses of the new approach are assessed. It opens a new area to statistical inquiry and generates a number of novel questions that should lead to additional research.

Using newly available data, this analysis classifies homicide into two types, primary and nonprimary, based on the victim/offender relationship. Two models that have appeared in the literature are replicated, utilizing this classificatory scheme. State primary-homicide rates are found to be related to poverty and to the percentage of the population aged 20-34, while nonprimary homicide rates are significantly related only to the percentage of the state living in urban areas. Replication of the original models demonstrates that the failure to classify homicides in this manner results in the incorrect assessment of the relative size and importance of the various predictors of homicide included in these models.

Leifer	American Journal of Sociology	96	3	1990-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 655-683	The University of Chicago Press	fla		In league sports, the regulatory authority of leagues is thought to counter market pressures that would otherwise concentrate player talent in SMSAs with the largest market potential. The presumed opposition between authority and markets is not supported by league histories in the four major team sports. These histories show that, contrary to expectations, market potential has the greatest influence on winning when league authority is formally strongest. Market potential has no influence on performance when league authority is opposed by antitrust law, player unions, rival leagues, or league members. To explain this anomaly, authority and market relations must both be seen as embedded within the multiplex relations among team owners. These relations changed dramatically with the rise of national audiences in the past three decades. Inequality among equals replaced inequality among unequals as the support of a rootless national audience replaced rooted and unequal local audiences, altering the opportunity context of owners.

The financial evaluation of a man's life introduced by the life insurance industry was initially rejected by many as a profanation which transformed the sacred event of death into a vulgar commodity. By the latter part of the 19th century, the economic definition of the value of death became finally more acceptable, legitimating the life insurance enterprise. However, the monetary evaluation of death did not desacralize it; life insurance emerged as a new form of ritual with which to face death.

Wilcox	American Journal of Sociology	82	4	1977-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 826-844	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The literature on racial residential segregation in American metropolitan areas reports contradictory findings on the decade of the sixties. Some researchers have concluded that average scores declined between 1960 and 1970, while other point to evidence of increases. This paper presents tract-based indexes for all 237 SMSAs (and their central cities) in 1970 and a comparable set of indexes for 1960. These are also cross-tabulated against region, population size, and minority proportion. Several conclusions are drawn: (1) overall, the data indicate a general decline in the average level of segregation between 1960 and 1970; (2) much of that decline is due to the relatively low scores among SMSAs added during the decade; (3) contradictory findings reported in the literature are likely to be due to sampling or other methodological inconsistencies; and (4) clear variations in levels of segregation persist with regard to region, population size, and minority proportion. The importance of these findings for future research is discussed.

The Continuity of the Development	Richard Munch	American Journal of Sociology	87	4	1982-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 771-826	The University of Chicago Press	fla		In The Structure of Social Action, Talcott Parsons developed a theory of action which corresponds in structure and method to Kant's critical philosophy. The core of this theory is the assertion that every action is to be understood as a product of the interaction of dynamizing and controlling forces. This basic proposition is elaborated into a theory through the construction of a four-dimensional "action space," which can be further differentiated into subsystems possessing varying degrees of orderedness. The differential effect of dynamizing and ordering forces on any given action is determined by its locationin the action space and by the kind of relation obtaining between the subsystemsof the action space. The relation between these subsystems which enables them simultaneously to expand their areas of effectiveness is interpenetration. The entire development of Talcott Parsons's theory of action is a progressive refinement of the theoretical devices available for the analysis of such processes of interpenetration. This is demonstrated in this essay for all the various stages of Parsons's theoretical development, from the laying down of thetheoretical core in The Structure of Social Action (1937) through The Social System (1951) to Action Theory and the Human Condition (1978).

Sometimes the critical mass provides some level of the good for others who do nothing, while at other times the critical mass pays the start-up costs and induces widespread collective action. Formal analysis supplemented by simulations shows that the first scenario is most likely when the production function relating inputs of resource contributions to outputs of a collective good is decelerating (characterized by diminishing marginal returns), whereas the second scenario is most likely when the production function is accelerating (characterized by increasing marginal returns). Decelerating production functions yield either surpluses of contributors or order effects in which contributions are maximized if the least interested contribute first, thus generating strategic gaming and competition among potential contributors. The start-up costs in accelerating production functions create severe feasibility problems for collective action, and contractual or conventional resolutions to collective dilemmas are most appropriate when the production function is accelerating.

The authors first model the breakdown of the traditional ascriptive, status-based system, and then identify a more dynamic, achievement-based system, and then identify a more dynamic, achievement-based system as its replacement. By relating the structure of careers to organizational growth and social change, the authors explore how the modern achievement career came about. More broadly, they argue that optimal matching enables one to see clearly the multiple time frames that are necessarily intercalated into career systems and hence provides new insights into the discontinuous and contingent nature of organizational change.

This paper shows that seven basic rhetorical formats were associated with nearly 70% of the applause produced in response to 476 political speeches to British party political conferences in 1981. The relationship between rhetoric and response is broadly independent of political party, the political status of th speaker, and the popularity of the message. Performance factors are found to influence the likelihood of audience response strongly.

For U. S. children whose mothers have recently remarried this report documents the ages and number of siblings at the time of remarriage, the previous marital status of the new stepfather, the duration of single-parent experience before remarriage, and the age and education of the mother. Estimates are also made of the acquisition of a half sibling through second-family fertility. Finally, the consequences of these patterns for the parental and sibling composition of the families of all U. S. children in 1980 are examined.

Distributive explanations emphasizing partisan preferences about macroeconomic outcomes and their effects on different income groups are gauged by letting the explanatory variables have dissimilar effects when different parties hold office. Independents are included so multinominal logit can be used to trace movements between all three identification choices. When a Democrat is president, increased unemployment heightens Democratic identification but inflation has no effects. When a Republican is president, increased unemployment and inflation reduce Republican identification. These results reveal historically contingent relationships between macroeconomic outcomes and partisan coalitions.

Brody	American Journal of Sociology	92	3	1986-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 657-677	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Converse (1964) proposed the black-an-white model of attitude stability to describe over-time resonses to repeated questions. The model consist of two groups who are maximally heterogeneous on the crystallization dimension of attitudes. The class of "true attitude" holders provides an identical response at each time period with certainty; the over-time responses of the class of "nonattitude" holders are statistically independent. Previous research employing this model with three-wave panel data has considered all respondents who provided even one "no opinion" or equivocal response as nonopinion holders and combined this group with the estimated nonattitudes under the model. This results in very high levels of nonattitudes. In this research, an argument is developed for treating the nonsubstantive responses probabilitstically. When the tabulations analyzed include an equivocal response category, the simple black-and-white model no longer fits. An alternative black-gray-white model is proposed that fits the data well. Estimates of nonattitudes under this model are markedly lower than under the black-and-white model.

One, derived by Winship, requires that patterns of social affiliation be strictly transitive. The other, based on Granovetter's ideas about weak and strong ties, requires only a special limited form of transitivity. When these alternative models are tested with data on human interaction, it turns out that the Winship model does not fit the data but that the model developed from Granovetter's work does.

A literature review is presented that points to a number of shortcomings in existing studies, most of which are associated with the psychological reductionism that predominates in this area of study. An effort is made to provide a sociological account of voluntary risk taking by (1) introducing a new classifyin concept- edgework-based on numerous themes emerging from primary and secondary data on risk taking and (2) explaining edgework in terms of the newly emerging social psychological perspective produced from the synthesis of the Marxian and Meadian frameworks. The concept of edgework highlights the most sociologically relevant features of voluntary risk taking, while the connections between various aspects of risk-taking behaviour and structural characteristic of modern American society at both the micro and macro levels. This approach ties together such factors as political economic variables, at one end of the continuum, and individual sensations and feelings, at the other end.

Alexander	American Journal of Sociology	101	4	1996-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 797-839	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Organizations face pressures from their environments. When external pressures conflict with each other or with internal desires, organizational personnel face dilemmas. This article examines conflicting pressures in a setting where they are particularly salient: art museums. Various stakeholders, notably external funders and museum curators, press for specific organizational outpus-that is, particular types of exhibitions. This research examines the format and content of exhibitions from large American museums to gauge the effect of funding. The research demonstrates that funders' importance increased between 1960 and 1986. Funder tastes are translated into exhibitions; however, museum manager use several strategies to retain their autonomy and legitimacy.

Cohen	American Journal of Sociology	86	2	1980-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 359-366	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Theoretical Considerations suggest that, among Mexican Americans, generation, a measure of cultural assimilation, is more closely related to exogamy than is exogamy than is occupation, a measure of structural assimilation. The classic study by Mittelbach and Moore (1968), however, argued that occupational effects were greater than generational effects for Mexican Americans in Los Angeles County in 1963. In contrast, our log-linear reanalysis of those data found them to be consistent with theoretical expectations and showed that the importance of generation in explaining exogamy for Mexican American males is not exceeded by that of occupation.

Henretta	American Journal of Sociology	86	3	1980-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 618-629	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper examines the dimensionality of status measures related to net worth and occupation. The measures of status considered include: home equity, savings, real estate assets, business assets, earnings, and pension coverage. We consider the role of each in status evaluations and examine empirically whether the process of attainment of each is the same. We reject this hypothesis and present a final model that allows a different process of attainment for each measure. We find that, net of earnings, family formation measures have large effects on the different status measures consistent with different patterns of family needs. Finally, we discuss the implications of using wealth and consumption measures as measures of status.

Kreps, Susan Lovegren Bosworth	American Journal of Sociology	99	2	1993-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 428-463	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Descriptions of organizing and role enactment during the emergency periods of disasters are developed from archival materials on 257 key participants in 106 organized responses. Organizing is measured as a continuum of formal organizing to collective behavior. Three unique dimensions of role enactment are isolated empirically: status-role nexus, role links, and role performance. The three dimensions are modeled in terms if the structural form and type of organizing within which role enactment occurs as well as a series of other structural and individual correlates. Findings from the modeling codify the disaster research legacy as it contributes to sociological theory.

How Women's Schooling and Career Affect the Process of Family Formation	Hans-Peter Blossfeld, Johannes Huinink	American Journal of Sociology	97	1	1991-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 143-168	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Proponents of the "new home economics" hypothesize that women's growing economic independence largely accounts for the rise in delayed marriage and motherhood in industrialized societies. This article assesses this hypothesis for the Federal Republic of Gernamy by estimating the dynamic effects of women's educational and career investments on the timing of family events. Eventhistory analysis shows that the delaying effect on the timing of the first marriage across cohorts does not result from an increase in the quality of women's human capital investiments as posited by the new home economics. Rather, women's extended participation in schooling delays their transition to adulthood, an effect aligned with normative expectations that young women in school are "not ready" for marriage and motherhood. Increasing career resources, however, do lead women to postpone or avoid having children.

Staples	American Journal of Sociology	93	1	1987-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 62-88	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper examines the social relations of production at a British metal-trades firm throughout the 19th century. The case study reveals the existence of two distinct political apparatuses, or regimes, identified in provious literature, that govern production relations. The first regime, between 1791 and 1867, is described as patriarchal because production is organized around adult, male, internal subcontactors and their families. In the second period, roughly 1868-91, the regime is characterized as paternalistic since it attempts to align the interests of capital and worker through family, work, and community life. The analysis uncovers social and economic forces that undermined the system of internal subcontracting and patriarchy and fostered paternalism. Emerging paternalism shaped the struggles over the introduction of new technologies that formed the basis for the real subordination of labor to capital.

Beck	American Journal of Sociology	85	4	1980-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 791-814	The University of Chicago Press	fla		In this paper the effects of labor unionism on the degree of interrace and intrarace income inequality in the post-World War II Period are investigated. Two opposing theoretical positions are outlined: the first views unionism as a means of maintaining the favorable economic status of whites to the detriment of nonwhites, whereas the second position views unionism as a manifestation of the consciousness of the working class in capitalistic society. The former point of view predicts that gains in unionism will lead to heightened between-race inequality but reduced within-race inequality. The latter suggests that such increases will produce declines in both between- and within-race inequality. Using a national aggregate time series for the 1947-74 period, this study found more support for the white-protectionist than for the class-consciousness interpretation.

This paper uses data from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Young Women and Young Men to examine the transition to marriage and how it differs by sex, testing the extent of variation in the desirability of marriage for men and women, and the effects of marriage market factors and marital and nonmarital roles. The design of the analysis allows the effects of these factors to vary over the young adult years. The pattern of findings suggests that recent declines in the marriage rate have not resulted from increased barriers to marriage but from declines in relative preferences for marriage.

Southwood	American Journal of Sociology	83	5	1978-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1154-1203	The University of Chicago Press	fla		For a series of theoretical models involving two independent interval-scale variables acting together to produce a joint causal effect, different modes of analysis are described. In each case statistical interaction is involved, but the form of this interation differs with each model. Methods for deriving appropriate interaction terms are given. These models provide a flexibility for statistical analyses appropriate to a broader range of theories than can be treated well by conventional regression procedures. If, as seems likely, theoretical propositions are often stated in empirical research in a form appropriate to additive multiple regression, these methods suggest that such propositions might be reexamined and reformulated. It is possible that the methods have particular relevance for some aspects of functional, equilibrium, balance, and conflict theories.

However, these theories have not been tested relative to different social classes. Since most of the evidence has accumulated in the United States, where demand is usually met by supply, the possibility that demand might not be met has been ignored. This article relies on the concept of controlled expansion, testing whether the policies and politics of the central French state influenced the expansion of secondary schooling between 1881 and 1975. The state's policies regarding the supply of pupil spaces and the improvement of quality affected actual enrollment growth when the influence of labor structure and institutional values is controlled. Importantly, both economic demand and state supply exert differing levels of influence on the elite school system versus the mass system.

Three central contingencies of an initial metamorphosis, from sober dispositions to doing laughter, are specified. The would-be laugher must collaboratively construct the presumption that another person shares his or her perspective on the mirror's reflections, develop mutually untenable definitions of a person and that person's reflections, and display a corporeal appreciation of the sensed juxtaposition. Each of these dimensions is altered when participants undergo a second metamorphosis, a shift to being done by the spirit raised. A final section analyzes the trascendent powers of family relations as they play on glaces bizarres.

Marshall	American Journal of Sociology	80	5	1975-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1124-1144	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Sociologists and gerontologists have frequently noted that the necesity for learning new social roles continues throughout the life cycle. Thus, Riley et al. (1969) argue that, in addition to myriad small adjustements, "major adjustments are also required as the occupational role gives way to one of leisure-in-retirement; as the combined roles of spouse-and-parent shift, after the children leave home, to the role of spouse without parental responsibilities, and later to widowhood; as relationships to descendant kin proliferate to grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and numerous in-laws; and as preparation is made for ultimate death." This paper focuses on the last of these "major adjustments"-"preparation... for ultimate death"-and argues that congregate living facilities can provide optimal settings for this form of socialization. It views a retirement village as a relatively "non-total" (Goffman 1961) "people-processing institution" in which residents themselves devise means for their collective socialization for impending death. I Suggest that we can learn from this setting about the conditions favorable to successful socialization.

The present paper attempts to fill that gap. Each instance of Weber's usage is cited and discussed. Next, the place of elective affinity in his order of discourse is determined. Then, the lineage of the term in the histories of literature, chemistry, and philosophy is examined with special reference to Weber's knowledge of those histories. Two related terms, "affinity" and "inner affinity," are examined and brought into relationship with Weber's use of elective affinity. These materials suggest that elective affinity, conceived as an "idea" in the Kantian sense, would have served to answer the question, How is social science possible? which was implicit in the neo-Kantian framework of Weber's order of discourse.

Molm	American Journal of Sociology	94	6	1989-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1392-1418	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article analyzes exchange networks that provide actors with two sources of power: power over rewards to others and power over punishment of others. Theoretical analysis of unequal power relations suggests that punishment is the most likely power strategy of actors who are disadvantaged members of relations imbalanced on reward power. A structural advantage in punishment power should provide these actors with the potential means to balance power in the relation. Previous findings have suggested, however, that the high reward dependence of these actors can constrain their use of punishment. This study shows that the use and effects of punishment are significantly altered by the average levels of reward power and punishment power in the relation. The power-balancing effect of punishment is most likely to occur when an actor lacking reward power has punishment power that is strong relative to the other actor's but weak in absolute strength.

Orthodoxy is shown to be positively related to militancy, while sectarianism is inversely related. Orthodoxy, viewed as churchlike ideology, is shown to be significantly related to church participation. Sectarianism, interpreted as part of the general culture of less educated blacks, is tangential to the religious system per se. Sectarianism is unrelated to participation in a religious organization. The results of a secondary analysis of the Gary Marx data are also reported.

Krohn	American Journal of Sociology	96	2	1990-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 300-328	The University of Chicago Press	fla		In this article, the causal structure of Colvin and Pauly's "Integrated Structural-Marxist" theory of delinquent behavior is explicated, and testable hypotheses are examined by using data from the Richmond study on white males and females. The results indicate that measures of membership in different "fractions" of the working class are not consistently related to family or school compliance structures as the theory predicts. However, hypotheses concerning the relationship between family compliance structures and school compliance structures, parental attachment, association with delinquent friends, and self-reported delinquent behavior are generally supported. Few differences are observed in separate analyses for males and females. Although the results raise questions about Colvin and Pauly's emphasis on a reconceptualized construct of social class, their incorporation of family and school compliance structures in their causal model is a promising contribution to the development of integrated theories of delinquency.

Reanalysis of income and economic growth data using a categorical indicator of world-system status derived from Snyder and Kick suggests that dependency does increase income inequality and retard per capita economic growth net of initial development. This offers renewed support for world-system theory by rebutting Weede's criticism of Rubinson, and Jackman's criticism of Snyder and Kick.

Kemper, Randall Collins	American Journal of Sociology	96	1	1990-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 32-68	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article argues that there are two central relational dimensions of microinteraction that are aggregated into social structures. One dimension, power, entails conduct by which actors compel other actors to do what they do not wish to do. The other dimension, status, entails conduct that conveys voluntary compliance, deference, and acceptance. The article considers a number of findings that seem to argue against the power-status model but contends that the exceptions either are not sociologically pertinent or do not reflect relational conduct. On the basis of an analysis of social and cultural macromodels that appear in the work of Parsons, Weber, Douglas, and Hirschman, it is argued that the power and status dimensions may be generalized "upward" to macroconditions. Two applications of power-status analysis, one from the domain of stratification, the other from the domain of emotions, conclude the article.

Kaufman	American Journal of Sociology	89	3	1983-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 585-611	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This research demonstrates the impact of labor market structure and segmentation on differentials in black and white earnings. This paper argues that there are two very different factors which create black-white earnings differences: (1) differences between blacks and whites within divisions of the labor market, and (2) differences between labor market divisions in earnings combined with the differential distribution of blacks and whites across labor market divisions. Use of a decomposition based on a regression standardization approach discloses that the second factor accounts for a minimum of 14% of the black-white earnings gap. This implies that eliminating all black-white differences within labor market divisions would still leave a significant earnings gap between blacks and whites due to the structure of the labor market.

Phillips	American Journal of Sociology	87	2	1981-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 404-412	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Recent research by Phillips suggested that publicized suicide stories triggered a rise in suicides, some of which were disguised as motor vehicle fatalities (MVF). The most striking finding of his research was a 31% jump in California MVF on the third day after publicized suicide stories. Yet, until they are replicated, we do not know whether these results are limited to: (1) California, (2) the time period studied (1966-73), or (3) the method of analysis used. In this research note we replicate Phillip's California analysis with Detroit metropolitan data for 1973-76. We use two different statistical techniques to insure that Phillips's findings are not an artifat of his method of analysis. We find a 35%-40% increase in Detroit MVF on the third day after a publicized suicide story. Our replication suggests that Phillips's most striking result the third day peak in MVF is not limited to a particular geographical region, time period, or technique of analysis.

Two theories of justice processes, "the exchange theory" and "the balance theory," are described and applied to experimental studies of coalitions. In these cases, three specific predictions may be made: (1) coalition attempts will be more frequent in unfair cases than in fair ones, (2) members of a revolutionary coalition will attempt to restore equity under specified conditions, and (3) the precise response to inequity depends on which theory of justice is used to define "fairness." A coalition experiment was conducted to test the predictions. Data confirm predictions (1) adn (2); with regard to (3) they provide better confirmation for the balance prediction than for the exchange prediction.

Meyer	American Journal of Sociology	83	1	1977-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 55-77	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Education is usually seen as affecting society by socializing individuals. Recently this view has been attacked with the argument that education is a system of allocation, conferring success on some and failure on others. The polemic has obscured some of the interesing implications of allocation theory for socialization theory and for research on the effects of education. But allocation theory, too, focuses on educational effects on individuals being processed. It turns out to be a special case of a more general macrosociological theory of the effects of education as a system of legitimation. Education restructures whole populations, creating and expanding elites and redefining the rights and obligations of members. The institutional effects of education as a legitimation system are explored. Comparative and experimental studies are suggested.

Examining new evidence in the paradigmatic case of General Motors (GM), this article shows that such approaches are poorly equipped to explain changes in the M-form. For most of its history, GM intentionally violated the axioms of efficient organization to create managerial consent. The GM case suggests that the textbook M-form may actually undermine order within the firm, thus leading to organizational decline.

The party and region of the representatives were controlled. While for the House as a whole there was little support for the hypothesis that representatives from districts highly dependent on defense spending were more likely than representatives from nondependent districts to vote for jingoistic foreign and defense policies, certain subgroups such as the very senior members did evidence such correlation between defense spending concentrations and voting. These results are discussed in terms of pluralist, elitist, and other theories of societal governance.

The article introduces the concept of "structural mutualism" to account for the structural effects of required league membership on team foundings and deaths. This term refers to cooperative behavior that occurs among the teams within a league, that benefits each team, and that league membership promotes. Net of conventional density-dependence and population-dynamics mechanisms, strong evidence is found that structured mutualism affects team foundings and deaths. When structured mutualism is conceived of as variable, the concept may have more general applicability to other sets of membership organizations.

Fischer	American Journal of Sociology	101	3	1995-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 543-577	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Over the last 20 years, some urban sociologists have placed Fischer's 1975 article, "Subcultural Theory of Urbanism," on equal footing with Wirth's 1938 classic, "Urbanism as a Way of Life," as an explanation of urban-rural differences. But ambiguities in Fischer's subcultural theory require clarification before its validity can be thoroughly judged. Ironically, a few of these conceptual problems may have led to underestimating the theory's plausibility. Recent empirical research is typically consistent with subcultural theory but includes important failures and significant gaps. Clearer theoretical specification should enable researchers to better test subcultural theory and decide among different explanations of urbanism's social implications.

Johnson	American Journal of Sociology	92	2	1986-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 384-411	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper estimates a model of the relationship between self-rejection and deviance, mediated by disposition to deviance, to examine the linear structural equations in data provided by a threewave panel study of junior high school students. The measurement models and latent structure more accurately reflect the theoretical basis of the postulated structure than do earlier multivariate analyses of panel data. The latent construct "self-rejection" (modeled in terms of global self-derogation, lack of desirable attributes, and experiences of rejection and failure in family and school) a Time 1 has the expected strong positive effect on the latent construct "disposition to deviance" (measured in terms of disaffection from, and readiness to adopt deviant alternatives to, conventional family, school, and community patterns) at Time 2 which in turn has the anticipated strong positive effect on the latent construct "deviance" (reflecting the commonality underlying the adoption of any of a range of deviant behaviors in three different groupings based on probability of occurrence). These findings differ from those of other multivariate analyses guided by the same theoretical framework that report negligible effects of self-rejection on deviance. The differences in findings are due to the theoretically indicated decisions in the present analysis to model (1) self-rejection in terms of the association between negative self-feelings and experiences of rejection in the conventional environment, (2) self-rejection as having major direct effects on acquired disposition to deviance, and (3) deviance as general behavioral outcome that might be expressed in terms of any of a number of behaviors that violate conventional norms. Further, the present analysis permits the relaxation of assumptions regarding infallible measurement.

New institutionalists maintain that interests are embedded in institutional arrangements and change as institutions change. China has undergone rapid and extensive household income mobility, incrementally altering the stratification order based on socialist redistribution. The shift to markets causes a decline in the significance of positional power based on redistribution relative to the gains of producers and entrepreneurs. Comparative institutional analysis is employed to examine the effect of regional variation in the extent of institutional change.

Mechanics' institutes were founded by artisans and capitalists ca. 1820 with the aim of teaching artisans natural science. With the focus on skilled engineering workers in Manchester, the paper argues that, as the autonomy and work skills of these and other workers declined, the goal of a broad science education for artisans was replaced by that of a narrower technical education. The paper concludes with a discussion of contemporary implications.

Models of institutional influence and of within-school processes are developed for both secondary and postsecondary education to integrate and refine the literatures on school effects and returns to schooling. Rather impressive occupational status and earnings differentials are associated with gross school-to-school differences and with qualitative differences in educational experiences within institutions. Secondary school characteristics and experiences weigh particularly upon the market outcomes of youth who terminated formal schooling at high school graduation. We suggest that the traditional use for quantitative indices of schooling (years of school completed or certification levels) in assessing the market consequences of investments in education needs to be supplemented by information on qualitative variations in educational experiences. Additionally, the likelihood that school experiences may have quite different implications for selected target populations deserves further consideration. The simplistic assumption implicit in much of the school-effects literature that institutional effects are homogeneous may actually mask quite important consequences for certain students.

House	American Journal of Sociology	101	2	1995-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 404-432	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The authors examine the effect of various single-parent childhood family structures on adult marital quality and perceived stability. The authors find no important differences in marital happiness by family history. However, among adults in less than very happy marriages, both adult children of divorce and adults who never lived with their father report significantly higher chances of divorce than those from two-parent families. Among those in relatively unhappy marriages, children of divorce more often report patterns of interaction that are likely to strain a marital relationship. Children of divorce are significantly more likely than those from two-parent families to have thought their marriage may be in trouble.

The examples pertain to (a) reconciling response distributions that differ because of question wording (or other context effects), (b) assigning a metric to an ordinal variable, (c) assigning scale scores to response patterns which arise from a Guttman-type model, and (d) analyzing multiple (ordinal) indicators. The log-multiplicative model presents a unified framework for analyzing each of these problems.

Waite	American Journal of Sociology	86	2	1980-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 272-294	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The concept of the "family life cycle" provides a valuable context within which to study labor force participation of married womem. This article tests the hypothesis that the process by which wives make the decision to supply labor to the market varies with position in that life cycle. Data from the National Longitudinal Survey of the Education and Labor Market Experiences of Young Women are used in an examination of market activity during the early stages of the cycle, from marriage through the completion of childbearing. The effects of the most important determinants of married women's labor force involvement are found to depend on life-cycle stage. Wives who consider their families complete tend to be more responsive to family financial circumstances and the characteristics of the labor market in which they live than do childless women or mothers who expect more children. History of employment is found to be most important in predicting current market activity for mothers who expect more children and least important for those who do not. Implications of the findings are discussed.

Wilson	American Journal of Sociology	84	3	1978-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 684-697	The University of Chicago Press	fla		In past attempts at predicting income attainment, education and occupation have been recognized as the most intuitively appealing causal factors but have yielded especially dismal empirical results. This paper attempts to demonstrate that the relatively poor success at predicting income attainment with these variables can be corrected with straighforward recalibrations of their scales. A scale of occupations is drawn from classical notions of work hierarchies as well as from recent economic theory on the power of the employing firm. A scale of educational training targeted toward the new scale of occupations in offered as a logical corollary to the theory that stands behind the scale of occupations. The combined explanatory power of the new measures substantially increase the prediction of income attainment over past work in the area. Limitations of the measures and sample are discussed, and suggestions for future improvements are offered.

Johnson, Ryoko Nishida	American Journal of Sociology	86	3	1980-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 496-511	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Since there is a racial majority in California but not in Hawaii, these two states provide a natural experiment for testing the minority-status theory of fertility. The following propositions were deduced from the theory: (1) no net differences in Japanese, Chinese, and white fertility in Hawaii; (2) lower Japanese, and Chinese than white fertility in California; (3) lower Japanese and Chinese fertility in California than in Hawaii. Support for the first and third propositions and partial support for the second proposition in 1970 census public-use samples suggest that minority status may have depressed the fertility of currently married Japanese and Chinese women in California. The implications are explored.

Devine, Michael Wallace	American Journal of Sociology	88		1982-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. S113-S153	The University of Chicago Press	fla		In this paper we systematically assess the neo-Marxian view that military expenditures are used by the state as a countercyclical fiscal policy either to forestall a serious recession or to facilitate economic recovery. In particular, we examine the post-World War II political-economic experience of the United States, because the military expenditures thesis was most fully developed initially in an attempt to explain postwar American prosperity. We evaluate what we term the "naive" model of Baran and Sweezy, which suggests that the degree to which national output is absorbed by military spending should be dependent on aggregate economic conditions such as unemployment. Finding only inconsistent evidence to support the naive view, we incorporate the insights of recent neo-Marxists (especially O'Connor) on the linkages among the monopoly corporate sector, the unionized sector of labor, and the state. The empirical evidence appears consistent with this "modified" view, with unemployment in the unionized sector and rate of growth of monopoly profits significantly affecting variation in military expenditures as a percentage of GNP during the postwar period. We then introduce a variety of controls in an attempt to determine if our results are simply statistical artifacts of equation specification, of time dependence, of estimation procedures, or of measurement strategy. Despite a multitude of such checks, we find that our results remain statistically significant and in the predicted direction. We do find, however, that additional economic (i.e., concentration) and political (i.e., the electoral cycle) variables also affect military spending.

We show that the British stratification system is somewhat more closed than that of the United States: there is less intergenerational occupational mobility in Britain, and the correlations among status variables are generally stronger. However, despite radical differences in the educational systems, the role of educational attainment in occupational mobility is highly similar in the two countries.

This paper questions that hypothesis on both theoretical and methodological grounds by exploring (a) ambiguities in the links between patriarchy and capitalism and (b) the meanings of housework across cultural and historical settings. A research agenda is proposed in which it is suggested that housework is both an ordeal of civility through which individuals judge their joint membership in the same social milieu and an ordeal of conviviality through which individuals who pass within the same milieu reinforce social bonds. The conclusion elucidates why changes in the division of housework should not be synonymous with the eradication of tasks.

Hauser	American Journal of Sociology	93	6	1988-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1401-1423	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This note compares two structural equation models of educational and occupational resemblance among sibling pairs. Each model decomposes the regression of occupational status on schooling into a between-family regression of common factors and a pair of within-family regressions. In model 1, the within-family regressions are writhin-family factors, and in model 2, the within-family regressions are written in the total educatinal and occupational variables. The two models are equivalent when within-family regressions are the same for each member of the sibling pair. Otherwise, they are not equivalent, and the second model has an undesirable logical implication. Under certain conditions, either model may exhibit symptoms of near-underidentification, or it may be underidentified; this problem may be more likely to occur in model 2 than in model 1.

B. Macpherson's critique of power in liberal-democratic societies. Macpherson shows that disalienation is possible in Marxist theory only if material abundance or undifferentiated access to the means of production is provided. In contrast, Parsons's approach to the study of modern society emphasizes that differentiated responsibility and authority for production and organization are irreversible and increasing. Because of this systemic trend toward functional differentiation, a single normative standard for recognizing either necessity or abundance in absolute terms cannot be assumed. Parsons's analytical approach to the economic subsystem of the social system also moves him to reject economists' notions of consumer sovereignty and utility. Thus, his schema dismisses a anachronisms bothe the "absolutism" of the model of the free market.

In addition, estimates are developed of the extent to which observed homophily in friendship dyads results from a process of selection (assortative pairing), in which similarity precedes association and the extent to which it results from a process of socialization in which association leads to similarity. The implications of the results for interpreting estimates of peer influence derived from cross-sectional data are discussed.

Kandel, Kazuo Yamaguchi	American Journal of Sociology	92	4	1987-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 836-878	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Life and drug histories collected in a longitudinal cohort of young adults age 24-25 are analyzed to specify the dynamic relationships between patterns of drug use and job separations. Three patterns of drug use are investigated: daily alcohol use, monthly use of marijuana, and monthly use of other illicit drugs. Job changes followed immediately by another job are distinghished from job losses not followed by new employment within a month. Two processes assumed to underlie the relationship between drug use and job mobility are distinguished: selection, in which individual predispositions account the self-selection into job separation, and causation, which reflects the specific effects of drug use on job separation. Drug use has a strong effect on job separation, which appears to be mainly a selection effect, however. The results document the importance of drug use in predicting high job mobility and subsequent unemployment in late adolescence and early adulthood. The neglect of this life-style factor in prior analyses has led to overestimations of the negative effects of job duration and marital status and the positive effect of prior experience of a job separation on future separations.

Focusing on the movement for equal employment opportunity (EEO), the article considers how often minorities and women mobilize federal EEO laws in their fight for equal treatment in the marketplace, how often they with their cases, and how victory is related to thier ability to organize and to get help from the federal government. Analysis of one aspect of the mobilization of EEO laws-in the federal appellate courts-leads to some conclusions very much in keeping with recent work on social movements. They are that the relationship between grievances and mobilization is problematic, that blacks remain central to the struggle for equality in the United States, that resources matter for challengers of the status quo, and that the federal government can be extremely important when it chooses to intervene on the side of women and minorities.

It develops a model of the manner in which environmental variations affect the life changes of specialist and generalist organizations. This model predicts that death rates of generalists exceed those of specialists in fine-grained environments, regardless of the level of variability, but that generalists have lower death rates when environmental variation is both coarse grained and large. The model is applied to a sample of restaurant organizations in 18 California cities. Maximum likelihood estimates and tests confirm the major predictions of the model.

Our research on the Single Market Program (SMP) of the European Union (EU) shows that both elements are part of the process. When the EU was caught in a stalemate, the European Commision devised the SMP. The commission worked within the constraints of existing institutional arrangements, provided a "cultural frame," and helped create an elite social movement. This examination of the SMP legislation, using an institutional approach to the sociology of markets, shows how the commission was able to do this by trading off the interests of important state and corporate actors.

Antonio	American Journal of Sociology	94	4	1989-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 721-748	The University of Chicago Press	fla		From the start, emancipatory theory has been plagued by contradictory and incompletely elaborated normative underpinnings that weaken its sociological and ethical credibility. Jurgen Habermas, the leading contemporary critical theorist, has attempted to address this problem in an extensive reconstruction of the theories of Marx and Weber that appropriates elements of American pragmatist thought. Yet he resorts to an evolutionary normative argument that undermines the sociological powers of the two classical theories and contradicts the pragmatists' historical approach to values. This essay explains the significance of Habermasian theory for the emancipatory tradition, analyzes certain problems of the theory, and argues that an expanded dialogue with American pragmatism would strengthen both its sociological and its normative dimensions. Though the explicit focus is on the emancipatory tradition, the essay raises broader critical questions about pseudohistorical, normative justification in general sociological theory.

Ortega, Carolyn Briggs Style	American Journal of Sociology	94	5	1989-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1117-1145	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The role theory of aging and the maturational perspective differ with regard to whether aging is a problematic or positive process. This article looks at the self-concept and self-evaluation of men and women over the adult life course, using data from a large national probability sample. The evidence indicates that as persons age their self-concepts, while not qualitatively different from that of younger persons, contain more positive attributes, fewer negative attributes, and become better integrated. Age is also associated with a positive self-evaluation, as indicated by life satisfaction, self-esteem, and an index of meaninglessness. Ther are some odest gender differences in these age relationships, but, overall, males and females appear to experience aging in similar ways. The general impression is that as persons age they become increasingly comfortable with themselves and their situation. Because it is unlikely that these relationships are due primarily to cohort, period, or compositional effects, the article concludes that the data support a maturational perspective.

New life-history data from the Federal Republic of Germany show that there is an impressive equalization of educational opportunities between men and women across cohorts. Despite this covergence in educational levels of men and women, sex-specific differences in the field of vocational training continue to be a major component within the process of sex segregation, both over the life course and across cohorts, in West Germany. At entry into the occupational system an increasing tendency to sex-specific occupational segregation across cohorts is observable. This does not imply that women's occupational chances have become worse across cohorts but the opposite. Across the cohorts, many of the new skilled occupations created by a changing economic structure and the expanding welfare state were filled by young women.

S. youth is reexamined on the basis of a recent, nationally representative data set. Strict comparison with past models is impossible, given differences in measurement, sampling, and time of data collection. Still, the general structure of the final model differs in theoretically significant ways from past findings. Present results reduce the importance of social psychological intervening variables, such as parental status and academic performance. The overall trend of these results suggests a process in which personal influences and subjective orientations are of less significance than the "structural" effects of parental resources and the bureaucratic evaluation of ability. Theoretical and policy implications of these findings are also discussed.

The newspaper publishing industry is examined as an illustration. The ecological focus shows that many small, specialized organizations operate successfully in this industry, despite apparently high levels of local concentration. A resource-partitioning model is advanced to explain the interorganizational relationships between generalist and specialist organizations. Statistical tests of the model using historical data on 2,808 American local newspaper organizations show the merit of using the ecological perspective for analyzing industries.

This new analysis further contextualizes the theory by operationalizing, patriarchy in terms of a direct and parsimonious measure of marital power. Jensen and Thompson's analysis notwithstanding, the core of the power-control model performs well here and in serveral other data sets. Yet further specification of the model is needed in terms of both gender itself and of the family structures and power relationships that establish its scope.

An ideal-type of collegiate organization is identified, and the consequences of the emergence of collegial social structure of this form in professional contexts are examined. These arguments provide a critique of the predominant understandings of the relationship between professionalization and bureaucratization, in which professional ideology is conceived of as ethical commitment. The article calls for ar restoration of Weberian understandings of the rationalization of modern life as the outcome of a contest for domination between interest groups rather than as the institutionalization of transcendent normative structures.

This paper investigates age inequality or bias in public spending for these two age-based dependent groups using annual time-series data for 18 advanced industrial democracies. The results show that a large aged population reduces age inequality in favor of the eldearly in the presence of (1) class-based corporatism and (2) strong leftist parties, whereas a large aged population increases age inequality in the absence of these two factors.

Neil Fligstein, Peter Brantley	American Journal of Sociology	98	2	1992-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 280-307	The University of Chicago Press	fla		There has been a long-standing debate over who controls the large American corporation. The results presented here indicate that existing power relations within the firm, the conception of control that dominates the firm's actions, and the actions of competitors account for the economic actions undertaken by large firms, while the differences in manager or owner or bank control and the presence of bank interlocks do not. A sociology of markets is therefore more likely to account for the courses of actions of large firms by considering these relations, rather than focusing on the construction of interests by bankers, owners, or board interlocks.

As a current paradigm, it is growing in popularity. But the difficulties sociologists have in adapting its concepts to organizations, in extending the theory to apply to social phenomena, and in subjecting it to empirical tests all lead to the conclusion that it is not useful for the study of organizations. In addition, the competition model that is at its center has a very narrow application to organizations.

Using General Social Survey and National Election Survey social attitude items that have been repeated regularly over 20 years, the authors ask (1) Have Americans' opinions become more dispersed (higher variance)? (2) Have distributions become flatter or more bimodal (declining kurtosis)? (3) Have opinions become more ideologically constrained within and across opinion domains? (4) Have paired social groups become more different in their opinions? The authors find little evidence of polarization over the past two decades, with attitudes toward abortion and opinion differences between Republican and Democratic party identifiers the exceptional cases.

Billings	American Journal of Sociology	96	1	1990-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1-31	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Building on Antonio Gramsci's approach to the dynamics of hegemony and counterhegemony, this article develops guidelines for the historical analysis of conditions under which religion promotes either social quiescence or opposition. Gramsci stressed the importance of (1) leadership resources and (2) organizational autonomy for oppositional movements. Social-psychological studies of the processes of religious conversion and commitment bring to light the importance of social support for the plausibility of belief- a third, implicit element in Gramsci's thought. These three factors are examined in a comparison of oppositional movements of coal miners and textile workers in the American South after World War I, when religion proved to be a crucial factor in either blunting or heightening workers' insurgency. Leadership resources, organizational autonomy, and plausibility structures are linked to Gramsci's analyses of the roles of force and hegemony in the formation of social classes.

But unlike many fields, sociology recognizes both journal articles and books, thereby complicating the relation of publication to reputation. Drawing on the sociology of science and organization theory to analyze elite sociology journals and books nominated for a major prize, the authors show how genre structures scholarly fields and shapes the reception of texts. Method and evidence, not subject matter, distinguish articles from books. Private universities "prefer" books, while scholars trained at public universities are more likely to publish articles.

The starting point is the interactionist theory of motivation basic to most of the social psychological research on white-collar crime. Interactionist theory helps us understand white-collar crime in terms of the offenders' symbolic construction of their social worlds but ultimately fails to explain its causes. It is argued that the origins of symbolic motivational patterns are to be found in the social structure of industrial capitalism and the "culture of competition" to which it gives rise. But no theory of motivation, however sophisticated, is sufficient to explaint the causes of white-collar crime, and the paper therefore concludes with an analysis of the patterns of opportunities presented to social actors in different structural positions in advanced capitalist nations.

Quantitative and qualitative data from the second East York study are used to evaluate six potential explanations of why different types of ties provide different kinds of supportive resources: tie strength, contact, group processes, kinship,network members' characteristics, and similarities and dissimilarities between network members in such characteristics. Most relatioships provide specialized support. The kinds of support provided are related more to characteristics of the relationship than to characteristics of the network members themselves. Strong ties provide emotional aid, small services, and companionship. Parents and adult children exchange financial aid, emotional aid, large services, and small services. Physically accessible ties provide services. Women provide emotional aid. Friends, neighbors, and siblings make up about half of all supportive relationships. The ensemble of network members supplies stable and adaptive support.

Cohen	American Journal of Sociology	98	4	1993-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 873-912	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article presents a refined specification of Cohen and Machalek's general evolutionary ecological theory of expropriative crime and results of tests employing two complementary approaches: (1) the development of a game-theoretic model that mathematically tests the logical adequacy of the theory's fundamental assumptions and (2) the conduct of computer simulation experiments to analyze the model's behavior and test its consistency with novel hypotheses suggested by the theory. Mathematical analysis indicates that the assumptions are logically consistent. Experiments generally confirm the theory's hypotheses, but indicate that several modifications are necessary. Additional theoretical insights obtained from the simulation experiments are also discussed.

Turner	American Journal of Sociology	81	5	1976-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 989-1016	The University of Chicago Press	fla		It is proposed that people variously recognize their real selves either in feelings and actions of an institutional and volitional nature, such as ambition, morality, and altruism, or in the experience of impulse, such as undisciplined desire and the wish to make intimake revelations to other people. A shift toward the impulse pole seems to be under way and might be plausibly explained by chaning cultural definitions of reality modified terms of social integration, shifting patterns of deprivation, or new opportunities and consequences. Many standard sociological assumptions about social control are incopatible with the new pattern of self-identification.

This paper formulates and test a neo-Marxian, class-based, power control theory of gender and delinquency. Using this theory and a prediction made by Bonger more than a half-century ago, the article demonstrates that the relationship between gender and common forms of delinquency declines with each step down the class structure. Furthermore, where this relationship is strongest, it can be statistically removed by taking theoretically predicted variables into account. A power-control theory does much to specify and explain the class struture of gender and delinquency, and in doing so it demostrates the social bases of this relationship.

The results show that there is considerable variation in arrest rates between cities and that racial/economic composition substantially affects them, independently of reported crime rates. The effects are specified by type of arrest (property and personal) and race of offender (white and non-white).

Scarcity is always an aspect of capitalist relations, but its specific form is determined historically through the international food order. The latter is a stable set of complementary state policies whose implicit coordination creates specific prices relative to other prices, a specific pattern of specialization, and resulting patterns of consumption and trade. The social consequences of those orderly international arrangements make sense within a Marxist conception of accumulation and class formation on a world scale. I present a historical analysis of the rise of an international food order after World War II whose principal axis was food aid from the United States to formerly self-sufficient agrarian societies. This order had contradictory effects, both economic and political, leading to a reorganization of aid and trade, higher prices, and a possible shift of grain specialization within the international division of labor. The postwar international food order left specific legacies for classes and nations. For example, the low prices of the postwar order contributed to both agricultural underdevelopment and urban concentrations of dispossessed people in the Third World in the 1950s and 1960s as a particular form of capitalist penetration. The elements left by the decomposition of the postwar order, however, are much broader and allow for alternative paths to the construction of a new international food order.

Slomczynski	American Journal of Sociology	95	4	1990-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 964-1008	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article conceptualizes and indexes social class for a Western capitalist country (the United States), a non-Western capitalist country (Japan), and a socialist country (Poland). The idea that social classes are to be distinguished in terms of ownership, control of the means of production, and control over the labor power of others is adapted to the historical, cultural, economic, and political circumstances of each country. It is hypothesized that men who are more advantageously located in the class structure of their society are more likely to value self-direction for their children, to be intellectually flexible, and to be self-directed in their orientations than men who are less advantageously located. The hypothesis that occupational self-direction plays a crucial role in explaining the psychological effect of social class in all three countries is also confirmed. There was no firm basis for hypothesizing the relationships between social class and a sense of distress. The pattern is cross-nationally inconsistent, in part because occupational self-direction does not have the cross-nationally consistent effect on the sense of distress that it has on other facets of psychological functioning.

Craig	American Journal of Sociology	95	3	1989-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 692-722	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article examines the patterns and determinants of first marriage among black and white women in the United States. Three major differences exist between the first-marriage patterns of black and white women: (1) lower proportions of blacks marry than whites; (2) the proportion of women who ever marry has declined substantially across cohorts for blacks but modestly across cohorts for whites; and (3) while increased education is associated negatively, if slightly, with the probability of ever marrying among whites, it is associated positively among blacks. The observed racial divergence is consistent with three factors experienced differentially by blacks and whits: the marriage squeeze, labor-market success, and out-of-wedlock childbearing. Given the traditional age differences between spouses, there are far fewer eligible male mates for black women than for white women among cohorts born before the late 1950s. For both blacks and whites, employment status is positively associated with the propensity to marry, but for young blacks the labor-market situation is generally poor and has deteriorated significantly across time in comparison with other groups. Finally, having an out-of-wedlock child at an early age is strongly negatively associated with the likelihood that a woman will ultimately marry.

Berryman	American Journal of Sociology	92	3	1986-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 568-595	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper explores young women's retention in sex-atypical jobs in the military and in civilian firms. It develops hypotheses about the effects on one-year turnover of sex composition of the occupation in the national labor force. These hypotheses were drawn from several theoretical perspectives on career mobility and the effects of out-group membership on acceptance. Tests of these hypotheses, using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Labor Market Behavior, provide no evidence that being in a nontraditional occupation increases the chances that a young woman will leave her current employer. The military sector shows a more complex relationship between occupational typicality and women's exit from the services.

Gillis	American Journal of Sociology	101	5	1996-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1273-1305	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article suggests that the growth of European states, the decline of familism, and the rise of individualism generated the institutionalization of judicial separation and divorce. Time-series analyses of France (1852-1908) reveal a persistent negative association between separation/divorce and domestic homicide, especially among males. Neither indicators of economic change nor trends in the wider pattern of violent crime account for the relationship. Although marital dissolution is a negative correlate of premeditated domestic homicide, the rate of separation/divorce is directly associated with spontaneous domestic homicide, for both females and males and may indicate that abandoned spouses can become homicidal.

Lehmann	American Journal of Sociology	100	4	1995-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 904-930	The University of Chicago Press	fla		In the Division of Labor in Society, Durkheim conceptualizes deviance as an essentially asocial phenomenon, and the conceptualizes "woman" as an essentially asocial being. Both theories contradict Durkheim's characteristic social determinism, and both encounter, in Suicide, two further contradictions. First, Suicide demonstrates conclusively that relatively asocial individuals, women, are actually much less prone to deviance than relatively social individuals, men. Second, Suicide introduces the theory that deviance is an essentially social phenomenon that is produced by pathological social forces or "currents" rather than by "excessive individualization" and "insufficient socialization." Durkheim's second theory of deviance thus simultaneously rescues his theory of the social nature of men and his theory of the asocial nature of women.

White	American Journal of Sociology	81	6	1976-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1384-1446	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Role structures in small populations are given operational meaning as algebras generated from the sociometric blockmodels of Part I by Boolean multiplication (matrix multiplication employing binary arithmetic). Many different sociometric structures can yield the same algebraic multiplication table, which captures a different level of social structure. Elements of the algebras are interpreted concretely as compound roles, and interlock among these roles is studied through investigation of their algebraic properties (equations and inclusions). Similarities and differences among algebras from six case studies are explored by means of homomorphisms as well as by multidimensional scaling on a derivative numerical distance measure. Results for particular populations, including reliability and stability tests, are summarized through simple target tables reporting aggregations of more complicated role structures.

In contrast to previous approaches, this article treats marriage choice as a multidimensional phenomenon and makes a distinction between ascriptive- and achievement-oriented characteristics. Ascriptive status homogamy is measured by the similarity of spouses with respect to their fathers' occupational class, while the achieved dimension of status homogamy is measured by the similarity of spouses' educational attainment. Multivariate log-linear models are used to explore the relative importance of these factors for the choice of a spouse, and the article tests the hypothesis that there has been a transition from ascription to achievement in patterns of marriage selection. This study first demonstrates empirically that previously conducted synthetic cohort analyses of educational homogamy suffer from selection biases and then, using the Occupational Change in a Generation (OCG) surveys, analyzes two real marriage cohorts. The analyses show that education is a more important boundary in marriage selection than social-class origins and that educational homogamy has increased over time. At the same time, there is some indication that ascription has become a less important boundary in marriage selection.

Robinson	American Journal of Sociology	86	2	1980-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 320-349	The University of Chicago Press	fla		A 1975 exploratory study is used in this investigation of the cognitive maps of class and racial inequalities held by 113 American and 101 English repondents. An Index of Perceived Inequality is constructed from nine items dealing with inequalities, both among classes and between races, of education, occupation, income, respect, and treatment by the police and courts. The index appears reliable and valid, particularly for the United States. For the United States, factor analyses show that perceptions of class inequalities cannot be separated empirically from perceptions of racial inequalities on the basis of their interrelationships. Thus a single dimension can account for the common variation of the nine items. But in England perceptions of class and racial inequalities tend to separate into two distinct, though correlated, clusters. Additionally, for both countries there is support for grouping the items into those dealing with inequality of opportunity and those dealing with inequality of treatment and condition. Finally, compared with the English, Americans perceived more inequality, were more likely to see a growing economic gap between the rich and the poor, saw a larger number of social classes, and were more likely to say that money is the defining criterion of class.

More precisely, the aim is to demonstrate that the synthesis of an abstract, Darwinian model of systematic adaptation and the bahavioral principles of social learning produces a theory of sociocultural evolution having the logical structure and explanatory power of the theory of natural selection presented in On the Origin of Species.

As an attempt to define some of the sociological dimensions of adventurism, this study presents an analysis of "adventure" migration to the California gold fields. Through a comparative examination of the social origins of the California argonauts, several conclusions are offered: (1) Social structure influences differentially the amount and king of risk people are willing to take. (2) The tendency to engage in adventurism is directly related to intense status involvement in one's native society. (3) Because it consists of individuated actions taken in pursuit of particularistic goals, adventurism undermines disciplined, organized group activity.

Hudis	American Journal of Sociology	84	3	1978-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 706-717	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Empirical analyses of inequality trends indicates that gender differentials have remained highly stable in the United States since World War II. We challenge such conclusions of extreme stability with respect to the sexual structure of occupations. The primary focus is on shifts in gender composition, because different occupational distributions of men and women are now regarded as the major source of differential work rewards. We demonstrate that conventional measures of shifts in occupational sexual structure ignore the location and direction of change and that substantively important variations have occured since 1950. But our primary objective is to explain those changes. After indicating that other perspectives fail to account for observed patterns of sex composition change, we suggest complementarities between economists' labor market segmentation approaches and occupational sex segregation. Although our empirical representation of market segments is heuristic, results of analyses of U.S. census data from 1950 to 1970 are largely consistent with a dual labor market interpretation of changes in occupational sexual structure. We conclude with brief mention of substative and policy implications of these findings.

Wells	American Journal of Sociology	90	1	1984-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1-29	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Although traditional economic theories regard sharecropping as inefficient and likely to dwindle in systems of capitalist commodity production, sharecropping has exhibited remarkable persistence under a range of historical conditions. This article explores the reasons for the unexpected tenacity of share farming and considers its implications for the analysis of rural class structure and agrarian change. Using the example of the resurgence of sharecropping in the California strawberry industry, the paper demonstrates that political constraints on agricultural production are key determinants of the contemporary adoption of sharecropping, establishing a context in which sharecropping not only facilitates but is recreated by capitalist accumulation.

Lancaster Jones	American Journal of Sociology	82	4	1977-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 808-825	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Questions relating to the consistency of the stratification order can be posed at the level of social aggregates as well as at the individual level. This paper draws on Australian socioeconomic data to illustrate issues involved in defining relatively homogeneous social strata in terms of commonly occurring status profiles and in exploring the effects of stratum characteristics such as degree of stratum homogeneity and stratum attribute consistency. Positional awareness, defined in terms of class identification and voting behavior, is examined in relation to the contextual variables of stratum homogeneity and stratum attribute consistency, which show weak effects once the average level of socioeconomic status of different strata is taken into account. The low salience of such contextual variables is explained partly by relatively high stratum permeability, reflected in high rates of father-to-son mobility, and partly by the difficulty of establishing that the strata as defined are perceived as naturally occurring groups.

Compared with those of native whites, African-American households were less likely to be nuclear and more likely to be headed by women. Further, African-American women were much more likely than white women to have surviving children who were not living with them at the time of the census. Because such historical differences parallel contemporary ones, the authors call for greater attention to persistent structural, cultural, and demographic factors that affect racial different in family structure.

The method, called optimal matching, is widely used in natural science. The article reviews the literature on sequence analysis, then discusses the optimal matching algorithm in some detail. Applying this technique to a data set detailing careers of musicians active in Germany in the 18th century demonstrates the practical steps involved in the application of the technique and develops a set of typical careers that successfully categorize most of the actual careers studied by the authors.

Blau	American Journal of Sociology	83	1	1977-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 26-54	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Social structure is conceptualized as the distributions of a population among social positions in a multidimensional space of positions. This quantitative conception of social structure is the basis for a deductive theory of the macrostructure of social associations in society. The likelihood that people engage in intergroup associations under specifiable structural conditions can bededuced from analaytic propositions about structural properties without any assumption about sociopsychological dispositions to establish intergroup associations, indeed, on the assumption that people prefer ingroup relations. Group size governs the probability of intergroup relations, a fact that has paradoxical implications for discrimination by a majority against a minority. Inequality impedes and heterogeneity promotes intergroup relations. The major structural condition that governs intergroup relations is the degree of connection of parameters. Intersecting parameters exert structural constraints to participate in intergroup relations; consolidated parameters impede them. The more differentiation of any kind penetrates into the substructures of society, the greater is the probability that extensive social relations integrate various segments in society.

Ross	American Journal of Sociology	86	3	1980-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 479-495	The University of Chicago Press	fla		We examine the psychological well-being of blacks, whites, Mexicans, and Mexican Americans. There are two perspectives on the differences in distress among these groups: the minority-status perspective and the ethnic-culture perspective. Within the context of the minority status perspective, two hypotheses are tested: (1) Minority status per se is distressing. (2) Minority status is distressing only because it is associated with low social class. Within the ethnic-culture perspective, a number of additional hypotheses are tested: (3) Mexican heritage is associated with lower distress (4) because the impact of social stressors is not as great among persons of Mexican heritage as among others. However, (5) Mexicans living in the United States but not raised here suffer distress due to cultural alienation. Within the minority-status perspective, hypothesis 1 is rejected. Hypothesis 2 is supported with the qualification that, although both the black and Mexican minorities are distressed by low income, only blacks are distressed by low education. This finding indicates the usefulness of the ethnic-culture perspective. Since Mexicans have lower distress than others, hypothesis 3 is supported. Hypothesis 4 is accepted because Mexicans are not distressed by low education or by divorce and separation. Hypothesis 5 is rejected. The results suggest that future research should concentrate on the effects of specific cultural arrangements rather than on general minority-status effects.

Much less familiar to us is Mead the reformer, a man who sought to balance political engagement with academic detachment and who established himself as an astute critic of contemporary American society. This paper examines Mead's political beliefs and his theory of the reform process. Drawing on little-known sources and archival materials, it demonstrates that Mead shared socialism's humanitarian ends and that, following the dominant progressive ideology of his time, he sought to accomplish these ends by constitutional means. An argument is made that Mead's ideological commitments had profound effects on his substantive ideas, particularly on the dialectical premises of social interactionism. The final section of the paper discusses the legacy of Mead and the Progressive movement.

The problem that arises is how to construct reward schemes. Group piece-rate schemes are often suggested as a solution. However, these are susceptible to free-rider problems. A classical solution relies on a supervisor who keeps free riders in line. This article duscusses another solution where the relationship between output and reward is highly nonlinear.

The specific question addressed is why Afrikaner Calvinism, which is theologically identical to European Calvinism of the 18th century, had a highly conservative impact on economic action, in contrast to the European case. The theoretical position put forward is that any analysis of religion's secular impact must be contextual and focus upon what is here termed "operant religion," meaning religious belief as it has been actualized within the actor's phenomenal world. The major substantive portions of the paper are concerned with an explication of the way in which the social and historical context of Afrikaner Calvinism shaped Afrikaner operant religion and, secondly, with resulting consequences for economic action.

Empirical analysis of the attitudes of Israeli citizens and public bureaucrats toward their national bureaucracy indicates that becoming a bureaucrat and even achieving high rank within the bureaucracy does not overcome the effect of ethnicity upon attitudes in areas of high salience to specific groups.

While Cain and Wissoker's analyses and results differ in many ways from that of Groeneveld, Hannan, and Tuma, consideration of the full set of estimates (including both main effects and interaction effects) and analyses of the complete samples reveal that their analyses agree that the income-maintenance treatment increased rates of marital dissolution for blacks and whites.

The paper closes with a theoretical critique of conventional arguments and suggestions for an alternative set of questions. These probe the circumstance and procedures by which a sense of ultimate grounding is affirmed or changed, at both an individual and a social level.

Smith	American Journal of Sociology	85	1	1979-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 109-134	The University of Chicago Press	fla		In this paper, I criticized and refine Snyder's (1975, 1977) interpretation of the relationship between institutional setting and industrial conflict. I argue, among other things, that it is always rational for employees to strike when unemployment is low, irrespective of the attitudes of employers or the extent to which a government is favorable to labor and that, consequently, if an economic model of industrial conflict fails to "work," it makes sense to look at the institutional bases of calculative bahavior on the part of organized labor rather than at the attitudes of employers or the government. I illustrate this argument with data from postwar Quebec.

Because he did not distinguish two kinds of rules-imperatives that regulate a preexisting activity and rules of practice that create the activities they defien-he failed to see that some of the social facts he had included in the term's extension had, at the same time, been precluded (both in principle and anomalously) from the term's intension. An upshot was that the imperative, regulative rules of the social order with the activities they govern were emphasizd (by Durkheim) a the expense of social action first constituted and the regulated by rules of practice. Recognition on the distinction between regualtive rules and rules of practice and of their conceptual connections with correspondingly different kinds of social facts redresses the balance.

This paper analyzes data from 160 census industrial classifications in an attempt to assess these alternative predictions. The findings show that the degree of market power in an industry is associated positively with the level of occupational segregation, the degree of unionization is associated negatively with this level, and "classically capitalist" organization of an industry is unrelated to it. These results are interpreted as providing qualified support for the industrial organization theory.

In the case of Renaissance Italy, however, recent empirical studies confirm Weber's view that the scale of modern rational capitalist development was still limited and that economic traditonalism prevailed. Although some thechnical advances were evident (e.g., in accounting), their significance has been exaggerated. This is due in large measure to the use of simplistic evolutionary models of social change which (in Weber's terms) conflate "technical rationality" with "rational economic action."

Each occupation maintains a sense of superior production (an "occupational aesthetic") that is not reducible to organizational demands. This perspective extends the production of culture approach that sees art as being like all work, suggesting, in contrast, that all work is like art. An aesthetic component to work is reflected in the desire to produce objects (or perfom tasks) so as to demonstrate the competence of the worker, as exemplified in a case study of work in four restaurant kitchens. The production of quality is not unbounded, as client demands, organizational efficiency, and the organization's resource base have effects. The centrality of an aesthetic orientation depends upon the market niche of one's organization, career stage in the occupation, and the nature of the work task.

Before their style of working went out of fashion in the 1930s, all the artists studied had been recognized as painter-etchers, but few had achieved a level of renown that guaranteed the preservation of their original oeuvres, a condition that, in the instance of visual artists, is a sine qua non for being remembered. Where such preservation was not assured, the posthumous durability of reputation depended on the artist's own lifetime efforts to protect or project that reputation, survivors with a stake in preserving or enhancing the artist's reputation, linkages to networks facilitating entry into the cultural archives, and retrospective interest leading to the rediscovery of the artist as the symbolic representative of emerging cultural or political identities. Similar conditions for remembering exist in other areas of culture production; these are affected by the rate at which "old" work loses relevance, the nature of the creative achievement, and the medium in which it is preserved.

To overcome these criticisms, this research employs a power-policy model based on a political economy framework which utilizes Molotch's conpetion of the community as a growth machine. Analysis of the Permanent Community Sample provides strong power-policy relationships that support the major tenets of the growth machine explanation: As members of the business elite gain power, they can successfully promote population growth that provides them with greater profits through higher property values. The most widely cited common good for growth, lower unemployment, does not accrue. This supports the relevance of a political economy approach to community phenomena and suggests different directions for community power research.

Evans, Jonathan Kelley	American Journal of Sociology	97	3	1991-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 721-759	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article develops hypotheses about how prejudice can be expected to affect discrimination and tests them in Australia, a nation with numerous and diverse immigrants. Census data, analyzed with a flexible regression model, are from the 1981 1% Public Use Sample (PUS), with detailed information on education, occupation, income, timing of immigration, and language fluency. Attitudinal data, analyzed with LISREL methods, are from a representative national sample (N = 3,012). The analyses show that the sociological hypothesis of prejudice leading to discrimination is both wrong (there is little or no discrimination in jobs and pay) and right (prejudiced employers say they would discriminate in hiring). Economists employers, too,are partly wrong (competition does not force employers to renounce discriminatory hiring) and partly right(minorities receive equal rewards to education with no sign of discrimination on a social distance gradient). The authors suggest that "exclusionary" and "economic" discrimination are fundamentally distinct and that, unless exclusionary discrimination is nearly universal, it does not imply economic discrimination.

Studies of split labor market have so far analyzed the opposite phenomenon: the exclusion of lower-priced workers (of a distinct ethnic background) or their transformation into a subordinate caste. This examination concurs with Bonacich's argument that a major form of ethnic conflict is generated in the labor market but demonstrates the necessity of specifying the historical period of capitalist development in which the victory of higher-priced workers, through the formation of a split labor market, is made possible. Such success is dependent on their degree of influence on the state, which, in turn, depends on their location in the productive process and on their level of economic and political organization.

Debate between the cohesion and structural equivalence models poses the following question for study: Did the physicians resolve the uncertainty of adopting the new drug through conversations with colleagues (cohesion) or through their perception of the action proper for an occupant of their position in the social structure of colleagues (structural equivalence)? The alternative models are defined, compared, and tested. Four conclusions are drawn: (a) Contagion was not the dominant factor driving tetracyclene's diffusion. Where there is evidence of contagion, there is evidence of personal preferences at work.

Refutations proposed in the Becker critique of the specific instance of Pietism and science strengthen rather than weaken the grounds for deepened interest in exploring both the generic and specific hypothesese insofar as the critique exhibits the fallacy of the latest word. That fallacy rests on three common but untenable tacit assumptions: (1) that latest word correctly formulates the essentials of the preceding word while being immune to the failures of observation and inference imputed to what went before, (2) that each succeeding work improves on its knowledge base, and (3) that theoretically derived hypotheses are to be abandoned as soon as they seem to be empirically falsified. An Appendix examines evidence on the sociohistorical particulars of the case.

Operationally, what is required is the embedding of bureaucratic decision making in history. This article proposes the concepts of hierarcy and ecological control as one possible bridge between organization theorists and macro sociologists. A stochastic process model of federal budgetary decision making within the executive branch is developed and tested using HUD program allocation data from the Johnson administration. The model emphasizes that budgets emerge from the interaction of three levels of organizational decision making, each of which is embedded in a distinct cultural context. Historical application focuses on the impact of the Vietnam War on domestic antipoverty and housing programs.

Each of the following explanations receives some support: resistance to government coercion generally and especially to coercion from the federal government, concern over social class differences between blacks and whites, concern over the consequences of open-housing laws, and general antiblack prejudice. The weighting of and relations among these various factors is still to be determined, but it appears clear that no single, simple explanation will suffice. The paper also illustrates the value of combining experimentation with traditional survey design in substantive investigations.

That work had indicated that, as the high-culture novel evolved, the occupation "novelist" behaved like an "empty field" and men edged women out of their former numerical dominance as novelists. This paper examines the processes of political dominance through which men edged women out of participation in the evolving "Great Tradition of English Literature." It also studies how publications contributed differently to the fame garnered by early men and women writers and by late ones. The method used is regression analyses of data gathered from the Dictionary of National Biography and the British Museum Catalogue.

Matsueda	American Journal of Sociology	97	6	1992-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1577-1611	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article draws on behavioral principles of George Herbert Mead and other symbolic interactionists to specify a theory of the self to explain delinquent behavior. The theoretical framework builds on Mead's analysis of the social act, symbolic interactionists' specification of the self as a reflection of appraisals made by significant others, and labeling theorists' notions of dramatization of evil, deviance amplification, and secondary deviance. This integrated framework is tested with a causal model of the causes and consequences of reflected appraisals and delinquent behavior. The analysis provides general support for the theory. Reflected appraisals of self are substantially affected by parental appraisals and prior delinquency; future delinquency is sustantially affected by reflected appraisals of self as a rule violator; and reflected appraisals mediate much of the effects on delinquency of parental appraisals, prior delinquency, and structural variables.

College transcripts from a large eastern university were examined to determine whether the lower persistence rate of females is a consequence of a generally lower level of academic performance. The evidence indicates that the differential rate of application is only slightly determined by sex differences in academic performance. Most of the variance is the consequence of a unique pattern of persistence. Females with moderate and low levels of academic performance are substantially less likely than males with similar levels of performance to apply to medical school, but those with a high level of performance are equally likely to apply. Existing "normative" and "structural barriers" approaches in explaining the persistence gap are assessed in terms of logic and evidence. A "normative alternatives" approach that may provide a more adequate explanation of these findings is offered.

Carroll	American Journal of Sociology	93	5	1988-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1153-1178	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Although the telephone and automobile are two of the most significant technological developments of the modern era, we know little empirically about the conditions that encouraged their adoption. This paper attempts to explain their diffusion across the 48 contiguous states during the time of their initial popularization and fastest growth and examines which macrostructural attributes of states encouraged or discouraged their widespread adoption. It also examines whether these technologies stimulated or inhibited each other. The findings suggest that commercialization in urban centers spurred adoption of both the telephone and automobile. A more complex process occurred in rural America. States with many well-off, independent farmers were relatively quick adopters of both technologies. But states with many tenant farmers-primarily southern-were slow to adopt. The data also point to an important historical watershed, World War I: many of the accelerating factors before the war were less critical after the war, and, perhaps more important, the interaction between the technologies changed around the time of the war.

Interconnections are shown to exist among economic hardship, anxiety, and drinking for the relief of distress. These relationships are especially close among intensely anxious people having little sense of mastery and possessing low self-esteem. The results indicate that some functions of drinking stem from experiences and feelings rooted in basic features of social and economic organization.

This had led to certain characteristic problems with occupational classification and the meaningful interpretation of mobility rates. A solution to these problems lies in using the study of social mobility as just one source for understanding social structure and social change. An extended example of such an approach is undertaken by examining the place of small shopkeepers in the occupational structure of mid-19th-century Frankfurt am Main.

Military Expenditures in the United States, 1949-1976" at a less aggregate level than was done by Griffin, Devine, and Wallace. Assuming that distinctive and independent causal processes generate each of four subcategories that include nearly all military spending, Griffin, Devine, and Wallace's model can be transposed with little modification to the two most generously financed subcategories, equipment and personnel. However, their model casts little light on the determination of spending for operations and maintenance and research and development. Still, the level of industrial concentration emerges as an important source of spending on military research development, and this fact is consistent with suggestions in Galbraith's discussion of the "planning sector." Preelection increases in military spending appear to be (efficiently) earmarked for increases in the pay of military personnel.

Possible relationships were explored between the number, duration, timing, and episodes of various nonfamily roles throughout adult-hood and subsequent health and multiple-role occupancy. It was found that occupying multiple roles in 1956, participating in volunteer work on an intermittent basis, and belonging to a club or organization were positively related to various measures of health and that occupying multiple roles in 1956, as well as doing volunteer work, was positively related to occupying multiple roles in 1986.

These conclusions emerge from a reassessment of Glenn Firebaugh's broad critique of capital dependency research, which exposed an important error in earlier studies. The solution charts new theoreticall ground by factoring dependency effects into the differential productivity of foreign and domestic investment and the negative externalities from foreign capital penetration. The revised formulation is applied to cross-national analyses of economic growth, decapitalization, and income inequality. The findings consistently support capital dependency theory.

Taylor	American Journal of Sociology	89	2	1983-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 373-401	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Latent class analysis is used to examine Philip Converse's propositions about political opinion and nonopinion in the American public. Data were taken from the 1956, 1958, 1960 and the 1972, 1974, 1976 American voter panel studies conducted by the University of Michigan Institute for Social Research. Results support Converse's black-and-white model of attitude stability which posits the existence of some stable opinion holders and a group of "nonopinion" respondents whose positions vary unpredictably over time. Rates of opinion holding in the population were estimated to range from a low of 19% for the utilities and housing item, which was Converse's focus, to an atypical high of 59% for the busing item in the second panel. Models allowing for true score change estimated that the number of true score changers was small. The nonopinion respondents were apparently responsive enough to item content that their aggregated responses reflected the climate of opinion among those whose attitudes were better crystallized. As Converse had concluded, there was relatively little overlap of "issue publics"-those who held opinions on one issue were not necessarily opinion holders on other questions. There were not consistent differences in education or political involvement between opinion holders and nonopinion respondents. Relationships of education and political involvement to opinion holding suggest that respondents hold stable opinions on those issues that have greatest personal relevance for them.

Levine	American Journal of Sociology	96	5	1991-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1097-1116	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Simmel and Parsons both formulated distinctive conceptions of sociology before executing their original sociological studies. These conceptions differed with regard to methods and to principles. Their divergences led Parsons to downplay Simmel's work, such that the relationship between Parsonian action theory and Simmelian sociology remains problematic to this day. A major divergence concerns the emphasis by Simmel on forms of interaction and the emphasis by Parsons on the substantive contents of action. This divergence remains even after one clarifies their respective presuppostions by differentiating variables that they confound. Both approache remain viable, particularly if they incorporate certain criticisms with which each confronts the other.

Cecilia Ridgeway, Cathryn Johnson	American Journal of Sociology	95	5	1990-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1189-1212	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This paper analyzes the way task proceedings engender emotional reactions, the conditions under which these are expressed in positive and negative socioemotional behavior, and their effect on the status hierarchy in informal task groups. In links developments in the sociology of emotions to theories of status and provides a theoretical explanation of the predominance of positive over negative socioemotional behavior in task groups. The analysis indicates that the status herarchy asymmetrically limits the expression of negative socioemotional behaviors arising from disagreements but does not constrain positive socioemotional expressions arising from agreements. Performance expectations determine the causal attributions of disagreement and consequently the emotion felt and the likelihood that negative behavior will result. As a result, the overall level of negative, but not positive, behaviors is reduced, status struggles are contained, and group solidarity is encouraged. Also, low-status members often elicit negative emotions but must absorb rather than respond to them.

Although these theories stem from very different intellectual traditions, their general assumption has been that widespread informal economic activities are primarily a feature of Third World economies, in which they function as a refuge from destitution; such activities are presumably destined to desappear with the advance of modern, industry-led growth. Evidence is presented that indicates that these assumptions, including the identification of informality with conditions in the less developed countries, are wrong. Alternative interpretations of the resilience of these activities in Third World countries, despite rapid industrialization, and their continuity and apparent revival in the advanced economies and discussed.

The key concept is that of "threshold": the number or proportion of others who must make one decision before a given actor does so; this is the point where net benefits begin to exceed net costs for that particular actor. Beginning with a frequency distribution of thresholds, the models allow calculation of the ultimate or "equilibrium" number making each decision. The stability of equilibrium results against various possible changes in threshold distributions is considered. Stress is placed on the importance of exact distributions distributions for outcomes. Groups with similar average preferences may generate very different results; hence it is hazardous to infer individual dispositions from aggregate outcomes or to assume that behavior was directed by ultimately agreed-upon norms. Suggested applications are to riot behavior, innovation and rumor diffusion, strikes, voting, and migration. Issues of measurement, falsification, and verification are discussed.

This article examines consensus, both in general and on various subjects, within and between important social groups at the beginning of the French Revolution 1789. On agenda, the subjects that a group chooses to discuss, there is evidence of national consensus. On program, the proposals of each group for action, the nobility and the Third Estate show significantly greater local than national consensus. The evidence also suggests that the country people, unlike the more elite groups, did not participate in national consensuscreating dialogue. Not surprisingly, the Thrid Estate's coming political triumph is anticipated by a higher level of Coherence than is shown by the nobility, but the difference is not nearly as great as one might expect.

Pugh	American Journal of Sociology	91	5	1986-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1170-1202	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Major delinquency theories differ significantly in the ways in which they have portrayed the friendship patterns of male and, more recently, female delinquents. Psychological studies and control theory have depicted delinquents' peer relationships as inadequate or exploitive and cold, whereas subcultural theories generally emphasize the intimacy and solidarity of the delinquent gang. In spite of its pivotal theoretical role, few studies have actually examined delinquents' friendships and the ways in which they differ from those of more conforming adolescents. Multiple dimensions of friendship are identified that allow examination of adolescents' perceptions of the rewards and vicissitudes of their relationships and the patterns of interaction and influence that characterize them. The data reveal many similarities in the friendship patterns of adolescents with significant differences in their levels of self-reported delinquency involvement and challenge the conception of female delinquents as socially disabled. These data suggest that both the "cold and brittle" and "intimate fraternity" images may have oversimplified the nature of of delinquents' friendship relations. Similarities and differences in the friendship styles of black and white respondents are also examined.

Labor-market location is less powerful in predicting income in Norway and Sweden where they have more inclusive employment policies. In Sweden, though, the labor-market variables are more important in explaining the income gap. Family effects (marital status and number of children) are weak everywhere but especially in Scandinavia. Nevertheless, because it is encouraged by policies designed to integrate employment and family, part-time paid work has a major effect on the gender gap in income in Norway and Sweden. Women, however, pay more of a penalty than men for part-time employment in North America.

This paper identifies major methodological and conceptual problems inherent in sentencing disparity research and presents and empirical analysis of the racial disparity argument for the years 1969, 1973, and 1977.

While Habermas deftly uses pragmatist insights into communicative rationality and democratic ethos, he shows little sensitivity to other facets of pragmatism. This article argues that incorporating the pragmatist perspective on experience and indeterminacy brings a corrective to the emancipatory agenda championed by critical theorists. The pragmatist alternative to the theory of communicative action is presented, with the discussion centering around the following themes: disembodied reason versus embodied reasonableness, determinate being versus indeterminate reality, discursive truth versus pragmatic certainty, rational consensus versus reasonable dissent, transcendental democracy versus democratic transcendence, and rational society versus sane community.

The effects of political and economic determinants are investigated with measures of economic inequality, political variables, and unemployment. The delayed effects of broken families are measured with a lagged moving average of out-of-wedlock births. The findings show that inequality due to the presence of the rich and past out-of-wedlock birth rates matter, but unemployment is not related to prison admissions. The strength of the Republican Party and a presidential election year dummy also explain shifts in incarcerations. The results suggest that earlier work omitted theoretically important explanations.

The Structure of the Kantian Core	Richard Munch	American Journal of Sociology	86	4	1981-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 709-739	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This essay presents the thesis that a correct understanding of Talcott Parson's writings must begin form the assumption of a fundamental congruence of basic structure and method between the theory of action and Kant's critical philosophy. It is already generally understood that this congruence holds true on the metalevel of epistemological assumptions. It is less understood that the Kantian form of argument penetrates down to the level of the object theory of the general theory of action. The core of action theory is the notion that concrete action is to be explained as a result of the inner laws and the characteristic interrelations of analytically distinct subsystems of action. Thus the Parsonian solution to the central problem of social order is not "utilitarian"; nor, however, is it in any simple sense "normative", as it is often taken to be. Parson's solution lies instead in the notion of the "interpenetration" of distinct subsystems of action. This notion of interpenetration is a derivative of Kantian transcendental philosophy. In this sense, a Kantian "core" structures the theoretical development must be understood as a progressive elaboration and refinement of this central core.

Levinger	American Journal of Sociology	81	5	1976-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1017-1049	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The elementary conditions of human interaction generate Michels's (1910) "iron law of oligarchy" and Mosca's (1896) major proposition on system size and ruling elites, the latter holding without regard to the definitional restrictions recently examined by Mayhew (1973). Specifically, the structure of focused face-to-face interaction constrains chance expectations for power relations. Power is constrained to equalize (by change alone) as interaction sequences increase in length. Power is constrained to polarize (by chance alone) as group size increases. Since interaction sequences falling within the operative range of human perception as specified by Miller (1956) and Simon (1974) are relatively short, power will be increasingly concentrated as a function of group size in most situations, yielding Michels's law and Mosca's proposition. As these regularities hold at much smaller sizes than originally specified by Michels (1911), their implications for macro-level control structures are examined in light of the results. It is concluded that control structures at the macro level are likely to be affected by considerations above and beyond those imposed by face-to-face (micro-level) interaction.

Biographical and textual evidence shows that Schutz's methodological goals for his first book, Der sinnhafte Aufbau der sozialen Welt (published in 1932), wereshaped by the epistemological debates within the Austrian school of economics, rather than some abstract and unmotivated attempt to "synthesize" Weber and Hussl. Schutz modified Weber's concepts of Verstehen and the ideal type to meet Austrian objections, and revised them further to comply with canons of reliability adopted from the logical empiricist theory of science, with which he was familiar through his friend Felix Kaufmann. The essay concludes with a depiction of Schutz's little-known program for the unification of the social sciences, whose origin can be traced to the same intelectual context.

It is necessary to distinguish among three levels of structure of a system: output structure, parameter structure, and process structure. With these concepts four basic types of change processes can be indentified: simple reproduction, extended reproduction, transition, and transformation. These are discussed and illustrated, as well as some important special cases such as dialectical change, overintegration, and catastrophe.

Leifer	American Journal of Sociology	87	1	1981-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 23-47	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Two models of political mobilization are examined. The developmental model stresses class-based dynamics and does not take the group formation behind mobilization to be problematic. The reactive ethnicity model concurs with the developmental model on the importance of class-based dynamics but contends that ethnic ties serve as facilitating conditions for mobilization in a cultural division of labor. A crucial test, one that differs from past efforts, is formulated and applied to British historical data. The test avoids the problem of overlapping class and ethnic interests in a cultural division of labor by treating ethnic ties as facilitating conditions, and not as interests. The resulting contextual formulation allows an unambiguous use of aggregate data and renders the problem of selecting an "outlet" (party) for ethnic interests irrelevant. Results show ethnic ties to be important, but their conjunction with economic disadvantage was not sufficient to trigger concerted political mobilization. A missing necessary component is hipothesized-a leadership component-that would allow more accurate prediction of the strength and direction of the means adopted to resist collective oppression (voting in national elections being one such means).

The data show that as income rises, people shift from comparisons based on the amount needed to "get along" to the amount needed to "get ahead," thereby producing a U-shaped relationship betweenn income levels and perceived underpayment. Moreover, this pattern is influenced by relative husband-wife earnings. As spouse's income increase, employed women feel less underpaid while employed men feel just the opposite-though couples with more egalitarian sex-role attitudes are less extreme in this response. Finally, the paper considers the implcations of Jasso's Law of Justice Evaluations, which says that the injustice of underpayment should be judged relative to average inocome levels. Women's perceived dollar underpayment is about the same as that for men. But given that they are at significantly lower average income levles than men, Jasso's Law suggests that the relative injustice for women is much greater.

Warner	American Journal of Sociology	96	6	1991-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1441-1463	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Sociologist have long been interested in the functions of deviance and crime for the social order. Following Durkheim, functionalists argue that crime or the reaction to it (punishment) brings people together, thereby building social solidarity and cohesiveness, which in turn decreases crime. Recently, theory and research on the fear of crime argue, to the contrary, that crime or the reaction to it (fear) does not bring people together; rather it constrains their social interaction, thereby undermining instead of building social solidarity and cohesiveness. Additionally, opportunity (routine-activities) theory and research suggest that constraining social interaction to safe sites and times limits the opportunities for crime. This article attempts to combine the fear-of-crime and opportunity (routine activities) research traditions in one model. The model first examined is a recursive one in which robbery constrains social interaction that affects other crimes. Then a nonrecursive model where robbery constrains social interaction that affects both other crimes and robbery is examined. Results suggest a model in which crime becomes stabilized through a negative feedback loop,as proposed by funcionalists, but through processes more akin to the proposed in routine-activities theory. As robbery increases, so does the fear of crime that constrains social interaction. Although possibly undermining social solidarity, this process constrains opportunities for crime, thereby decreasing both robbery and other crimes.

Efforts to formulate general theories of society devoid of historical limitation have created serious problems for theoretical work. This article examines two important examples of this tendency: Parson's and Schutz's use of Weberian sociology to derive general theories of social action. A historically grounded procedure for generating concepts was central to Weber's work. It united explanatory and interpretative analysis within a reflexive framework that responded to the intellectual and political interests of the theorist. Early writings of Parsons and Schutz surmount, in different ways, Weber's strictures on the limits of general theory by eliminating the historical component of Weber's thought. This development reversed Weber's theoretical achievement, decomposing his synthesis into hostile theories based on key fragments of his analysis.

Controlling for the economic constraints imposed by initial poverty and world-system position, we find that the school furthers economic development while exposure to the cinema hinders it. Further analysis shows that these effects vary by political context: in countries with mobilizing regimes, the positive contributions of the school are strong, while in countries with nonmobilizing regimes the adverse effects of the cinemaare strong. Following Portes, we argue that the cinema impedes economic growth by transmitting and promoting Western values incompatible with the social ethos that must accompany programs of national economic development. We discuss the relevance of our findings to the problem of social mobilization in poor countries.

In this study, social factors influencing the reputational status of research organizations in large-scale, cognitively diverse, multisectoral "technical systems" are examined. Data are drawn from interviews with personnel from a national U.S. sample of 50 organizations engaged in research on nuclear-waste management and 47 organizations involved in photovoltaics research. The reputational status of each organization was assessed by knowledgeable respondents from other organizations in each system. A model is presented that characterizes reputational status as a function of organizational performance, organizational structure, and network position. Support is obtained for the model by the use of both subjective and objective indicators, including evidence of the mediating effects of network position. Further results obtained from a blockmodel analysis indicate that ties to specific blocks are a more important determinant of reputational status than block membership.

The large number of contending explanations highlights the difficulty in comparative sociology of drawing confident conclusions when there are few cases to compare. This problem is addressed through diverse evidence-a review of the comparative historical record and a time-series analysis-to form a Bayesian prior distribution, which is combined with a cross-sectional data set to sharpen conventional estimates of economic and institutional effects. This analysis indicates working-class organization in trade unions expanded in the postwar period where labor acquired an institutional influence over capitalist labor markets.

Geerken	American Journal of Sociology	82	6	1977-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1289-1317	The University of Chicago Press	fla		A substantial body of literature indicates that (1) the tendency to yeasay or naysay, (2) the perception of the desirability or undesirability of a given trai, and (3) the need for social approval have a significant and independent impact on the statements made by respondents in surveys. Most investigatiors concerned with response bias appear to believe that these response bias variables act as a form of systematic bias which significantly distorts the relationship observed between an independent and a dependent variable. However, while the literature indicates such a distortion may occur, this has not been demonstrated. Drawing on the data from a national survey, we look at the effect of these three forms of response bias on the pattern of relationships among seven demographic variables (sex, race, education, income, age, marital status, and occupation) and three very different indicators of mental health (psychiatric symptons, self-esteem, and feelings of positive affect). The results lead to an almost unequivocal conclusion: the response bias variables have very little impact on the relationship, and it seems safe to conclude that these sources of response bias do not act in a systematic way to invalidate the pattern of observed relationships between mental health and common demographic variables.

In 1953 there was virtually no ideological traditionalism (although the modal response pattern was the most traditional one) but a significant number of ideologically egalitarian responses. Both kinds of ideological response had become more frequent by 1971. By 1976 the modal response was the ideologically egalitarian one, as the entire response distribution had shifted toward the egalitarian pole. Yet the highest ratio of ideological to situational responses was observed among the consistently traditional respondents. The trend in ideological traditionalism suggests that ideological justifications for traditional definitions of sex roles develop as a reaction to the emergence and promulgation of egalitarian ideologies.

This essay shows both accounts to be severely flawed. A simple model of the impact of urban networks on monetary circulation is developed; it argues that taking account of the effects of urganization and occupational specialization on the velocity of money provides a fuller understanding of the price revolution than explanations based simply on aggregate population growth or changes in the money supply due to an influx of American metals. Implications are drawn for accounts of inflation in both early modern Europe and the contemporary developing world.

Gurevitch	American Journal of Sociology	93	5	1988-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1179-1199	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The central assumption of phenomenological and related approaches holds that the possibility of mutual understanding and communication in interpersonal relations in contingent on the supposition of the sameness of self and other. Under this assumption, the otherness of the other is conceived as an obstacle to achieving mutual understanding. Thus, the categories of stranger and strangeness are not considered constitutive of interpersonal communication and, consequently, are analyzed either in terms of social role or as a methodological device. The present paper examines this assumption by focusing on the process of "making the other strange," which involves the disengagement of the other's presence from his or her familiar, taken-for-granted identity. The other is thereby rendered. "other," that is, opaque and irreducible in his individuality. This suspension of the taken-for-granted understanding opens up the possibility of a creative and critical search to understand the other and allows distinguishing among selves. Without this possibility, the picture of interpersonal communication remains incomplete. The discussion of the principles underlying this process and of its implications for an analytical account of interaction is followed by examples from everyday occurences of making strange.

That is, class position is viewed as a determinant of the extent to which education can be transformed into income, and thus it is hypothesized that much of the commonly observed racial difference in returns to education is a consequence of the distribution of racial groups into class categories. The results of the study strongly confirm this perspective: the differences in returns to education between black and white males largely disappear when the regression equations are run within class positions.

Savelsberg	American Journal of Sociology	99	4	1994-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 911-943	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Recent dramatic increases of criminal punishment in the United States and very different trends in the Federal Republic of Germany suggest a critique of basic sociological theory traditions. The article confronts structural-functionalist, Marxist, and legalistic approaches with these trends and suggests an alternative and more complex theory. Utilizing and ideal-typical comparison between the two countries, this article develops a set of interrelated hypotheses on the impact of the institutionalization of (a) knowledge production in the public, political, and academic sectors and (b) political and legal decision making on (c) macro outcomes of political and legal decision making. Using the case of criminal punishment, the article suggests new themes for theory development and empirical macro-sociological research. It also contributes to the understanding of current instabilities in the political process in the United States.

Changes in distributions of power can close some avenues of ideological autonomy and open others; thus actors will have varying degrees of control over different issues within a given ideology. In response to the rise of liberal states in 19th-century Europe, the papacy was forced to avoid sociopolitical issues if it was to avoid persistent church-state conflict. Gradually reformulating Catholic ideology within the limited structural autonomy they had, popes subordinated sociopolitical issues to more purely religious and moral issues while constructing a new ideological opposition to liberalism.
