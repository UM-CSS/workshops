Busch	American Journal of Sociology	111	3	2005-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 824-858	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Membership in certain intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), such as the World Trade Organization, has long been argued to stimulate trade. Yet, evidence linking IGOs to trade is mixed. The authors argue that identifying the influence of IGOs requires attention not only to the institutions IGOs enact, but also to the network through which they enact them. This approach allows them to demonstrate that trade between two countries increases by an average of 58% with every doubling of the strength of IGO connection between the countries. They also contribute to debates regarding the mechanisms through which structural relationships influence economic behavior by showing that substantial trade benefits occur not only through economic IGOs, but also through IGOs that were formed for social and cultural purposes, and that connections through IGOs that are organizationally strong have more impact than those through minimalist IGOs.

Participation in solidary groups has consequences for the social bases of politics, and the political salience of such groups is affected by social institutions that are independent of occupational structure. The first such institution is direct rule. Whereas indirect rule tends to promote class politics, direct rule favors cultural politics. Rapid expansion of direct rule since the 1960s has muted class politics and increased cultural politics. This relationship is not deterministic, however; other institutions can mitigate the effects of direct rule on the social bases of politics.

This problem is approached in two quite different ways. First, a potential conceptual and methodological weakness in all research that focuses on national occupational, rather than local job and organizational, processes is pointed out. Second, the implications of organizationally relevant social closure and gendered labor process theories for our understanding of wage determination models is developed. The gendered devaluation and specialized human capital theories, which are stressed by Tam and his critics, do not represent the entire story. We find that the sex composition effect on wages exists, but it is indirect and relatively weak, operating largely through lower access of typically female jobs to extensive training. There is no strong evidence for the existence of a more generic gendered labor process in these cross‐sectional data. The evidence for social closure processes in this article is limited to the gendered nature of access to on‐the‐job training.

Bengtson	American Journal of Sociology	103	2	1997-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 429-60	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The authors investigate the structure of intergenerational cohesion by examining social‐psychological, structural, and transactional aspects of adult child‐parent relations. The authors use latent class analysis to develop a typology based on three underlying dimensions of intergenerational solidarity: affinity, opportunity structure, and function. The same five types are found for relations with both mothers and fathers: tight‐knit, sociable, intimate but distant, obligatory, and detached. Relationship types are also differentiated by sociodemographic characteristics; relations with fathers and divorced parents tended to have the weakest cohesion. The authors conclude that adult intergenerational relationships in American families are structurally diverse but generally possess the potential to serve their members' needs.

Duncan	American Journal of Sociology	116	4	2011-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1154-89	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Moving to Opportunity (MTO) offered public housing residents the opportunity to move to low-poverty neighborhoods. Several years later, boys in the experimental group fared no better on measures of risk behavior than their control group counterparts, whereas girls in the experimental group engaged in lower-risk behavior than control group girls. The authors explore these differences by analyzing data from in-depth interviews conducted with 86 teens in Baltimore and Chicago. They find that daily routines, fitting in with neighborhood norms, neighborhood navigation strategies, interactions with peers, friendship making, and distance from father figures may contribute to how girls who moved via MTO benefited more than boys.

Kessler, Lisa Sanbonmatsu	American Journal of Sociology	114	1	2008-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 144-188	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Experimental estimates from Moving to Opportunity (MTO) show no significant impacts of moves to lower‐poverty neighborhoods on adult economic self‐sufficiency four to seven years after random assignment. The authors disagree with Clampet‐Lundquist and Massey's claim that MTO was a weak intervention and therefore uninformative about neighborhood effects. MTO produced large changes in neighborhood environments that improved adult mental health and many outcomes for young females. Clampet‐Lundquist and Massey's claim that MTO experimental estimates are plagued by selection bias is erroneous. Their new nonexperimental estimates are uninformative because they add back the selection problems that MTO's experimental design was intended to overcome.

A unique Swedish population-level database of university applications and individuals’ ranking of different programs is used to analyze class differences in preferences for different program characteristics. Compared to individuals from service class backgrounds, individuals from manual labor class backgrounds choose programs of shorter duration with lower grade point requirements located closer to their parents’ home. Children from the service class instead prefer programs with higher earnings risk and avoid nontraditional institutions. Taken together, the differences in degree choice lead to substantial differences in expected earnings levels and expected unemployment risks.

Telles	American Journal of Sociology	112	5	2007-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1383-1415	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article examines the naming practices of Hispanic parents who gave birth to children in Los Angeles County in 1995. The authors find that greater exposure to U.S. culture increases the chances of naming a child in English. However, they find that by giving children English names that are translatable into Spanish, U.S.‐born Hispanic parents are able simultaneously to assimilate while maintaining a connection to their ethnic origins. In addition, the authors find that attitudes favoring assimilation are particularly great when naming daughters. Immigrant Hispanic couples tend to give sons Spanish names, but they often give daughters English names without Spanish referents. These gender differences persist even among U.S.‐born Hispanics paired with non‐Hispanics. Among intermarried couples, father’s ethnicity has a disproportionately large influence in naming, especially for sons’ names. These findings have implications for how the assimilation process is gendered.

This article proposes a multilevel framework in which country differences in religious attendance are explained by contextual, individual, and cross‐level interaction effects. Hypotheses from different theories are simultaneously tested with data from 60 nations obtained from the European/World Values Surveys. Multilevel logistic regression analyses show that religious regulation in a country diminishes religious attendance and that there are only small negative effects of people's own education and average educational level of the country. Religious attendance is strongly affected by personal and societal insecurities and by parental and national religious socialization and level of urbanization. These theories explain 75% of the cross‐national variation in religious attendance.

Brown	American Journal of Sociology	116	2	2010-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 503-542	The University of Chicago Press	fla		To what extent does community context affect individuals’ social ties and levels of community attachment? The authors replicate Sampson’s multilevel version of Kasarda and Janowitz’s systemic model of community using data from a survey of nearly 10,000 people residing in 99 small Iowa communities. They improve on Sampson’s work by using multilevel statistical tools, better measurement of community attachment, and data from 99 actual communities. While the authors find general support for the systemic model, their results suggest that the community one lives in actually has little effect on one’s level of community attachment, calling into question many of the basic assumptions and findings of past community research.

Stolzenberg	American Journal of Sociology	107	1	2001-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 61-100	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article considers the effect of husbands’ and wives’ hours of work on each others’ health. Theoretical analysis focuses on gendering of health‐related behavior, the time needed to promote a spouse's salubrious behavior, and the effects of work hours on the availability of time for nonwork activities. Empirical analyses are based on 1986 and 1989 longitudinal U.S. data. Fewer than 40 hours of work per week by wives has no effect on husbands’ health, but more than 40 hours has substantial negative effect. Long work hours by husbands are not detrimental to wives’ health. Wives’ work hours shows no effect on their own health, but husbands’ work hours show strong positive effect on their own health. Methodological issues are considered.

Results indicate that profound racial and ethnic differences in proximity to industrial pollution persist when differences in individual education, household income, and other microlevel characteristics are controlled. Examination of underlying migration patterns further reveals that black and Latino householders move into neighborhoods with significantly higher hazard levels than do comparable whites and that racial differences in proximity to neighborhood pollution are maintained more by these disparate mobility destinations than by differential effects of pollution on the decision to move.

In this article, two explanations for this relationship are examined. One is that religious networks provide support. The other is that religious communities prohibit suicide. To examine these hypotheses, individual‐level data on suicide in the Netherlands from 1936 to 1973 are used. The results show that with an increase in the proportion of religious persons in a municipality, the chances of committing suicide decrease for every denomination in that municipality, as well as among nonchurch members. Furthermore, along with the secularization of Dutch society, the impact of religious composition on suicide wanes. These results contradict the network‐support mechanism and confirm the notion that religious communities have a general protective effect against suicide.

Each person in a group wants to participate only if the total number taking part is at least her threshold; people use a network to communicate their thresholds. People are strategically rational in that they are completely rational and also take into account that others are completely rational. The model shows first that network position is much more important in influencing the revolt of people with low thresholds than people with high thresholds. Second, it shows that strong links are better for revolt when thresholds are low, and weak links are better when thresholds are high. Finally, the model generalizes the threshold models of Schelling (1978) and Granovetter (1978) and shows that their findings that revolt is very sensitive to the thresholds of people “early” in the process depends heavily on the assumption that communication is never reciprocal.

In fact, however, at least three different techniques are used: nominal, ordinal, and narrative strategies of causal assessment. Focusing on recent works of comparative history, this article presents an evaluation of the strengths and limitations of each strategy. In addition, it considers the trade‐offs involved in combining two or more strategies. Finally, the article discusses the role of scholarly tastes and skills, the research question, and ongoing research cycles in shaping the methodological approach selected by investigators.

This literature has focused on prison and on the wide-reaching collateral consequences of a felony conviction. Despite the obvious importance of these findings, they capture only a portion of the criminal justice system’s operations. In most jurisdictions, misdemeanors, not felonies, constitute the bulk of criminal cases, and the number of such arrests is rising. This article explores a puzzling fact about New York City’s pioneering experiment in mass misdemeanor arrests: the preponderance result in no finding of guilt and no assignment of formal punishment. Drawing on two years of fieldwork, this article explores how the criminal justice system functions to regulate significant populations without conviction or sentencing. The author details the operation of penal power through the techniques of marking through criminal justice record keeping, the procedural hassle of case processing, and mandated performance evaluated by court actors to show the social control capacity of the criminal justice system.

In the context of Unnithan et al.’s integrated model of suicide and homicide, high suicide rates in the northern core and a predilection for violence against others in the southern periphery may be consistently interpreted in terms of theories of the civilizing process and internal colonialism. Alternative explanations of southern violence in 19th‐century France are explored and rejected, and additional theoretical applications are suggested.

Central to his hypothesis is that marriage is emotionally advantageous for men and disadvantageous for women. This article revisits this topic with data from the National Survey of Families and Households. The analyses indicate that the emotional benefits of marriage apply equally to men and women, but that men and women respond to marital transitions with different types of emotional problems. The implications of these findings for future research on gender and mental health are discussed.

This ecology nurtured many close–knit student networks, as well as directly exposed all Beijing students to a collective action environment when the movement started. These ecological conditions not only sustained a high rate of movement participation but also facilitated the formation of many ecology–dependent strategies of student mobilization, which in turn patterned the dynamics of the movement.

It shows that whites' stereotypes about Latino work ethic grow more positive as the size of the Latino population increases, suggesting positive effects of contact. Moreover, the effect of whites’ stereotypes about Latino—but not black—work ethic on support for welfare is contingent on ethnic context. In areas with few Latinos, the lazier whites think Latinos are, the less whites want to spend on welfare. However, in areas that are disproportionately Latino the more hardworking whites think Latinos are (controlling for whites' stereotypes about blacks), the less whites want to spend on welfare as well. This last result, this article argues, is the product of a social comparison between black and Latino work ethic.

Regarding parental investment, Triv‐ers and Willard use Darwinian reasoning to hypothesize that high‐status parents favor sons over daughters and that low‐status parents favor daughters over sons. The application of this hypothesis to contemporary societies has been widely accepted by sociobiolo‐gists, although it has received little actual empirical scrutiny. The Trivers‐Willard hypothesis is tested in this study using two nationally representative surveys of American adolescents and their parents. Across several different measures of investment, little evidence of the predicted parental investment behaviors is found. This article seeks not only to contribute to settling the empirical point at issue but also to encourage a renewed and empirically focused dialogue between sociologists and sociobiologists.

This model yields significant turnout, divergent platforms, and numerous results consistent with the rational calculus of voting model and the empirical literature on social turnout. In a simplified version of the model, the authors show how a local imitation structure inherently yields dynamics that encourage positive turnout. The model also generates new hypotheses about the importance of social networks and citizen‐party interactions.

But labor market structure and welfare state policies will create distinctive national patterns of labor force adjustment to shifts in technology, markets, and the consequent demand for particular forms of labor. In a four‐nation comparative study, U.S. rates of job mobility showed the greatest sensitivity to structural change and to the labor market resources of individual workers. The Netherlands was at the opposite pole, with worker outcomes largely insulated from structural forces. Germany's strong labor market boundaries channeled adjustment within sectors or between employment and nonemployment, while Sweden's pattern was intermediate between that of the United States and Germany.

The author identifies a novel explanation for these marital divides, namely, the important role of personal wealth in marriage entry. Using event-history models and data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort, the author shows that wealth is an important predictor of first marriage and that differences in asset ownership by race and education help to explain a significant portion of the race and education gaps in first marriage. The article also tests possible explanations for why wealth plays an important role in first marriage entry.

Results show a panethnic effect—greater residential proximity within panethnic boundaries than between, net of ethnic group size and metropolitan area—that is dependent on immigration. A lower degree of social distance between panethnic subgroups is observed for blacks, whites, and Latinos, and less for Asians, yet ethnonational groups continue to maintain some degree of distinctiveness within a racialized context.

Somers	American Journal of Sociology	104	3	1998-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 722-784	The University of Chicago Press	fla		An alarm has been sounded that historical sociology is subverting the theoretical aims of social science. Criticizing an array of widely influential scholars, Kiser and Hechter propose that rational choice theory can avoid the trend toward "empiricism" that results from the import of history into sociology. Their position is based on theoretical realism–a radically antipositivist thesis that uses ontological and theoretical postulates to theorize about reality beyond positive appearance. A close examination of theoretical realism casts doubts on the epistemological foundations of rational choice theory. Relational realism, the alternative introduced here, places greater emphasis on the pragmatic elements of explanation, supporting a more relational, causal‐historical, and problem‐driven view of theory. A renewed appreciation of what is defined as Kuhn's historical episte‐mology provides the foundation for evaluating these competing research programs.

Many accounts of this cumulative gender disadvantage attribute it to women’s underinvestment in firm‐specific skills. Yet if that were true, this disadvantage would not exist where firm‐specific skills are not rewarded by the labor market. This article investigates this argument in the context of contract employment, where demand for firm specificity is minimal. Contrary to expectations, men still receive higher rewards than women over time. Drawing on quantitative evidence and qualitative fieldwork using job histories of high‐skill contractors affiliated with a staffing firm, the author finds support for two sources of women’s disadvantage: lower rates of movement across clients on the supply side and unmeasured demand‐side factors by which similar levels of tenure and client transitions accrue lower rewards to women. Implications for research on gender stratification and career advancement in nonformalized labor markets are discussed.

The study first decomposes Theil's T to show that between-country inequality is the most significant component of overall world income inequality, which facilitates fruther research, as between-country longitudinal data are more easily available than national income distribution data. Next, the study uses a larger set of nations and finds a signigicant increase in world income inequality as measured by both Gini and Theil coefficients, particularly during the 1980s. The findings are robust even after controlling for differential rates of population growth or using alternative sources of data. By indentifying these trends, the article is able to explain past discrepancies and recent shifts in the relevant empirical and theoretical literature.

But blood must be collected as well as donated, and the organizational basis of the blood supply has been largely neglected. This article is a comparative study of blood collection regimes in Europe. Regimes are found to affect donation rates and donor profiles. When the Red Cross collects blood, donation is tied to religious activity and other volunteering, unlike state and blood bank systems. This study argues that collection regimes produce their donor populations by providing differing opportunities for donations. The analysis contributes to an institutional perspective on altruism and highlights the need to attend to the socially embedded nature of altruistic as well as self‐interested action.

Alderson, François Nielsen	American Journal of Sociology	114	4	2009-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1037-1101	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The upswing in economic inequality that has affected a number of advanced industrial societies in the late 20th century has been particularly conspicuous in the United States. The authors explore its causes using data on the distribution of family income in 3,098 U.S. counties in 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000. The authors build a model of within‐county income inequality that assumes that distribution processes involving labor market and sociodemographic variables operate primarily at the county level and those involving the political and institutional context operate primarily at the state level. Multilevel methods are used to distinguish county cross‐sectional, state cross‐sectional, and longitudinal effects on inequality. The authors find that, when features of the state‐level institutional and political context are associated with inequality, these effects are larger longitudinally than cross‐sectionally. A range of other factors, including economic development, labor force changes, shifts in the racial/ethnic and gender composition of the labor force, educational expansion, and urbanization are found to have comparatively large effects, both longitudinally and cross‐sectionally.

The authors study first the extent to which friendship ties that cross ethnic boundaries are associated with specific interaction spaces (neighborhoods, workplaces, civil society organizations, and political parties) and, second, the extent to which interethnic friendships are associated with trust and tolerance. Using individual-level data ( ) on interethnic contacts collected in 2006 in the two northern Iraqi cities of Erbil and Kirkuk, the authors show that people who spend time within ethnically heterogeneous interaction spaces are considerably more likely to have friendship ties that cross ethnic group boundaries and, in turn, also to express general social trust, interethnic trust, and tolerance toward outgroups.

Treiman	American Journal of Sociology	103	2	1997-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 391-428	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article examines the effects of social origins on educational attainment, using data from the 1982 census of the People's Republic of China. Analysis of intergenerational relationships in China using census data is possible because nearly half of Chinese adult men live with their fathers. The authors show that the educational attainment of men is highly egalitarian with respect to social origins and has become increasingly so over time. During the Cultural Revolution (1966‐76), the advantage of coming from an educated family or an intelligentsia or cadre family was drastically reduced. The weak association between father's socioeconomic status and son's educational attainment reflects massive state intervention.

Analysts argue that they did so in response to the feminization of the workforce. This study charts the spread of maternity leave policies between 1955 and 1985 in a sample of 279 organizations. Sex discrimination law played a key role in the rise of maternity leave policies. Building on neoinstitutional theory, this article explores how the separation of powers shapes employer response to law. Details of the law are often specified in administrative rulings‐the weakest link in the law because they can be overturned by the courts and by Congress. Yet an administrative ruling requiring employers with disability leave programs to permit maternity leave, which employers successfully fought in the courts, was at least as effective as the identical congressional statute that replaced it. In the American context, the legal vulnerability of administrative rulings can draw attention to them, thus making the weakest link in the law surprisingly powerful.

A framework of competing commitment predicts that new relationships affect remittances depending on the extent to which they substitute for the benefits provided by origin families. Analyses of data from urban migrants in Kenya show that serious nonmarital sexual partners substitute for psychosocial support from the rural family and that material transfers migrants give to these partners significantly reduce remittances. The findings have implications for the ways scholars conceive of competition, the nature of exchange, and substitution of support across intimate relationships.

As part of industrial reform, the Chinese government began in the mid‐1980s to encourage firms to form business groups with structural characteristics that promised to enhance financial performance and productivity. Using 1988‐90 panel data on China's 40 largest business groups and their 535 member firms, the study finds that the presence and predominance of interlocking directorates and finance companies in business groups improved the financial performance and productivity of the groups' member firms. In addition, firms in groups with nonhierarchical organizational structures performed better than firms in hierarchical groups, suggesting that complete integration into a hierarchical organization is not an optimal strategy.

Others argue that the idea of “expanding opportunities” needs to be balanced by consideration of political threats. An annual time‐series approach is used to examine the frequency of African‐American protest in the United States from 1948 to 1997. Evidence of expanding opportunities created by divided government, strong northern Democratic Party allies, and, during the 1950s, Republican presidential incumbents responding to Cold War foreign policy constraints is found. African‐American congressional representation provides routine political access, which reduces protest. The evidence also supports explanations based on collective grievances stemming from black/white income inequality, Vietnam War deaths, and low‐to‐middle black unemployment.

Burt	American Journal of Sociology	110	2	2004-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 349-399	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article outlines the mechanism by which brokerage provides social capital. Opinion and behavior are more homogeneous within than between groups, so people connected across groups are more familiar with alternative ways of thinking and behaving. Brokerage across the structural holes between groups provides a vision of options otherwise unseen, which is the mechanism by which brokerage becomes social capital. I review evidence consistent with the hypothesis, then look at the networks around managers in a large American electronics company. The organization is rife with structural holes, and brokerage has its expected correlates. Compensation, positive performance evaluations, promotions, and good ideas are disproportionately in the hands of people whose networks span structural holes. The between‐group brokers are more likely to express ideas, less likely to have ideas dismissed, and more likely to have ideas evaluated as valuable. I close with implications for creativity and structural change.

Goldthorpe	American Journal of Sociology	112	4	2007-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1095-1134	The University of Chicago Press	fla		In this article, the authors explore the social bases of cultural consumption by examining the association between newspaper readership and social status. They report a strong and systematic association between status and newspaper readership which is consistent with the expected link between status in the classical Weberian sense, on the one hand, and cultural level and lifestyle, on the other. This association persists in a multinomial logistic regression model in which the authors take into account, among other things, educational attainment which serves as a proxy for the respondent’s information‐processing capacity. The social status of respondent’s father and best friend also have significant and substantial effects on newspaper preference. Finally, the authors report results that indicate that the effects of status on newspaper readership are generally more important than those of class.

This article argues that this enduring regional hierarchy is a path‐dependent legacy of Spanish colonialism. Those territories that constituted the centers of the Spanish colonial empire tended to become the region’s least developed countries; by contrast, those territories that were peripheral to the Spanish empire tended to become the most developed countries. Using methods for assessing both correlational causation and necessary/sufficient causation, the article explores competing hypotheses to explain this inverse relationship. It finds that the density of the indigenous population and the strength of liberal elites during the period from 1700 to 1850 were critical factors linking colonial and postcolonial development.

PSID data are analyzed to reveal remarkable continuity in neighborhood economic status from one generation to the next. The primary consequence of persistent neighborhood stratification is that the racial inequality in America’s neighborhoods that existed a generation ago has been transmitted, for the most part unchanged, to the current generation. More than 70% of black children who grow up in the poorest quarter of American neighborhoods remain in the poorest quarter of neighborhoods as adults, compared to 40% of whites. The results suggest that racial inequality in neighborhood economic status is substantially underestimated with short‐term measures of neighborhood income or poverty and, second, that the steps taken to end racial discrimination in the housing and lending markets have not enabled black Americans to advance out of America’s poorest neighborhoods.

Martin	American Journal of Sociology	113	4	2008-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1067-1103	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Despite the growing interest in union organizing, there has been little effort to systematically describe the organizing landscape in America today. Institutionalization, which is an increasingly important concept in social movement theory, provides the framework for differentiating between the two major organizing repertoires presently available to unions: the traditional National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) certification election and more recent organizing that avoids the election process. Evidence from a sample of 70 large local unions from 1990 to 2001 reveals that, although the certification election continues to be the preferred method of membership recruitment, non‐NLRB organizing appears to be more effective, in terms of both victory rate and number of workers organized. The findings have implications for future research on labor unions and represent an important step toward an empirical understanding of processes of institutionalization within social movements generally.

The authors argue that adolescents’ social contexts are defined, in part, by clusters of students (termed “local positions”) who take courses that differentiate them from others. Using course transcript data from the recent Adolescent Health and Academic Achievement Study, the authors employ a new network algorithm to identify local positions in 78 high schools in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Incorporating the local positions into multilevel models of math coursetaking, the authors find that girls are highly responsive to the social norms in their local positions, which contributes to homogeneity within and heterogeneity between local positions.

This article addresses several gaps in our knowledge about the mechanisms linking structural conditions to social (dis)organization and the role of culture in this process. Relying on the case of a predominantly Puerto Rican housing project in Boston, it investigates changes in one aspect of social organization—participation in local community activities—suggesting the theory should incorporate the role of cohorts and cultural frames and rethink the relationship among structure, culture, and change.

Rational choice models cannot explain the seemingly irrational optimism of youth aspirations, pointing to the need to explore other alternatives. This article incorporates insights from pragmatist theory and cognitive sociology to examine the relationship between imagined futures and present actions and experiences in rural Malawi, where future optimism appears particularly unfounded. Drawing from in-depth interviews and archival sources documenting ideological campaigns promoting schooling, the author shows that four elements are understood to jointly produce educational success: ambitious career goals, sustained effort, unflagging optimism, and resistance to temptation. Aspirations should be interpreted not as rational calculations, but instead as assertions of a virtuous identity, claims to be “one who aspires.”

This article shows how social norms can be deductively derived from principles of (boundedly) rational choice as mechanisms that are necessary to stabilize behaviors in a large class of evolutionary games.

Evidence for these benefits has steadily accumulated. The authors ask whether those who strive for such structural advantages can maintain them if others follow their example. Burt speculates that they cannot, but a formal demonstration of this speculation is lacking. Using a game theoretic model of network formation, the authors characterize the networks that emerge when everyone strives for structural holes. They find that the predominant stable networks distribute benefits evenly, confirming that no one is able to maintain a structural advantage in the long run.

King	American Journal of Sociology	111	2	2005-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 579-616	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The institutionalization of distinct collective memories of hate and cultural traumas as law and bureaucracy is examined comparatively for the case of hate crime law. A dehistoricized focus on individual victimization and an avoidance of major episodes of domestic atrocities in the United States contrast with a focus on the Holocaust, typically in the context of the destruction of the democratic state, in Germany. Such differences, in combination with specifics of state organization and exposure to global scripts, help explain particularities of law and law enforcement along dimensions such as internationalization, coupling of minority and democracy protection, focus on individual versus group rights, and specialization of control agencies.

However, the female advantage in religiousness is not universal. Distinguishing affective (personal piety) from active (organizational participation) religiousness, in a third of nations (World Values Survey) women are no higher than men in active religiousness. Among Jews and Muslims worldwide, men are more religious than women. Combined, social factors actually explain much of the gender disparity in U.S. religiousness (General Social Survey); with personality, all of it in active religiousness. The author discusses implications for understanding gender.

The research site is the early thrift industry. Changes in thrifts' technical environment (the rise of a transient and heterogeneous population) and institutional environment (the rise of Progressivism) propelled this coevolutionary process. The coevolution of thrift organizations and institutions proceeded primarily through selection. Adaptation was constrained by both institutional factors (it was difficult to adopt a novel institutional logic) and technical factors (early thrifts were generally small, so entry and exit were easy).

Rudolph	American Journal of Sociology	107	4	2002-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 990-1064	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article analyzes data derived from the first detailed long‐term follow‐up of a sample of serious adolescent female delinquents and similarly situated males. Neither marital attachment nor job stability, factors frequently associated with male desistance from crime, were strongly related to female or male desistance. A symbolic‐interactionist perspective on desistance is developed as a counterpoint to Sampson and Laub’s theory of informal social control, and life history narratives are used to illustrate the perspective. This cognitive theory is generally compatible with a control approach but (a) adds specificity regarding underlying change mechanisms, (b) explains some negative cases, and (c) fits well with life course challenges facing contemporary serious female (and more provisionally male) offenders.

Kellogg	American Journal of Sociology	115	3	2009-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 657-711	The University of Chicago Press	fla		One of the great paradoxes of institutional change is that even when top managers in organizations provide support for change in response to new regulation, the employees whom new programs are designed to benefit often do not use them. This 15‐month ethnographic study of two hospitals responding to new regulation demonstrates that using these programs may require subordinate employees to challenge middle managers with opposing interests. The article argues that relational spaces—areas of isolation, interaction, and inclusion that allow middle‐manager reformers and subordinate employees to develop a cross‐position collective for change—are critical to the change process. These findings have implications for research on institutional change and social movements.

Qualitative historical evidence suggests the importance of classes—in particular, the emerging class of intellectuals—in the wave of democratizations in the decade before World War I. Quantitative cross‐national data on a more recent wave of democratizations, from 1989 to 1996, confirm these findings. Models using direct maximum‐likelihood estimation find that the ratio of adults with higher education has a significant positive effect on change in democracy levels, as measured by two longitudinal scales (Polity IV and Polyarchy). Proxies for the working class and the middle class—candidates proposed in previous studies as the social basis of democratization—also have significant effects.

Nagin	American Journal of Sociology	103	6	1998-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1593-1630	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article reviews questions about different categories of criminal careers, summarizes Poisson latent class regression models, describes procedures for evaluating the optimal number of latent classes, and applies this methodology to data from male cohorts taken from the cities of London, Philadelphia, and Racine. Four latent classes of offending careers is an appropriate number for the London cohort, but five classes can be justified for the Philadelphia data. In the case of the Racine cohorts, five classes may be detected for the 1942 and 1955 cohorts but only four for the 1949 cohort. Despite the varying numbers of latent offending classes, there clearly is a small number of typical age patterns.

This article uses a dynamic approach to model the determinants of single mothers' entry into and exit from productive activities. Using 14 waves of data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, the article shows that kin coresidence facilitates young single mothers' entry into productive activities but does not play a significant role in sustaining participation. Women's individual trainability, the local labor market conditions, child support, and some family background factors all play a role. The results also demonstrate the insignificance of race and never‐married versus ever‐married status.

The authors examine the role of resources, infrastructure, and leadership in tenant mobilization in the Los Angeles tenants’ rights movement between 1976 and 1979. Using survey and census data along with archival materials, they compare neighborhoods across Los Angeles and find a significant role for resources, infrastructure, and leadership; notably, the authors find that countermovement infrastructure and leadership are more important to renter mobilization than movement infrastructure and leadership.

Drawing on contact theory, this study tests whether school organization affects friendship segregation in a national sample of adolescent friendship networks. The results show that friendship segregation peaks in moderately heterogeneous schools but declines at the highest heterogeneity levels. As suggested by contact theory, in schools where extracurricular activities are integrated, grades tightly bound friendship, and races mix within tracks, friendship segregation is less pronounced. The generally positive relation between heterogeneity and friendship segregation suggests that integration strategies built on concentrating minorities in large schools may accentuate friendship segregation.

Podolny	American Journal of Sociology	107	1	2001-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 33-60	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article draws an analytical distinction between two types of market uncertainty: egocentric, which refers to a focal actor’s uncertainty regarding the best way to convert a set of inputs to an output desired by a potential exchange partner, and altercentric, which denotes the uncertainty confronted by a focal actor’s exchange partners regarding the quality of the output that the focal actor brings to the market. Given this distinction, the article considers how the value of “structural holes” and market status vary with these two types of uncertainty. The article proposes that the value of structural holes increases with egocentric uncertainty, but not with altercentric uncertainty. In contrast, the value of status increases with altercentric uncertainty, but declines with egocentric uncertainty. Thus actors with networks rich in structural holes should sort into markets or market segments that are high in egocentric uncertainty; high‐status actors should sort into markets that are low in egocentric uncertainty. Support for this claim is found in an examination of the venture capital markets.

These predictions receive support in two experiments conducted in the United States and Japan. The findings provide empirical support for the theory of trust that emhasizes the role of general trust (trust in others in general) in emancipating people fromt the confines of safe, but closed relationships. The results also offer a theoretical explanation for what have been viewed in the past as cultural differences.

Hannan	American Journal of Sociology	104	1	1998-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 126-164	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article explores the use of logical formalization to clarify an area of research characterized by conflicting claims and divergent empirical findings. The substantive focus concerns the relation between organization age and the hazard of mortality. The literature contains claims that the hazard (a) falls with age (a “liability of newness”), (b) rises initially and then falls with age (a “liability of adolescence”), (c) rises with age (“liabilities of senescence and obsolescense”). The formalizations reported cast the relevant theoretical arguments as propositions involving five concepts: endowment, imprinting, inertia, capability, and position. It shows that each of the theoretical stories can be derived as implications of particular assumptions within two broad formalizations. This analysis clarifies the mechanizms at work in each theoretical account and provides guidance for expirical research designed to discriminate among the competing theories.

This work investigates a rarely studied mobilization of U.S. women in the first half of the 20th century to explore how movement organizations bring about legal change. Archival data for 15 states are examined to investigate how women won the right to sit on juries. The authors argue that jury movement activists engaged in strategic adaptation were more likely to win a change in jury laws rapidly. Those not engaged in such strategic action won their reforms more slowly. The authors suggest that when social movement actors tailor their actions to respond to exigencies in the environment they are more likely to expedite political success.

Gould	American Journal of Sociology	107	5	2002-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1143-1178	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article offers a formal theoretical model of the emergence of hierarchy that bridges the division between individualistic and structuralist accounts of inequality. In the model, actors reproduce status hierarchies by adjusting their own status‐conferring gestures according to collective attributions. These collective attributions are just the aggregate of individual gestures, leading to a self‐reinforcing status ranking. Winner‐take‐all hierarchies are discouraged, however, when people prefer reciprocation of their status‐conferring actions. The model therefore depicts a status ranking as an equilibrium resulting from individual responses to the trade‐off between social influence and the distaste for making unreciprocated gestures. Analysis of the model generates several precise predictions about the patterns that social networks should exhibit at equilibrium. Data on interaction in task groups, friendship ratings in a fraternity, and play in a set of infant quintuplets is used to show that the formal theory makes unusually accurate predictions about network structure.

Cooperative institutions offer a key to understanding cross–national variation among the affluent capitalist democracies in both facets of political economic performance. These institutions cluster along two dimensions: neocorporatism and firm–level cooperation. Pooled time–series analysis for 18 nations over 1960––89 suggests that (1) neocorporatism is a major source of distributive/redistributive policies and outcomes and of several sources of collective gain; (2) firm–level cooperation is a key contributor to economic growth.

This article uses log‐linear models and data from the March Current Population Survey to describe trends in the association between spouses' earnings and estimate their contribution to growing earnings inequality among married couples from 1967 to 2005. The results indicate that increases in earnings inequality would have been about 25%–30% lower than observed in the absence of changes in the association, depending on the inequality measure used. Three components of these changes and how they vary across the earnings distribution are explored.

Prior considerations of this question possess three weaknesses: underdeveloped theories with limited causes of liberations, impressionistic empirical analysis, and neglect of rural liberations. The author links two types of social shocks to liberations through quantitative analysis of all liberations granted by masters in Brunswick County, Virginia, from 1782 to 1862. Manumission deterrents and generators explain the rates at which manumission documents were written and chattels were freed. The antebellum pattern of white domination and black subordination disclosed in this research sheds light on the role racial ideologies have played in black‐white relations during the postbellum era and the social conditions under which whites have acceded to blacks’ demands for improvements in their status.

Sutton	American Journal of Sociology	104	2	1998-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 441-476	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Since the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, federal policy has revolutionized employment rights. Equal employment opportunity law, occupational safety and health legislation, and fringe benefits regulation were designed to create employee rights to equal protection, to health and safety, and to the benefits employers promise. In event‐history analyses of data from 279 organizations, this research finds that these legal changes stimulated organizations to create personnel, antidiscrimination, safety, and benefits departments to manage compliance. Yet as institutionalization proceeded, middle managers came to disassociate these new offices from policy and to justify them in purely economic terms, as part of the new human resources management paradigm. This pattern is typical in the United States, where the Constitution symbolizes government rule of industry as illegitimate. It may help to explain the long absence of a theory of the state in organizational analysis and to explain a conundrum noted by state theorists: the federal state is administratively weak but normatively strong.

Networks of this kind have received little attention, yet they appear to be widespread in the social and natural sciences, as is indicated here by three distinct examples. Furthermore, small admixtures of randomness to an otherwise ordered network can have a dramatic impact on its dynamical, as well as structural, properties‐a feature illustrated by a simple model of disease transmission.

Menchik, Xiaoli Tian	American Journal of Sociology	114	2	2008-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 332-370	The University of Chicago Press	fla		E‐mail excludes the multiple nonlinguistic cues and gestures that facilitate face‐to‐face communication. How, then, should interaction in a text‐based context be understood? The authors analyze the problems and solutions experienced by a research panel that communicated over e‐mail and face‐to‐face for 18 months, evaluating both kinds of exchanges alongside survey and interview data. Semiotic and linguistic theory is used to expose essential properties associated with the successful communication of meaning in each context. The authors find that e‐mail requires the cultivation of new techniques for specifically conveying the “pragmatic information” that connects the meaning of words to their users. Such information is assigned in e‐mail through the use of what are termed emphatic, referential, and characterizing semiotic tactics. These tactics are also evident in sustained online interactions studied by other researchers.

Aven	American Journal of Sociology	117	2	2011-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 484-538	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Emergent economies suffer from underdeveloped market infrastructures and insufficient public institutions to enforce contract commitments and property rights. Informal reputation-based arrangements may substitute for government enforcement, but they require close-knit networks that enable monitoring. Economic development also requires access to capital, information, and other resources, which is enabled by wide-reaching and diverse networks and not by closure. How is entrepreneurship possible given these conflicting demands? In this article, the authors examine how partnership networks and reputation channel the mobilization of capital for new enterprises, using quantitative information on 4,172 corporate partnerships during the industrialization of late imperial Russia (1869–1913). They find that reputation is locally effective in small and homogeneous network components. By contrast, founders in the largest components that form the network core raise more capital from investors but benefit less from reputation and more from brokerage opportunities and ties that reach diverse communities.

The authors introduce a multidimensional framework for analyzing the effectiveness of civic associations in terms of public recognition, member engagement, and leader development. Using original surveys of local Sierra Club organizations and leaders, the authors assess prevailing explanations in organization and movement studies alongside a model highlighting leadership and internal organizational practices. Although available resources and favorable contexts matter, the core findings show that associations with more committed activists, that build organizational capacity, that carry out strong programmatic activity, and whose leaders work independently, generate greater effectiveness across outcomes.

Individuals choose whether to innovate or imitate, and in the latter case, from whom to learn. The probabilities of these possible actions respond to an individual’s past experiences using reinforcement learning. Among some of the authors’ more interesting findings is that a population’s performance is not monotonically increasing in either the reliability of the communication network or the productivity of innovation.

The essay focuses on one particular moment in the evolution of a ghetto‐based street gang, namely its attempt to “corporatize” by accumulating revenues in underground economies, in order to demonstrate that neither the structure nor the practices of the street gang can be understood apart from the social organizational context of the larger community it inhabits.

Received novelty then depends on whether (a) the information overlap is small enough, (b) alters’ topical knowledge is shallow enough, and (c) alters’ knowledge stocks refresh slowly enough to justify bridging structural holes. Social network and e-mail content from an executive recruiting firm show that bridging ties can actually offer less novelty for these reasons, suggesting that the strength of weak ties and structural holes depend on brokers’ information environments.

The role of the mixed‐race category as either a “buffer class” or a status threat depended on the class composition of whites. Black/mulatto occupational differentiation was greatest where whites had high occupational prestige and thus little to fear from a mulatto group. Furthermore, differentiation increased the risk of lynching where whites had relatively low status and decreased the risk of lynching where whites had relatively high status.

The authors argue that peasant contention results from the position of the village in the regional structure, with village‐level organization providing the means for contention. The article uses court records to reconstruct the formal and informal networks within and across villages in western Anatolia. Under conditions of state and market expansion, those villages in intermediate positions in the regional structure tend to experience the vagaries of these changes more than central or isolated villages. Those intermediate villages are also most prone to contention. Cooperative village organization is also found to promote contention.

They find that racial homophily dominates mate-searching behavior for both men and women. A racial hierarchy emerges in the reciprocating process. Women respond only to men of similar or more dominant racial status, while nonblack men respond to all but black women. Significantly, the authors find that education does not mediate the observed racial preferences among white men and white women. White men and white women with a college degree are more likely to contact and to respond to white daters without a college degree than they are to black daters with a college degree.

First, an analytic frame linking tie strengths to defining principles, relational properties, and interactions is constructed and applied to changes in life insurance transactions in China. The data suggest that strong tie transactions were common until the economic gains of the sellers were made public. The author argues that the ethical‐affective principle that defines strong ties and the high intensity of trust, affection, and asymmetric obligation that constitute these ties make them a double‐edged sword for economic transactions. Instead, ties with midrange or weak strength are more effective because of their relational complementarity (although direct economic exchanges may take place among strong ties under extreme institutional or contingency conditions). The author also reveals that dramaturgical interactions, through which economic actors exercise their agency, are an integral part of embedded transactions.

Cela‐Conde, Maxi San Miguel	American Journal of Sociology	110	4	2005-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 977-1008	The University of Chicago Press	fla		By means of extensive computer simulations, the authors consider the entangled coevolution of actions and social structure in a new version of a spatial Prisoner’s Dilemma model that naturally gives way to a process of social differentiation. Diverse social roles emerge from the dynamics of the system: leaders are individuals getting a large payoff who are imitated by a considerable fraction of the population, conformists are unsatisfied cooperative agents that keep cooperating, and exploiters are defectors with a payoff larger than the average one obtained by cooperators. The dynamics generate a social network that can have the topology of a small world network. The network has a strong hierarchical structure in which the leaders play an essential role in sustaining a highly cooperative stable regime. But disruptions affecting leaders produce social crises described as dynamical cascades that propagate through the network.

O'Brien University of Oregon Political or threat explanations for the state's use of internal violence suggest that killings committed by the police should be greatest in stratified jurisdictions with more minorities. Additional political effects such as race of the city's mayor or reform political arrangements are examined. The level of interpersonal violence the police encounter and other problems in departmental environments should account for these killing rates as well. Tobit analyses of 170 cities show that racial inequality explains police killings. Interpersonal violence measured by the murder rate also accounts for this use of lethal force. Separate analyses of police killings of blacks show that cities with more blacks and a recent growth in the black population have higher police killing rates of blacks, but the presence of a black mayor reduces these killings. Such findings support latent and direct political explanations for the internal use of lethal force to preserve order.

Drawing on structural and organizational theories of the workplace, the authors demonstrate how organizational conditions affect workers’ and regulatory agents’ understandings of unlawful discrimination. Using a national sample of work establishments, matched to discrimination‐charge data obtained from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the authors examine how characteristics of the workplace and institutional environment affect variation in the incidence of workers’ charges of sex and race discrimination and in the subset of discrimination claims that are verified by EEOC investigators. The findings indicate that workplace conditions, including size, composition, and minority management, affect workers’ charges as well as verified claims; the latter are also affected by institutional factors, such as affirmative action requirements, subsidiary status, and industrial sector. These results suggest that internal workplace conditions affect both workers’ and regulatory agents’ interpretations of potentially discriminatory experiences, while institutional conditions matter only for regulatory agents’ interpretations of those events.

These characteristics (leptokurtosis and clustered volatility) have two important consequences: first, they also appear in suitably structured agent‐based models where, like real social actors, agents are socially embedded and metastable; second, their presence precludes the use of many standard statistical techniques like the chi‐square test. These characteristics in time‐series data indicate that a suitable agent‐based model rather than a standard statistical model will be appropriate. This is illustrated with an agent‐based model of mutual social influence on domestic water demand. The consequences for many frequently used statistical techniques are discussed.

The analysis provides little                     support for the social capital and neo‐Tocquevillian perspectives but                     strong support for the social movements notion that one of the predominant                     political influences of associationalism, at least in late                     19th‐century American cities, was that of interest group mobilization                     in support of specific municipal appropriations and party platforms.

This question is addressed through comparative analysis of the emergence of human rights organizations under military dictatorships in Chile, Uruguay, and Argentina. While severe state repression is expected to lead to generalized demobilization, these cases reveal that repression may directly stimulate collective action. The potential for sustained collective action in high‐risk contexts depends upon the relationship between strategies of repression and the particular configuration of embedded social networks; it is more likely where dense yet diverse interpersonal networks are embedded within broader national and transnational institutional and issue networks.

Beginning in the late 1970s, these cultural norms came into direct confrontation with the state birth control policy. Pitched against each other are the antinatalist laws backed by the powerful and unyielding state apparatus on the one side and the ancient pronatalist norms backed by revived lineage networks on the other. Even though the draconian state policies did succeed in dramatically reducing the overall birthrates, data analyses show that villages with strong kinship networks tend to have higher birthrates. The findings demonstrate the normative capacity of social networks to bend the iron bars of formal institutions. A general framework is developed for analyzing the roles of social networks in four ideal-typical juxtapositions of formal and informal institutions: normativism, legalism, congruence, and conflict.

Have different rates of population growth played a significant role in the trend? Have large nations dominated the trend? Are the results robust over different inequality measures and different income series? Two findings stand out. First, different rates of population growth in rich and poor nations played the predominant role in determining change in the distribution of per capita income across nations. Second, the centuries‐old trend of rising inequality leveled off from 1960 to 1989. The dependency theory thesis of a polarizing world system receives no support.

Carruthers	American Journal of Sociology	112	4	2007-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1135-1202	The University of Chicago Press	fla		For the past 15 years an enormous enterprise of global norm making and related national lawmaking has been underway in many areas of global commerce. This article shows that leading global institutions, such as the World Bank, IMF, and United Nations, are building an international financial architecture with law—including corporate bankruptcy law—as its foundation. Building on research on international institutions and three national cases (China, Indonesia, Korea), the authors propose a new framework for legal change in a global context—the recursivity of law. They argue that the globalization of bankruptcy law has proceeded through three cycles: (1) at the national level through recursive cycles of lawmaking, (2) at the global level through iterative cycles of norm making, and (3) at the nexus of the two. Recursive cycles are driven by driven by four mechanisms—the indeterminacy of law, contradictions, diagnostic struggles, and actor mismatch. Thus the recursivity of law both revives and expands the sociological theory of legal change and offers a basis for an integrated theory of globalization and law.

Sgourev	American Journal of Sociology	111	5	2006-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1327-1366	The University of Chicago Press	fla		We gain insight into the reasons why capitalists maintain social relationships with one another by analyzing a largely unexamined type of relationship—that which links “parallel peers” or noncompeting enterprises in the same industry—and an institution—the industry peer network or IPN—that is specifically designed for supporting small, exclusive groups of parallel peers. A wide array of qualitative and quantitative data show parallel relationships in general, and IPNs in particular, to be surprisingly prevalent, especially in light of the focus of past research on horizontal and vertical relationships and institutions. In addition, analysis of parallel relationships and the institutions that cultivate them sheds light on key mechanisms by which capitalist enterprises learn from one another and motivate one another to achieve higher performance.

Contrary to the standard assumption that selection is a simple function of challenging movement characteristics, this study suggests that selection is a matter of organizational correspondence: the extent to which a particular organizational model fits (a) the counterframed threat of the challenging movement, (b) the broader field of counterframed cultural‐political threats, (c) the characteristics of those embedded in countermobilizing networks, and (d) openings in the political structure. This argument is illustrated with primary data and secondary sources that allow a historical reconstruction of independent capitalist militia formations in Cleveland, Ohio, at the dawn of the Gilded Age.

Meeting this goal requires bringing historical sociology and interactionism into greater conversation via a historical theory of social situations. Toward this end, the authors of this article draw on Erving Goffman's work in Frame Analysis to conceptualize experience in social situations as grounded in multilayered cognitive frames and to demonstrate how such a framework helps illuminate historical changes in situated interaction.

Carroll	American Journal of Sociology	113	5	2008-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1272-1315	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article examines the classic question of how religious diversity in a community affects church membership in a period of high growth and social change. Using panel data on local U.S. communities from 1890 to 1926, the authors estimate models specified to overcome likely artifactual problems, deal with unobserved community‐specific heterogeneity, and model state dependence. In general, the findings support the plausibility of mechanisms based on pluralistic deobjectivation and identity activation; they do not support predictions from mechanisms based on organization‐environment matching and interdenominational competition. The findings also show that the overall effect of urbanization on church participation was positive in all but the most religiously diverse communities.

For the United States, it has been established that within‐job wage discrimination no longer is a major source of wage differences, while valuative discrimination potentially is. Less known is the role of allocative discrimination, especially in the hiring process, which we identify as the point where discrimination is most feasible. Our analysis uses personnel data on all entrants into a large U.S. service organization in the period 1978–86, focusing on managerial, administrative, and professional employees. We study the placement at initial hire and then follow job levels, wages, promotions, as well as departures, in years subsequent to hire.

Guglielmo	American Journal of Sociology	118	2	2012-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 327-379	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Contemporary race and immigration scholars often rely on historical analogies to help them analyze America’s current and future color lines. If European immigrants became white, they claim, perhaps today’s immigrants can as well. But too often these scholars ignore ongoing debates in the historical literature about America’s past racial boundaries. Meanwhile, the historical literature is itself needlessly muddled. In order to address these problems, the authors borrow concepts from the social science literature on boundaries to systematically compare the experiences of blacks, Mexicans, and southern and eastern Europeans (SEEs) in the first half of the 20th century. Their findings challenge whiteness historiography; caution against making broad claims about the reinvention, blurring, or shifting of America’s color lines; and suggest that the Mexican story might have more to teach us about these current and future lines than the SEE one.

The authors ask how well this promise has been fulfilled in the United States and Britain from 1993 to 2003. They examine two aspects of poverty vulnerability during this period of welfare reform: (1) its persistence and associated risk factors and (2) the efficacy of social transfers. After accounting for measurement error, sociodemographic characteristics, and the impact of redistributive programs, the authors find that poverty is often persistent and risk is concentrated, especially in the United States. Moreover, the British safety net appears to better protect those at risk.

Soule, Yvonne Zylan	American Journal of Sociology	103	3	1997-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 733-762	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Displeased with the increasing expenditures on ADC/AFDC and the changing demographic composition of the recipient population, state managers between 1950 and 1967 attempted to restrict the program. One way this was accomplished was through enacting work requirements as a condition of eligibility. Temporal variation in the enactment may be explained through a synthesis of two theoretical traditions on policy development: the intrastate and interstate approaches. The authors use diffusion models to examine how both sets of processes affected the rate of enactment of work requirements. States reformed AFDC programs in response to their own internal problem pressures. But this did not happen in a vacuum; work requirements diffused among states that were culturally and/ or institutionally linked.

First, Charles S. Peirce’s semiotic approach offers ethnographers a useful foundation for a mechanism-based approach to causality by tracing iterations of meaning-making-in-action. Second, taking advantage of the structure of Peirce’s semiotics ethnographers can examine three forms of observed variation to distinguish regularly occurring causal sequences and temporally and spatially remote causal processes. Third, the authors emphasize that the standards to evaluate causal arguments—their plausibility and assessments of explanatory fit—are always made in relation to challenges provided within a disciplinary community of inquiry. The use-value of the pragmatic approach to causality is demonstrated with an explanation of the different reactions of parents and clinicians to positive newborn screening results.

We examine popular explanations for indigenous or Afrodescendant disadvantage in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, and Peru using the 2010 AmericasBarometer survey. Findings show that numerical majorities across all countries endorse structural-disadvantage explanations and reject victim-blaming stances; in seven of eight countries, they specifically recognize discrimination against ethnoracial minorities. Brazilians most point to structural causes, while Bolivians are least likely to recognize discrimination. While educational status differences tend to be sizable, dominant and minority explanations are similar. Both are comparable to African-American views and contrast with those of U.S. whites.

Building off theories of temporality and action, the authors map three different modes of future making—protentions, trajectories, and temporal landscapes—that actors need to coordinate in order to make sense of action together. Using a wide range of empirical evidence, they then show that these modes of future-coordination are autonomous from each other, so that although they are connected, they can clash or move in disjointed directions in interaction. By focusing on the coordination and disjunctures of those three modes, the authors argue that sociologists can provide a methodological axis of comparison between cases; depict mechanisms through which other theoretical or empirical constructs—such as racism or late modernity—operate; and open a window into the ways in which people organize and coordinate their futures, a topic of inquiry in its own right.

A mesolevel network is a social network that differs in three important respects from interpersonal microlevel networks directly linking prior and potential adopters of a practice to one another: (1) it is generated by a different causal process than the microlevel network; (2) it tends to be much sparser than the microlevel network; and (3) the typical edge of a mesolevel network bridges much longer sociometric and geographic distances than the typical edge of a microlevel network. These types of mesolevel networks are important because they can dramatically influence the speed at which a contagious practice will diffuse. The mesolevel network focused upon in this article is the network that emerged out of the travel routes of political agitators affiliated with the Social Democratic Party. Computational modeling shows that the diffusion of the Social Democratic Party is likely to have been considerably influenced by the structure of this network. Empirical analyses of the founding of party organizations during the period 1894–1911 support these theoretical predictions and suggest that this mesolevel network was of considerable importance for the diffusion of the Swedish Social Democratic Party.

This article lays a foundation for systematic historical inquiry into the primitive accumulation of symbolic power by modernizing states. It introduces an analytical framework for research on how new domains of administrative activity become recognized as legitimate state practices. This framework is deployed to analyze how a popular revolt in northeastern Brazil managed to frustrate the Brazilian state’s attempt to implement civil registration in the mid‐19th century. The conclusion considers broad implications of this analysis for students of modern state formation and suggests the need for comparative historical analyses that historicize the naturalization of state power.

This article first identifies pure-generalized exchange in which each actor gives resources to the recipient(s) of his choice. Then, it proposes the fairness-based selective-giving strategy. An actor adopting this strategy selects a recipient whose behaviors satisfy her criterion of fairness, provided perfect information is given. The results of evolutionary simulation show that pure-generalized exchange can emerge among egoists without collective norms, even in societies in which individuals have information only about their immediate neighbors.

Bearman, Hannah Brückner	American Journal of Sociology	107	5	2002-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1179-1205	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The etiology of human same‐sex romantic attraction is generally framed in terms of (1) social influences, (2) genetic influences, or (3) hormonal influences. In this article, we show that adolescent males who are opposite‐sex twins are twice as likely as expected to report same‐sex attraction; and that the pattern of concordance (similarity across pairs) of same‐sex preference for sibling pairs does not suggest genetic influence independent of social context. Our data falsify the hormone transfer hypothesis by isolating a single condition that eliminates the opposite‐sex twin effect we observe—the presence of an older same‐sex sibling. We also consider and reject a speculative evolutionary theory that rests on observing birth‐order effects on same‐sex orientation. In contrast, our results support the hypothesis that less gendered socialization in early childhood and preadolescence shapes subsequent same‐sex romantic preferences.

Drawing on primary documents from the IMF archive and secondary literature, the author argues that these early trends were fostered by dynamics familiar to organizational sociologists. Because organizations are designed by architects possessing bounded rationality, they must adapt to circumstances unforeseen at their founding. They may also be pushed in unexpected directions by the influential actors in their environments, the power of professionals, and the propensity to routinization. International regimes, which are partly made up of organizations, may therefore be prone to internal contradictions.

Steinberg	American Journal of Sociology	105	3	1999-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 736-780	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article offers a critique of framing perspectives on collective action discourse and an alternative dialogic approach. The argument set forth is that the latter sees collective action discourse as a joint product of actors' agency and discourse dynamics, including its multivocal nature. Such discourse is a joint product of challengers' rational actions and the constraints of the discursive field. Challengers seek to appropriate and subvert the dominant discourses that legitimate power, creating discursive repertoires. To illustrate this, the contentious actions of English cotton spinners in the 1820s and 1830s are analyzed. The spinners produced a discursive repertoire drawing on mill owners' dominant discourses.

The study’s key theoretical insight is that the organizational decoupling required for successful commercialization may complicate companies’ ability to gain employee acceptance. Rich ethnographic data from Motherhood, Inc., an organization offering support and services for new mothers, is leveraged to identify two conditions under which employee resistance may arise and undermine successful commercialization. This article contributes to sociological understandings by theorizing the important role of employees in commercialization and to organizational theory more generally by specifying conditions under which decoupling may be difficult to achieve.

Treiman	American Journal of Sociology	113	2	2007-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 415-445	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Data from a 1996 national probability sample of Chinese men is used to analyze the effect of family background on occupational mobility in contemporary China, with particular attention to the rural‐urban institutional divide. China has an unusually high degree of mobility into agriculture and also, apparently, unusual “openness” in the current urban population. Both patterns are explained by China’s distinctive population registration system, which simultaneously fails to protect rural‐origin men from downward mobility and permits only the best educated to attain urban registration status, resulting in severe sample selection bias in previous studies restricted to the urban population. New light is shed on the relationships between the socialist state and social fluidity and between inequality and mobility.

Connections to (mainly) U.S.‐based standards of work and professional practice are routinely used in the local competition whereby different professional segments and groups seek to assert their authority on particular jurisdictions (scientific, corporate, or political). In this process of professional construction (or reconstruction), economies are being transformed through complex transnational mechanisms which, ultimately, feed back into the identity and jurisdictional claims of the economics profession itself, both in the “core” and in the “periphery.”

Institutional changes associated with the Soviet collapse increased the use of networks and shaped their prevalence and benefits in theoretically coherent ways. In Russia, networks positively affect job quality, whether measured by occupation, current earnings, or wage arrears. These findings relate to recent debates over whether job contacts provide advantages and how social capital relates to postsocialist inequalities involving gender, Communist Party membership, and education. Russia also exhibits a previously overlooked relationship between network use and locality type.

Papachristos	American Journal of Sociology	115	1	2009-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 74-128	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Most sociological theories consider murder an outcome of the differential distribution of individual, neighborhood, or social characteristics. And while such studies explain variation in aggregate homicide rates, they do not explain the social order of murder, that is, who kills whom, when, where, and for what reason. This article argues that gang murder is best understood not by searching for its individual determinants but by examining the social networks of action and reaction that create it. In short, the social structure of gang murder is defined by the manner in which social networks are constructed and by people's placement in them. The author uses a network approach and incident‐level homicide records to recreate and analyze the structure of gang murders in Chicago. Findings demonstrate that individual murders between gangs create an institutionalized network of group conflict, net of any individual's participation or motive. Within this network, murders spread through an epidemic‐like process of social contagion as gangs evaluate the highly visible actions of others in their local networks and negotiate dominance considerations that arise during violent incidents.

This article analyzes 80 biology textbooks published from 1952 to 2002 to reveal that U.S. biology texts have pursued the topic of race with renewed vigor in recent years. Moreover, textbooks have redefined race as genetic without furnishing empirical evidence for this framing. The textbooks’ transformation sheds light on the broader relationship between race and science in the United States, where claims about racial difference have not only drawn instrumentally and selectively from empirical research, but at times forgo scientific grounding altogether. As the textbooks show, both the tight and the loose linkage of race to science can preserve the cultural authority of the race concept. The texts also make clear that race is not a one‐time construct or a relic of centuries past. Instead, it is continually remade—and is being reworked today—suggesting its dynamic adaptation for ongoing use as a fundamental tool of social stratification.

Analyzing Wal‐Mart, the authors find support for their theory that companies respond to this uncertainty through a “test for protest” approach. In Wal‐Mart’s case, this consists of low‐cost probes in the form of new store proposals. They then withdraw if they face protests, especially when those protests signal future problems. Wal‐Mart is more likely to open stores that are particularly profitable, even if they are protested. This uncertainty‐based account stands in sharp contrast to full‐information models that characterize protests as rare miscalculations.

It first elaborates a theoretical argument that explains the effect of events and points to economic conditions, the size of the immigrant population, and personal contact as mediating factors. This argument is evaluated using the fact that the terror attack in Bali on October 12, 2002, occurred during the fieldwork period of the European Social Survey. The findings from this natural experiment reveal considerable cross-national and regional variation in the effect of the event and its temporal duration. The analysis on the regional level supports the argument about contextual variations in the response to the event and a second analysis based on the 2004 Madrid bombing confirms the study’s conclusions. Implications of the findings for societal responses to terror attacks, the literature on attitudes toward immigrants, and survey research are discussed.

Zuckerman	American Journal of Sociology	104	5	1999-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1398-1438	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article explores the social processes that produce penalties for                     illegitimate role performance. It is proposed that such penalties are                     illuminated in markets that are significantly mediated by product critics. In                     particular, it is argued that failure to gain reviews by the critics who                     specialize in a product's intended category reflects confusion over the                     product's identity and that such illegitimacy should depress demand. The                     validity of this assertion is tested among public American firms in the stock                     market over the years 1985–94. It is shown that the stock price of an American                     firm was discounted to the extent that the firm was not covered by the                     securities analysts who specialized in its industries. This analysis holds                     implications for the study of role conformity in both market and nonmarket                     settings and adds sociological insight to the recent “behavioral” critique of                     the prevailing “efficient‐market” perspective on capital markets.

Mueller	American Journal of Sociology	119	1	2013-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 216-253	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Although research on social embeddedness and social capital confirms the value of friendship networks, little has been written about how social relations form and are structured by social institutions. Using data from the Adolescent Health and Academic Achievement study and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, the authors show that the odds of a new friendship nomination were 1.77 times greater within clusters of high school students taking courses together than between them. The estimated effect cannot be attributed to exposure to peers in similar grade levels, indirect friendship links, or pair-level course overlap, and the finding is robust to alternative model specifications. The authors also show how tendencies associated with status hierarchy inhering in triadic friendship nominations are neutralized within the clusters. These results have implications for the production and distribution of social capital within social systems such as schools, giving the clusters social salience as “local positions.”

Focusing empirically on the emergence of Bolshevism, it provides biographical analysis of the Russian Revolution’s elite, finding that two‐thirds were ethnic minorities from across the Russian Empire. After exploring class and ethnicity as intersectional experiences of varying significance to the Bolsheviks' revolutionary politics, this article suggests that socialism’s class universalism found affinity with those seeking secularism in response to religious tensions, a universalist politics where ethnic violence and sectarianism were exclusionary, and an ethnically neutral and tolerant “imperial” imaginary where Russification and geopolitics were particularly threatening or imperial cultural frameworks predominated. The claim is made that socialism’s class universalism was as much a product of ethnic particularism as it was constituted by it.

State‐level event history analyses of fire insurance rate regulation from 1906 to 1930 are used. Contrary to capture theory, regulation was not driven simply by firms’ interests in market control. Instead, consistent with interest group analyses, regulation was more likely when anticompany forces—farmers and small businesses—could challenge big business politically. Further, as neoinstitutional research suggests, regulation was more likely when industry governance evoked legitimacy crises, when courts and professions endorsed regulation and its underlying models, and when states developed system‐wide administrative capacities. Institutional conditions also mediated the effects of markets and politics on regulation. Using these findings, we develop a theory of how political and institutional conditions shape industries’ governance options.

Robinson	American Journal of Sociology	110	1	2004-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1-43	The University of Chicago Press	fla		In this study, time diary data are used to assess trends in mothers’ and fathers’ child care time from the mid‐1960s to the late 1990s. Contrary to conventional wisdom, the results indicate that both mothers and fathers report spending greater amounts of time in child care activities in the late 1990s than in the “family‐oriented” 1960s. For mothers, there was a 1965–75 decline in routine child care time and then a 1975–98 rebound along with a steady increase in time doing more developmental activities. For 1998 fathers report increased participation in routine child care as well as in more “fun” activities. The ratio of married mothers’ to married fathers’ time in child care declined in all primary child care activities. These results suggest that parents have undergone a behavioral change that has more than countered family change that might otherwise have reduced time with children.

Castilla	American Journal of Sociology	113	6	2008-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1479-1526	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This study helps to fill a significant gap in the literature on organizations and inequality by investigating the central role of merit‐based reward systems in shaping gender and racial disparities in wages and promotions. The author develops and tests a set of propositions isolating processes of performance‐reward bias, whereby women and minorities receive less compensation than white men with equal scores on performance evaluations. Using personnel data from a large service organization, the author empirically establishes the existence of this bias and shows that gender, race, and nationality differences continue to affect salary growth after performance ratings are taken into account, ceteris paribus. This finding demonstrates a critical challenge faced by the many contemporary employers who adopt merit‐based practices and policies. Although these policies are often adopted in the hope of motivating employees and ensuring meritocracy, policies with limited transparency and accountability can actually increase ascriptive bias and reduce equity in the workplace.

Postnationalism, Multiculturalism, and the Collective Claims Making of Migrants and Ethnic Minorities in Britain and Germany	Ruud Koopmans, Paul Statham	American Journal of Sociology	105	3	1999-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 652-696	The University of Chicago Press	fla		As important aspects of purported tendencies toward globalization and pluralization, recent immigration waves and the resulting presence of culturally different ethnic minorities are often seen as fundamentally challenging liberal nation‐states and traditional models of citizenship. According to this perspective, migrants and ethnic minorities contribute through their claims making both to the external erosion of sovereignty (the postnational challenge), and to the internal cultural differentiation of liberal nation‐states (the multicultural challenge). In contrast, alternative theoretical approaches have emphasized the continuing relevance of the nation‐state in the processes of inclusion and exclusion of minorities. From these three perspectives on citizenship (postnational, multicultural, and national) a set of hypotheses is derived and tested with data on the collective claims making of migrants and ethnic minorities in two European countries, Britain and Germany, for the period 1990–95. The data show very little support for the postnational approach, mixed results regarding the multicultural model, and strong support for the continuing relevance of national models of citizenship. Counter to claims that national modes of migrant incorporation have become insignificant, the evidence shows that migrant claims making is still forged in the image of a particular nation‐state.

Axinn, Arland Thornton	American Journal of Sociology	104	5	1999-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1494-1524	The University of Chicago Press	fla		In this article, we introduce the concept of family integration to describe the                     way in which family social organization affects individuals. We hypothesize that                     when parents are integrated into the family, it benefits their children's                     development of self. Using panel data, we test three mechanisms of parental                     family integration‐‐activities within the home, family                     social networks, and family support networks. The results show that parental                     family integration early in a child's life has positive effects on the child's                     self‐esteem in early adulthood, 23 years later. These findings                     provide important new insights into both the social processes affecting                     self‐esteem and the long‐term consequences of various                     dimensions of family integration.

In this article, the authors examine the role of macrofactors in a cross‐national perspective. They argue that three groups of macrolevel factors are important: the country immigrants settle in (“destination” effect), the sending nation (“origin” effect), and the combination between origin and destination (“setting” or “community” effect). The authors propose a design that simultaneously observes multiple origin groups in multiple destinations. They present substantive hypotheses about language proficiency and use them to develop a series of macrolevel indicators. The authors collected and standardized 19 existing immigrant surveys for nine Western countries. Using multilevel techniques, their analyses show that origins, destinations, and settings play a significant role in immigrants’ language proficiency.

The authors divide network movies into (1) static flip books, where node position remains constant but edges cumulate over time, and (2) dynamic movies, where nodes move as a function of changes in relations. Flip books are particularly useful in contexts where relations are sparse. For more connected networks, movies are often more appropriate. Three empirical examples demonstrate the advantages of different movie styles. A new software program for creating network movies is discussed in the appendix.

Employing documentary sources and 87 predominantly oral history interviews, the article presents a historical sociology of the clusters of evaluation practices surrounding ABSs (asset-backed securities, most importantly mortgage-backed securities) and CDOs (collateralized debt obligations). Despite the close structural similarity between ABSs and CDOs, these practices came to differ substantially and became the province (e.g., in the rating agencies) of organizationally separate groups. In consequence, when ABS CDOs (CDOs in which the underlying assets are ABSs) emerged, they were evaluated in two separate stages. This created a fatally attractive arbitrage opportunity, large-scale exploitation of which sidelined previously important gatekeepers (risk-sensitive investors in the lower tranches of mortgage-backed securities) and eventually magnified and concentrated the banking system’s calamitous mortgage-related losses.

Drawing on employment history data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation and the German Socio‐Economic Panel, the analysis establishes positive effects of unemployment benefits on workers’ post‐unemployment jobs: workers’ risks of incurring severe earnings losses, of experiencing occupational mobility, and of entering unstable job arrangements are considerably reduced in both the United States and West Germany. As workers face constrained choices in labor markets, however, this institutional protection of workers’ economic status comes at the economic cost of prolonged unemployment. Simulation analyses suggest that higher benefit coverage alone might account for up to 20% of the smaller cumulative disadvantages associated with unemployment for German workers.

Data from one city reveal the interaction of political process, news value, and news routine factors in news coverage of protest versus other message events. Protests about legislative issues received the most coverage. Controlling for issue type, protest forms were covered less when the legislature was in session, while other forms (largely ceremonies and speeches) were covered more. Yearly variations in coverage rates of nonlegislative protests distorted the apparent shape of the protest cycle. Other predictive factors include size, police involvement, conflict, counterdemonstrators, amplified sound, Monday event, religious sponsorship (negative), and annual or holiday event.

This is especially true for initial courtship encounters when pairs report a sense of interpersonal chemistry. The authors explore the process of romantic bonding by applying interaction ritual theory, extended and integrated with methods from computational linguistics, to the study of courtship encounters and, specifically, heterosexual speed dating. The authors find that the assortment of interpersonal moves associated with a sense of connection characterizes a conventionalized form of initial courtship activity. The game is successfully played when females are the point of focus and engaged in the conversation and males demonstrate alignment with and understanding of the female. In short, initial heterosexual courtship encounters are associated with a sense of bonding when they reflect a reciprocal asymmetrical performance in which differentiated roles are mutually coordinated.

The authors examine two cases: the first, to explore the mechanism's implications and, the second, to demonstrate its utility in analyzing empirical data. In the first, the diffusion of Internet use, network effects increase adoption's benefits to associates of prior adopters. An agent-based model demonstrates positive, monotonic relationships, given externalities, between homophily bias and intergroup inequality in equilibrium adoption rates. In the second, rural-urban migration in Thailand, network effects reduce risk to persons whose networks include prior migrants. Analysis of longitudinal individual-level migration data indicates that network homophily interacts with network externalities to induce divergence of migration rates among otherwise similar villages.

Wong	American Journal of Sociology	104	2	1998-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 372-403	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article investigates demographic and macroeconomic correlates of racially motivated antiminority crime in New York City (1987‐95). Event count models indicate that crimes directed against Asians, Latinos, and blacks are most frequent in predominantly white areas, particularly those that had experienced an in‐migration of minori‐ties. No relationship is found between rates of racially motivated crime and macroeconomic conditions, such as the rate of unemploy‐ment among non‐Hispanic whites; nor does there appear to be an interaction between economic conditions and in‐migration of minor‐ities. These findings seem to parallel ethnographic accounts of "de‐fended" white urban neighborhoods. The article concludes by dis‐cussing the empirical implications of this theoretical perspective as applied to prejudice‐based crime in other contexts.

Ranjay Gulati, Martin Gargiulo	American Journal of Sociology	104	5	1999-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1439-1493	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Organizations enter alliances with each other to access critical                     re‐sources, but they rely on information from the network of prior                     alli‐ances to determine with whom to cooperate. These new alliances                     modify the existing network, prompting an endogenous dynamic be‐tween                     organizational action and network structure that drives the emergence of                     interorganizational networks. Testing these ideas on alliances formed in three                     industries over nine years, this research shows that the probability of a new                     alliance between specific organi‐zations increases with their                     interdependence and also with their prior mutual alliances, common third                     parties, and joint centrality in the alliance network. The differentiation of                     the emerging network structure, however, mitigates the effect of interdependence                     and en‐hances the effect of joint centrality on new alliance                     formation.

The article reviews the debate and its dilemmas in theology, philosophy, revolutionary theorizing, and social science. The epistemological issues have been reopened and redefined by complexity studies in the natural sciences and cultural studies in the humanities, both of which involve a turn toward some central premises of social science. It is argued that social science will be epistemologically central to all knowledge and that utopistics will be a central responsibility of social scientists. It is also argued that science is at its very beginnings, and that the future will be built on going beyond the antinomy determinism/free will.

This article develops the idea of "identity deployment" as a form of strategic collective action. Thus one can ask under what political conditions are identities that celebrate or suppress differences deployed strategically. A comparison of strategies used in four lesbian and gay rights campaigns shows that interactions between social movement organizations, state actors, and the opposition determine the types of identities deployed. The author suggests the model's application to the Civil Rights and feminist movements.   [The organizers of the 1993 lesbian and gay march on Washington] face a dilemma: how to put forward a set of unsettling demands for unconventional people in ways that will not make enemies of potential allies. They do so by playing down their differences before the media and the country while celebrating it in private. (Tarrow 1994, p. 10)

Using data from a random sample of firms in Shanghai, the author shows that there are two situations that cause this uncertainty: economic instability, where weak firms struggle to survive in the rapidly changing market system, and administrative instability, where large firms that were the most protected are now being forced to handle the responsibilities that were previously handled by the state. The result is that both types of firm seek stability by spreading out risk through investment in low‐risk, fast‐return markets, revealing much about the economic reforms.   The overall strategy of a firm reflects, at any given point in time, important organizational facts…. Any decision to fundamentally alter the deployment of internal resources represents a major structural change. These kinds of changes do not occur often; when they do, they provide us with an opportunity to examine the conditions under which actors can alter their social structures. (Neil Fligstein)

Lawler	American Journal of Sociology	107	2	2001-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 321-352	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article develops a theory that explains how and when emotions, produced by social exchange, generate stronger or weaker ties to relations, groups, or networks. It is argued that social exchange produces positive or negative global feelings, which are internally rewarding or punishing. The theory indicates that social units (relations, groups, networks) are perceived as a source of these feelings, contingent on the degree of jointness in the exchange task. The jointness of the task is greatest if (1) actors find it difficult to distinguish their individual effects on or contributions to solving the exchange task (nonseparability) and (2) actors perceive a shared responsibility for success or failure at the exchange task. The theory explicates the effects of different exchange structures on these conditions and, in turn, on cohesion and solidarity. Implications are developed for network‐to‐group transformations.

In this model, agents must decide whether to comply with and enforce a norm that is supported by a few fanatics and opposed by the vast majority. They find that cascades of self‐reinforcing support for a highly unpopular norm cannot occur in a fully connected social network. However, if agents’ horizons are limited to immediate neighbors, highly unpopular norms can emerge locally and then spread. One might expect these cascades to be more likely as the number of “true believers” increases, and bridge ties are created between otherwise distant actors. Surprisingly, the authors observed quite the opposite effects.

This article argues that the standard measure of military efforts—defense spending—inadequately captures the social and political impact of military preparedness. It instead suggests that military personnel policies impact social welfare efforts to the degree that they alter citizens' relationships to labor markets, directly provide social welfare benefits to military personnel, or create discursive obstacles to other groups seeking benefits. The results indicate that net of military spending, nations with relatively large armed forces make smaller social welfare efforts, while nations with conscription tend to spend more generously.

Building on recent research showing strong continuity in neighborhood environments across generations of family members, the authors argue for a revised perspective on “neighborhood effects” that considers the ways in which the neighborhood environment in one generation may have a lingering impact on the next generation. To analyze multigenerational effects, the authors use newly developed methods designed to estimate unbiased treatment effects when treatments and confounders vary over time. The results confirm a powerful link between neighborhoods and cognitive ability that extends across generations. A family's exposure to neighborhood poverty across two consecutive generations reduces child cognitive ability by more than half a standard deviation. A formal sensitivity analysis suggests that results are robust to unobserved selection bias.

Key empirical findings include positive effects of ethnic heterogeneity, religious heterogeneity, and income inequality on both the crime rate and the number of activist organizations in counties. Educational inequality diminishes the positive effect of income inequality on activism and has a strong negative effect on the crime rate. Many structural conditions associated with high numbers of activist organizations and a high crime rate decrease voter turnout rates.

This is surprising, given that world polity theory implies that the world polity should be an increasingly dense, even, flat field of association. This article describes the social structure of the world polity, using network analysis of the complete population of intergovernmental organizations as it has evolved since 1820. Analysis of the world polity's structure reveals growing fragmentation, driven by exclusive rather than universalist intergovernmental organizations. The world polity has thus grown less cohesive, more fragmented, more heterogeneous, and less “small worldly” in its structure. This structure reflects a recent rise in the regionalization of the world polity.

The use of hierarchical models allows the authors to simultaneously estimate the effects of race, within‐school residential segregation, and school diversity on friendship choice using the Add Health data. The authors use these results to predict the decline in friendship segregation that would occur if across‐ and within‐school residential segregation were eliminated in U.S. metropolitan areas. The results suggest that about a third of the level of racial friendship segregation in schools is attributable to residential segregation. Most of this effect is the result of residential segregation across schools rather than within them.

The analysis shows that analogy was the instigator of it all, enabled by the social mechanisms of professional legitimacy, conversation, technologies, time, networks, and social support. It demonstrates the work sociologists do when theory travels from professional sociology to nonacademic audiences and what happens to the theory and the sociologist in the process. It reveals the tensions when professional sociology, critical sociology, public sociology, and policy sociology are joined. A study of sociology in the field, it shows how sociologists negotiate the meaning of their work in a nonacademic situation. Thus, this account contributes to research and theory on social boundaries, the diffusion of ideas, the sociology of scientific knowledge, and current debates about public sociology and the role of the sociologist, adding to the sociology of our own work.

Einwohner	American Journal of Sociology	109	3	2003-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 650-675	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Macrolevel theories of social movement emergence posit that political opportunity “opens the door” for collective action. This article uses the case of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising to show that collective action need not always require opportunity. Warsaw Jews’ armed resistance was a response not to opportunity but to a lack thereof. Equally important was a strong sense of honor among the ghetto fighters: the hopelessness of their situation helped construct a motivational frame that equated resistance with honor and made collective resistance possible. This case therefore illustrates how framing processes can mediate structural conditions to produce collective action in the absence of opportunity. It also points to the need for additional research on protest and resistance in nondemocratic settings.

Unfortunately, research on each of these two forms tends to be isolated from the other, and research on the relationships between them is limited. In this article, the relationship between the mental health and criminal justice systems is examined. The relationship is modeled in terms of the casual processes that underlie it: processes that are common to both systems, and processes that underlie the effect of one system on another. Using a panel of cities, the article reveals strong cross‐system effects and that racial composition strongly influences jail capacity. Through this effect, both jail and hospital admissions are influenced.

The authors analyze the political strength and organization of the groups that supported and opposed state anti‐chain‐store laws. The enactment of these laws depended on intrastate political activity and the interstate diffusion of anti‐chain‐store legislation. The repeal process relied on suprastate activity, as nationally organized pro‐chain‐store forces shifted the arena of contention to the Supreme Court and forged national alliances with labor unions and agricultural cooperatives. In both enactment and repeal, the political resources and strategies of organziational forms interacted with existing institutions to determine the trajectory of institutional change.

Albiston, Virginia Mellema	American Journal of Sociology	117	3	2011-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 888-954	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article offers a theoretical and empirical analysis of legal endogeneity—a powerful process through which institutionalized organizational structures influence judicial conceptions of compliance with antidiscrimination law. It finds that organizational structures (e.g., grievance and evaluation procedures, antiharassment policies) become symbolic indicators of rational governance and compliance with antidiscrimination laws, first within organizations, but eventually in the judicial realm as well. Lawyers and judges tend to infer nondiscrimination from the mere presence of those structures. Judges increasingly defer to organizational structures in their opinions, ultimately inferring nondiscrimination from their presence. Legal endogeneity theory is tested by analyzing a random sample of 1,024 federal employment discrimination opinions (1965–99) and is found to have increased over time. Judicial deference is most likely when plaintiffs lack clout and when the legal theories require judges to rule on unobservable organizational attributes. The authors argue that legal endogeneity weakens the impact of law when organizational structures are viewed as indicators of legal compliance even in the face of discriminatory actions.

Specifically, it investigates whether ethnographic articles make causal arguments and how these arguments are made. The authors draw on a content analysis of 48 ethnographic articles sampled from four groups of sociological journals: contemporary generalist journals, contemporary specialist journals, mid-20th-century generalist journals—all in the United States—and contemporary generalist journals in Mexico. They find that ethnographies in U.S. contemporary generalist journals are most likely to advance strong and central causal claims and to use logical and rhetorical devices comparable to those used in quantitative articles. They also find that most Mexican ethnographic articles undertake a different kind of project, which they call “shedding light” on social phenomena. In addition to offering one methodological and one substantive suggestion to account for these findings, the authors highlight their implications for the sociology of social science.

Sharing an understanding does not necessarily imply having the same opinions but rather agreeing on the structures of relevance and opposition that make symbols and actions meaningful. Because meaning is contextual, different people might interpret the same reality in different ways. Yet standard quantitative sociological methods are not designed to take such heterogeneity into account. In this article, I introduce a new method—relational class analysis—that uses attitudinal data to identify groups of individuals that share distinctive ways of understanding the same domain of social activity. To demonstrate its utility I use it to reexamine the cultural omnivore thesis. I find that Americans' understandings of the social symbolism of musical taste are shaped by three competing logics of cultural distinction, in a manner that complicates contemporary sociological accounts of artistic taste.

This article explores the decoupling of an actor’s status from the actor’s underlying quality and examines the factors that influence the magnitude of decoupling. The authors specifically consider the role of quality uncertainty, diffuse status characteristics, and the self‐fulfilling prophecy. To analyze the impact of each mechanism on decoupling, they simulate the evolution of thousands of small groups using a dyadic model of status allocation. The authors discuss the results of these simulations and conclude with the implications for future research and the practical management of groups.

Complex explanations are justified by their explanatory power and theoretical appeal. Simple explanations are justified by their falsifiability and their capacity to sustain strong conclusions. I weigh the merits of simple and complex explanations, applying some basic ideas from Bayesian statistics. The Bayesian analysis provides support for a compromise position that is rigorously grounded in the fundamental rules of probability. These ideas are illustrated in an analysis of labor union growth in Sweden.

The few available tests of this claim rely on stylized measures of social class that either group detailed occupations into a small number of “big classes” or reduce them to scores on vertical scales of prestige, socioeconomic status, or cultural or economic capital. We show that these conventional approaches understate the total effects of the site of production by failing to capitalize on the institutionalized social categories that develop at the detailed occupational level.

Using data from the Current Population Survey (1973–2007), the authors show that African-Americans join unions for protection against discriminatory treatment in nonunion sectors. A model-predicted wage series also shows that, among women, black-white weekly wage gaps would be between 13% and 30% lower if union representation remained at high levels. The effect of deunionization on racial wage inequality for men is less substantial, but without deunionization, weekly wages for black men would be an estimated $49 higher. The results recast organized labor as an institution vital for its economic inclusion of African-American men and women. This study points to the need to move beyond class-based analyses of union decline to an understanding of the gendered role unions once played in mitigating racial inequality.

Raudenbush	American Journal of Sociology	105	3	1999-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 603-651	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article assesses the sources and consequences of public disorder. Based on the videotaping and systematic rating of more than 23,000 street segments in Chicago, highly reliable scales of social and physical disorder for 196 neighborhoods are constructed. Census data, police records, and an independent survey of more than 3,500 residents are then integrated to test a theory of collective efficacy and structural constraints. Defined as cohesion among residents combined with shared expectations for the social control of public space, collective efficacy explains lower rates of crime and observed disorder after controlling neighborhood structural characteristics. Collective efficacy is also linked to lower rates of violent crime after accounting for disorder and the reciprocal effects of violence. Contrary to the "broken windows" theory, however, the relationship between public disorder and crime is spurious except perhaps for robbery.

Drawing upon cultural models of the state, and articulating institutionalist conceptions of political opportunities and resources, the analysis demonstrates that this framework can be applied to challenges addressing the state as well as nonstate fields. The rational-legal diminishment of tribal rights, bureaucratic paternalism, commonsense views of tribes as racial/ethnic minorities, and the binary construction of American and Indian as oppositional identities diminished the appeal of “contentious” political action. Instead, to establish tribes’ status as sovereign nations, tribal leaders aggressively enacted infrastructural power, transposed favorable legal rulings across social fields to legitimize sovereignty discourses, and promoted a pragmatic coexistence with state and local governments. Identifying the United States as a settler colonial society, the study suggests that a decolonizing framework is more apt than racial/ethnicity approaches in conceptualizing the struggle of American Indians.

Gerber, Michael Hout	American Journal of Sociology	104	1	1998-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1-50	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Sixteen predictions from market transition theory are assessed using survey data on employment, earnings, and income in Russia, during the first five years of market reform. Although the private sector has grown, self‐employment is still rare. Incomes are down, and unemployment is up. A distended income distribution reflects unprecedented income inequality. Distinctive features of late Soviet‐era stratification persist: low returns to education, a gender gap in earnings, and low earnings among professionals. The Russian market transition offers more opportunity in trade, consumer services, and speculation and less in manufacturing than do other emerging makets. This corresponds to “merchat capitalism” and contradicts the predictions of market transition theory.   Everything the Communists told us about communism was a lie. Everything they told us about capitalism turns out to be true. (Popular Russian joke, circa 1996)

The movement presents an empirical puzzle: it simultaneously pursued racial openness and racial closure, and it justified both in the name of class interest. The article examines movement‐level narratives of race and class to show how underlying conceptions of class become implicated in the construction of interests regarding race. Communications drawn from the movement's official journal provide comprehensive data for identifying and interpreting the movement narratives of race and class. There were three separate Knights of Labor narratives. Although each connected race and class in a different way, all were driven by the movement's understanding of class and to “civic virtue” as a particularly important resource.

This article argues that the reverse-J curve is itself the result of two distinct kinds of effects of workers' power on capitalists' interests: one, a negative effect, in which workers' power undermines the capacity of capitalists to unilaterally make various kinds of decisions, and the second, a positive effect, in which workers' power helps capitalists solve the various kinds of collective action problems they face.

Using data from 22 industrialized countries, the authors examine the consequences of state interventions for both women’s employment patterns and gender inequality in occupational attainment. The findings reveal a twofold effect: developed welfare states facilitate women’s access into the labor force but not into powerful and desirable positions. Specifically, nations characterized by progressive and developed welfare policies and by a large public service sector tend to have high levels of female labor force participation, along with a high concentration of women in female‐typed occupations and low female representation in managerial occupations. The findings provide insights into the social mechanisms underlying the relations between welfare states’ benefits to working mothers and women’s participation and achievements in the labor market.

Using a sample of all letters received by a metropolitan newspaper during a three‐month period (N = 1,113), the authors demonstrate that the tone and argumentative styles of letters differ with the scope of the issues the letters address. Local issues evoke more reasoned, conciliatory tones, while issues beyond the local context evoke more emotional, confrontational tones, even after controlling for individual writers' characteristics and anger as a motivation to write.

This article argues that governance failure must be conceptualized at the market rather than the firm level because excessive pay increases for even relatively few CEOs a year spread to other firms through the cognitively and rhetorically constructed compensation networks of “peer groups,” which are used in the benchmarking process to negotiate the compensation of CEOs. Counterfactual simulation based on Standard and Poor’s ExecuComp data demonstrates that the effects of CEO “leapfrogging” potentially explain a considerable fraction of the overall upward movement of executive compensation since the early 1990s.

Merging insights from social movement theory, the sociology of law, and law and society scholarship, the author argues that law is a type of “master frame,” and that mobilizing law’s “constitutive” symbols and categories is a central, yet routinely overlooked, way in which challengers frame their grievances, identity, and objectives. This study systematically explores legal framing processes through historical‐narrative analysis of the women’s movement and the debate over protective labor laws in the 1960s. Historical evidence suggests that reciprocal transformations in the women’s movement and equal employment law were largely attributable to a symbolic framing contest between competing cultural representations of gender (“protective” vs. “equal” treatment) and that this contest was waged in explicitly legal terms.

A cross‐sectional, time‐series, negative binomial model for event counts is used to analyze the ebb and flow of Zapatista protests across the 111 municipios (municipalities) of Chiapas during this 10‐year period. The results show that while all types of demands appear to have been significant triggers of protest activity, Zapatistas concentrated their protest events in larger and more closed localities that had a history of protest activity, stable elite alignments, and a larger military presence. Openings in the political system at the local and national levels lessened protest activity in the more democratic scenarios. These results suggest that the curvilinear relationship between the structure of political opportunities and protest mobilization posited to explain social movements in well‐developed Western democracies does not explain the development of the protest cycle of a new social movement in an emerging electoral democracy.

Nurnberger, Jr., Victor Hesselbrock	American Journal of Sociology	114	s1	2008-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. S171-S201	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article describes both sociological and genetic theories of illness causation and derives propositions expected under each and under a transdisciplinary theoretical frame. The authors draw propositions from three theories—fundamental causes, social stress processes, and social safety net theories—and tailor hypotheses to the case of alcohol dependence. Analyses of a later wave of the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism reveal a complex interplay of the GABRA2 gene with social structural factors to produce cases meeting DSM/ICD diagnoses. Only modest evidence suggests that genetic influence works through social conditions and experiences. Further, women are largely unaffected in their risk for alcohol dependence by allele status at this candidate gene; family support attenuates genetic influence; and childhood deprivation exacerbates genetic predispositions. These findings highlight the essential intradisciplinary tension in the role of proximal and distal influences in social processes and point to the promise of focusing directly on dynamic, networked sequences that produce different pathways to health and illness.

However, region‐wide segregation is maintained at high levels by whites' avoidance of all‐minority areas and by their continued exodus (albeit at reduced levels) from mixed settings. Globalization of neighborhoods adds a positive new element of diversity that alters but does not erase the traditional dynamic of minority invasion succession.

A dual examination of the changing character of rural revolt in France between 1788 and 1793, on the one hand, and the collapse of the Old Regime and subsequent legislation on rural affairs, on the other, shows that both elite action and insurrectionary mobilization were shaping each other. The revolutionary assault on "feudalism" was forged in the course of this short-term coevolution. Sociologists who study social movements sometimes need to devote considerable research to uncovering the detailed histories of elite actions.

Forman	American Journal of Sociology	115	2	2009-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 527-559	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Persistent racial residential segregation is often seen as the result of preferences: whites prefer to live with whites while blacks wish to live near many other blacks. Are these neighborhood preferences color‐blind or race conscious? Does neighborhood racial composition have a net influence upon preferences, or is race a proxy for social class? This article tests the racial proxy hypothesis using an innovative experiment that isolates the net effects of race and social class, followed by an analysis of the social psychological factors associated with residential preferences. The authors find that net of social class, the race of a neighborhood’s residents significantly influenced how it was rated. Whites said the all‐white neighborhoods were most desirable. The independent effect of racial composition was smaller among blacks, who identified the racially mixed neighborhood as most desirable. Further, whites who held negative stereotypes about African‐Americans and the neighborhoods where they live were significantly influenced by neighborhood racial composition. None of the proposed social psychological factors conditioned African‐Americans' sensitivity to neighborhood racial composition.

Because there are differences in the way power is constituted at the transnational and national levels, theories of national political opportunity structures cannot be directly mapped onto the transnational level. The author describes three primary dimensions of political opportunity structure at the transnational level that explain how power is established: (1) the constitution of transnational actors and interests, (2) the definition and recognition of transnational rights, and (3) adjudication at the transnational level. The case of NAFTA suggests that while the emergence of national social movements requires nation‐states, global governance institutions can play a pivotal role in the development of transnational social movements.

Gibson	American Journal of Sociology	110	6	2005-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1561-1597	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Conversational encounters are permeable to network effects but not entirely so, for conversation is internally structured by sequential constraints and dependencies that limit the latitude people have to act on their relational commitments. The author analyzes the effects of hierarchical (superior‐subordinate) and horizontal (friendship and co‐working) networks on “participation shifts”—transitions in the identities of speakers and targets (addressees) that occur from one speaking turn to the next—in meetings of 10 groups of managers. The results point to a range of relational obligations and entitlements, such as the obligation subordinates have to bolster superiors’ control of the floor, and the way in which friendship and co‐working ties get expressed through remarks made to third parties. The article is perhaps the first to link statistically network‐analytic and conversation‐analytic levels of analysis.

The term “social structure” conveys two quite different meanings. One meaning is relational, involving networks of ties between individuals or groups of individuals. A second meaning refers to the contexts containing these individuals. Studies of neighborhood and community effects depend on variability in both types of social structure. Using data from multiple villages in Nang Rong, Thailand, this article documents substantial variability in network structure and shows that network structure covaries with context in meaningful ways, suggesting reciprocal effects of changes in both. Finally, it considers implications of variability in network structure, showing that social cohesion affects the likelihood of finding and interviewing former village residents.

On the eve of the Depression, cities with more blacks or Mexicans spent the least on social assistance and relied more heavily on private money to fund their programs. Cities with more European immigrants spent the most on relief and relied more heavily on public funding. Distinct political systems, labor market relations, and racial ideologies about each group’s proclivity to use relief best explain relief spending differences across cities.

Weeden	American Journal of Sociology	108	1	2002-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 55-101	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article elaborates and evaluates the neo‐Weberian notion of social closure to investigate positional inequality in the United States. It argues that social and legal barriers around occupations raise the rewards of their members by restricting the labor supply, enhancing diffuse demand, channeling demand, or signaling a particular quality of service. Hypotheses derived from the closure perspective are evaluated using new data that map five institutionalized closure devices—licensing, educational credentialing, voluntary certification, association representation, and unionization—onto 488 occupations. Results from multilevel models demonstrate that closure practices, particularly those that generate tangible restrictions on the labor supply, shape the contemporary structure of occupational earnings. Returns to these strategies vary across occupations but are not tightly linked to the complexity of the occupation's knowledge base. If suitably elaborated, closure theory thus offers a promising complement to individualistic explanations of earnings inequality.

Jansen	American Journal of Sociology	112	4	2007-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 953-1007	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The Zapatistas and Sandinistas both invoked historical figures in their rhetoric, but they did so in very different ways. This variation is explained by a model of path‐dependent memory work that is sensitive to how previous memory struggles enable and constrain subsequent uses of historical figures. Specifically, previous struggles produce distinct reputational trajectories that condition the potential utility of different modes of memory work. The cases illustrate two reputational trajectories, which are situated within a broader field of mnemonic possibilities. This article offers a provisional baseline for comparing contested memory projects and supplies a framework for analyzing the opportunities and constraints by which reputational trajectories condition memory work. It builds on a recent processual emphasis in the collective memory literature and suggests that the contentious politics literature needs to historicize its conception of culture and take seriously the operation of constraints on symbolic work.

McLean	American Journal of Sociology	104	1	1998-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 51-91	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Actors invoke and manupulate diverse frames of meaning by assembling cues, taken from linguistic forms laid down in the cultural background, to build their relations with others. This article examines the use of these frames in Renaissance patronage‐seeking letters, both quantitatively (through multidimensional scaling) and qualitatively (using discourse analytical concepts), to present an interactionist approach to the presentation of self and, in turn, to political culture. Writing strategies are only modestly, as actors write from achieved network positions and constantly aim to improve their position, maximize leverage, and build careers through letter writing.   I shall tell you, therefore, first, of what means I made use in order to become an intimate and follower of Gian Galeozzo, the duke of Milan; then I shall tell you how I went about winning the good will of Ladislas, king of Naples; finally I shall recount to you what sort of conduct enabled me to preserve the favor and good will of Pope Giovanni. I think, too, you will be pleased to learn of my various and different devices, my devious and seldom‐used means, which have rarely been described. Thesse are most useful ways to deal with men in civic life; therefore listen well to me. (Alberti 1969, p. 252)   I certainly agree, Lionardo, that the things Piero said all seemed to be wise and sound and full of prudense. His subtlety and considerable artistry were also clear to me…. But it seems to me that I want some other sort of thread and texture in talk on this subject…. You know the truth–how can anyone dream that mere simplicity and goodness will get him friends, or even acquaintancs not actually harmful and annoying?…. The world is amply supplied with fraudulent, false, perfidious, bold, audacious, and rapacious men. Everything in the world is profoundly unsure…. The deal with human wickedness in all its boldness, daring, and greed one must beable to remain constant, temperate, and full of inner strength. These are the qualities I would like to see actually practiced by a man whose friendship I hoped to gain and enjoy…. So there it is; I want to be instructed in this sense concerning friendship, how to obtain it, increase it, diminish it, recover it, and make it permanent. (1969, pp. 264–67)

Massey	American Journal of Sociology	114	1	2008-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 107-143	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article revisits the Moving to Opportunity housing mobility experiment, which heretofore has not provided strong evidence to support the hypothesis of neighborhood effects on economic self‐sufficiency among adults. The authors undertake a conceptual and empirical analysis of the study’s design and implementation to gain a better understanding of the selection processes that occur within the study. The article shows that the study is potentially affected by selectivity at several junctures: in determining who complied with the program’s requirements, who entered integrated versus segregated neighborhoods, and who left neighborhoods after initial relocation. Furthermore, previous researchers have not found an experimental treatment effect on adult economic self‐sufficiency, relative to controls. The authors propose an alternative approach that involves measuring the cumulative amount of time spent in different neighborhood environments. With this method, they find evidence that neighborhood is associated with outcomes such as employment, earnings, TANF receipt, and use of food stamps.

The author develops theoretical arguments to explicate the mechanisms that generate the intersubjective evaluation of the “social standings” of occupations and that give deference to occupations that can make legitimate claims on the bases of nature and reason. The proposed theoretical ideas are tested by examining patterns of occupational prestige ranking reported in 1989 GSS data. The findings are consistent with the hypotheses derived from the institutional logic that motivates this study.

Roberts	American Journal of Sociology	106	2	2000-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 387-423	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Friendships with competitors can improve the performance of organizations through the mechanisms of enhanced collaboration, mitigated competition, and better information exchange. Moreover, these benefits are best achieved when competing managers are embedded in a cohesive network of friendships (i.e., one with many friendships among competitors), since cohesion facilitates the verification of information culled from the network, eliminates the structural holes faced by customers, and facilitates the normative control of competitors. The first part of this analysis examines the performance implications of the friendship‐network structure within the Sydney hotel industry, with performance being the yield (i.e., revenue per available room) of a given hotel. This shows that friendships with competitors lead to dramatic improvements in hotel yields. Performance is further improved if a manager’s competitors are themselves friends, evidencing the benefit of cohesive friendship networks. The second part of the analysis examines the structure of friendship ties among hotel managers and shows that friendships are more likely between managers who are competitors.

This raises the question of what factors drive greater gender equality in managerial ranks. Using national equal employment opportunity (EEO‐1) data for the supermarket industry, this article proposes that high‐profile sex discrimination lawsuit filings provide the type of intense pressure that leads to increased female managerial representation. Results from fixed‐effects models demonstrate the significance of litigation in the short and long run, especially for women employed by supermarkets located in the most progressive U.S. appellate court jurisdictions. The findings also provide support for a normative effect on change based on regional variation in public orientation toward gender equality.

Contrary to accounts linking socioeconomic modernization to a “degendering” of public‐sphere institutions, sex typing of curricular fields is stronger in more economically developed contexts. The authors argue that two cultural forces combine in advanced industrial societies to create a new sort of sex segregation regime. The first is gender‐essentialist ideology, which has proven to be extremely resilient even in the most liberal‐egalitarian of contexts; the second is self‐expressive value systems, which create opportunities and incentives for the expression of “gendered selves.” Multivariate analyses suggest that structural features of postindustrial labor markets and modern educational systems support the cultivation, realization, and display of gender‐specific curricular affinities.

Quantitative comparison of German and U.S. newspapers in the period 1970–94 shows how differences in discursive opportunity affect both the strategic use of frames in the feminist repertoire about legal abortion and their long‐term success. In Germany, speakers emphasizing women's victimization and natural connection to the fetus become accepted as representing a realistic feminist position, thus mainstream, while those who would destigmatize abortion become marginalized. In the United States, the reverse is the case. Qualitative analysis of activist arguments then shows how this adaptation to opportunity by mainstream feminist speakers affects those who continue to voice “radical” concerns.

This article focuses on the consequences of incarceration for the employment outcomes of black and white job seekers. The present study adopts an experimental audit approach—in which matched pairs of individuals applied for real entry‐level jobs—to formally test the degree to which a criminal record affects subsequent employment opportunities. The findings of this study reveal an important, and much underrecognized, mechanism of stratification. A criminal record presents a major barrier to employment, with important implications for racial disparities.

Organizational sociologists argue that these policies produce a unique variety of capitalism, while world‐systems theorists argue that they lead to underdevelopment. This article advances a social structural alternative in a crucial case. Poland’s relative economic success resulted from prolonged state ownership and an interventionist state employing various industrial policy tools that facilitated efficiency‐enhancing market‐oriented restructuring before ushering in beneficial foreign direct investment. The resulting capitalist system closely resembles the typical pattern found in most late industrializers.

Drawing upon evidence from Glasgow and Bristol, the authors identify a polycentric model of civic coordination based on horizontal solidarity, in which associations form dense clusters of strong identity ties (“social bonds”) bridged by fewer instrumental ties (“transactions”). Basic relational mechanisms, consistent across localities, provide the basis for both micro‐ and macrointegration: they generate networks tight enough to embed civic associations in a distinctive environment, but open enough to connect them to a broader range of civic organizations. While contributing primarily to the understanding of political networks, the authors' findings also have implications for current debates on associational social capital and the impact of political contexts on the structure of collective action.

The authors employed a laboratory experiment to evaluate the hypothesis that status‐based discrimination plays an important role and an audit study of actual employers to assess its real‐world implications. In both studies, participants evaluated application materials for a pair of same‐gender equally qualified job candidates who differed on parental status. The laboratory experiment found that mothers were penalized on a host of measures, including perceived competence and recommended starting salary. Men were not penalized for, and sometimes benefited from, being a parent. The audit study showed that actual employers discriminate against mothers, but not against fathers.

They hypothesize that political parties, in their role as gatekeepers, mediate the relationship between country‐level factors, such as women’s participation in the labor force, and political outcomes for women. The article focuses on three outcomes for women: the percentage of female political party leaders, the percentage of female candidates in a country, and the percentage of women elected. New cross‐national measures of women’s inclusion in political parties are developed and analyzed in a cross‐national, path‐analytic model of women in politics to find that (1) women’s position in party elites translates into gains for women as candidates only under proportional representation systems, (2) women’s position in party elites increases the likelihood that female candidates will be elected only in nonproportional representation systems, and (3) parties may be overly sensitive to the perceived liability of women as candidates, when in fact, women have success as candidates across all regions of the world.

Minkoff	American Journal of Sociology	104	6	1999-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1666-1703	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article provides an integrated analysis of social movement organizational change and survival based on the activities of national women's and racial minority organizations during 1955‐‐85. Results demonstrate that core transitions in social change strategies are influenced in contradictory ways by the social movement environment. Older and more formalized movement organizations are more flexible, but the kinds of changes undertaken are not necessarily conservative. The benefits of transformation are limited, however, and organizational change increases the risk of failure with little evidence of a declining effect over time. In the long run, this shapes the organizational system in ways that potentially improve its legitimacy but may also limit the development of an infrastructure for future mobilization.

Yet their formation faces the homophily hurdle: important and intimate social ties tend to be established disproportionately between those sharing significant social attributes. In the spirit of analytical sociology, the author explores two mechanisms that could drive intra- and intergroup relations: attraction to similar versus repulsion from dissimilar others. The models differ in predictions as illustrated by data on interethnic marriages in Great Britain and the United States, on U.S. dating and cohabitation relations by religion and education, on educational diversity in marriages in 22 European countries, and on marriages of the native and foreign-born in Austria. A unified model for the two mechanisms, in which tie formation is a conceptualized as a two-stage process of encounter and consummation, is proposed, and its empirical and theoretical analysis provides deeper understanding of the homophily hurdle.

Reay	American Journal of Sociology	118	1	2012-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 45-87	The University of Chicago Press	fla		In an increasingly knowledge-based global environment, American-style economics may be an especially important form of expertise to understand. Existing studies of the discipline present something of a paradox, however, as some suggest that economic discourse is a logically unified and powerful promarket ideology, while others indicate that in practice it is quite fragmented and constrained. A series of 52 interviews with economists working in various jobs is used to reveal a possible way out of this paradox by highlighting three basic features of economic expertise: cognitive and practical framing via a “core” of relatively simple ideas and techniques, great flexibility in results due to various available “subframes,” and dependence of the selection of subframes on local institutional contexts. These underlying features potentially explain how the unified academic discourse of economics produces a variety of outcomes and maybe even plays a range of quite different social roles in different situations.

However, few studies have explored why this earnings disadvantage exists. This article investigates whether and to what extent this disadvantage can be attributed to the lower value of foreign education in the U.S. job market. By comparing earnings of four groups of workers—U.S.‐born whites, U.S.‐born Asian‐Americans, U.S.‐educated Asian immigrants, and Asian immigrants who completed education prior to immigration, we examine earnings gaps between whites and Asian‐Americans that are attributable to race, nativity, and place of education. Our results show that (1) there is no earnings difference across U.S.‐born whites, U.S.‐born Asian‐Americans, and U.S.‐educated Asian immigrants, and that (2) foreign‐educated Asian immigrants earn approximately 16% less than the other three groups of workers. We conclude that place of education plays a crucial role in the stratification of Asian‐Americans, whereas race and nativity per se are inconsequential once place of education is taken into account.

Walder	American Journal of Sociology	112	3	2006-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 710-750	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Theories about political movements typically posit models of actor choice that contain untested static assumptions about context. Short‐run changes in these contexts—induced by rapid shifts in the properties of political institutions—can alter choices and actors’ interests, rapidly transforming the political landscape. China’s Red Guard Movement of 1966–68 is a case in point. A generation of scholarship has attributed its violent factionalism to the opposed interests of different status groups. New evidence about the origins of the movement in Beijing’s universities indicates that to the contrary, factions emerged when activists in similar structural positions made opposed choices in ambiguous contexts. Activists subsequently mobilized to defend earlier choices, binding them to antagonistic factions. Rapid shifts in the contexts for political choice can alter prior connections between social position and interests, generating new motives and novel identities. Close attention to these contextual mechanisms can yield novel accounts of the nature and origins of political movements.

Greve	American Journal of Sociology	103	1	1997-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1-37	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Changes in corporate governance practices can be analyzed by linking the adaptations of individual firms to the structures of the networks in which firms' decision makers are embedded. Network structures determine the speed of adaptation and ultimate patterns of prevalence of governance practices by exposing a firm to particular role models and standards of appropriateness. The authors compare the spreads of two governance innovations adopted in response to the 1980s takeover wave: poison pills (which spread rapidly through a board‐to‐board diffusion process) and golden parachutes (which spread slowly through geographic proximity). The study closes with a discussion of networks as links between individual adaptation and collective structures.

Jeff Manza, Clem Brooks	American Journal of Sociology	103	5	1998-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1235-1266	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Social scientists and political commentators have frequently pointed to differences between men and women in voting and policy attitudes as evidence of an emerging "gender gap" in U.S. politics. Using survey data for 11 elections since 1952, this study develops a systematic analysis of the gender gap in presidential elections. The authors find evidence that women's changing rates of labor force participation explain the origins of the gender gap. Additional analyses show that attitudes toward social service spending mediate the interrelationship of women's labor force participation and vote choice. In the 1992 election, feminist consciousness also emerged as a significant factor shaping women's voting behavior.

Secularization theorists claim the former, while religious economies proponents claim the latter, and each side has used estimated pluralism‐participation correlations to support its argument. Using a formal game theoretic model, this article shows how religious market forces and regulations generate plausible pluralism‐participation correlations, whether or not the direct causal mechanisms argued by either side of the debate exist. The model generates testable hypotheses concerning the pluralism‐participation relationship at both local and national levels and yields insights into previous empirical work.

Wojnowicz	American Journal of Sociology	118	4	2013-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 980-1022	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The masculine overcompensation thesis asserts that men react to masculinity threats with extreme demonstrations of masculinity, a proposition tested here across four studies. In study 1, men and women were randomly given feedback suggesting they were either masculine or feminine. Women showed no effects when told they were masculine; however, men given feedback suggesting they were feminine expressed more support for war, homophobic attitudes, and interest in purchasing an SUV. Study 2 found that threatened men expressed greater support for, and desire to advance in, dominance hierarchies. Study 3 showed in a large-scale survey on a diverse sample that men who reported that social changes threatened the status of men also reported more homophopic and prodominance attitudes, support for war, and belief in male superiority. Finally, study 4 found that higher testosterone men showed stronger reactions to masculinity threats than those lower in testosterone. Together, these results support the masculine overcompensation thesis, show how it can shape political and cultural attitudes, and identify a hormonal factor influencing the effect.

The main findings are (1) the migration of the nonpoor away from moderately poor neighborhoods has been a key process in forming new high‐poverty neighborhoods, although in the early 1980s increasing poverty rates were also important; and (2) African‐Americans have moved into predominately white neighborhoods at a pace sufficient to increase their numbers there, but neighborhoods with increasing black populations tend to lose white population rapidly. Implications for theories of poor neighborhoods are discussed.

The magnitude of the religious cleavage remains substantial but has declined during the past nine presidential elections. The single factor behind this decline is the reduction in support for Republican candidates among denominationally liberal Protestants, whose changing voting behavior is a function of their increasingly liberal views of social issues. The political alignments of Catholics and conservative Protestants have been very stable relative to the electorate‐wide mean over this time period, and the authors find no evidence of increased political mobilization among conservative Protestants.

To address this conundrum, this article utilizes sibling data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and extends structural equation sibling models to incorporate siblings' genetic relationships in order to explore the role of families' social characteristics for adolescent weight. The article is the first to demonstrate that the association between parents' obesity and adolescent weight is both social and genetic. Furthermore, by incorporating genetic information, the shared and social origins of the correlation between inactivity and weight are better revealed.

Bailey	American Journal of Sociology	114	3	2008-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 577-614	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article analyzes race‐targeted policy in Brazil as both a political stake and a powerful instrument in an unfolding classificatory struggle over the definition of racial boundaries. The Brazilian state traditionally embraced mixed‐race classification, but is adopting racial quotas employing a black/white scheme. To explore potential consequences of that turn for beneficiary identification and boundary formation, the author analyzes attitudinal survey data on race‐targeted policy and racial classification in multiple formats, including classification in comparison to photographs. The results show that almost half of the mixed‐race sample, when constrained to dichotomous classification, opts for whiteness, a majority rejects mixed‐race individuals for quotas, and the mention of quotas for blacks in a split‐ballot experiment nearly doubles the percentage choosing that racial category. Theories of how states make race emphasize the use of official categories to legislate exclusion. In contrast, analysis of the Brazilian case illuminates how states may also make race through policies of official inclusion.

The authors use longitudinal data and a latent class model embedded in a competing-risks event history model to assess distinct predictors of wives and husbands leaving marriages. They find that when men are not employed, either spouse is more likely to leave. When wives report better-than-average marital satisfaction, their employment affects neither spouse’s exit. However, when wives report below-average marital satisfaction, their employment makes it more likely they will leave. The authors’ findings suggest that theories of divorce require “gendering” to reflect asymmetric gender change.

Lee	American Journal of Sociology	113	1	2007-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 41-96	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This study contests the universalism of public engagement models by comparing reports of informal communication in two state‐centered participation processes for regional conservation planning. Through interviews with stakeholders, the author finds that both elites and nonelites deployed informal communication to amplify and to defuse pressure for consensus. Much of the power of informal communication derived from its relation to local knowledge and place‐based networking that was irrelevant in principle to formal process activities—and this was welcomed in one community and resisted in another. These differences highlight the overlooked role of regional‐scale political cultures in light of the increasing formalization of participatory best practices. The article suggests that the study of democratic engagement can gain by exploring the contextual implementation of abstract deliberative ideals such as inclusion, publicity, and transparency.

Between 1970 and 1997, blacks and whites became increasingly similar in the rate at which they move between poor and nonpoor neighborhoods, but much of this racial convergence was driven by changes in the relative sociodemographic characteristics of white and black households and shifting ecological conditions of metropolitan areas. Furthermore, race remains a salient factor in determining the likelihood of exiting or entering poor neighborhoods, and there is little evidence of increasing class selectivity in this movement.

Using the ethnosurvey approach developed in the Mexican Migration Project, the authors conducted surveys in migrant‐sending communities in China as well as in destination communities in New York City. Hypotheses are derived from the international migration literature and the market transition debate. The results are generally consistent with hypotheses derived from cumulative causation of migration; however, geographical location creates some differences in migration patterns to the United States. In China as in Mexico, the existence of migration networks increases the propensity of migration for others in the community. In contrast to the Mexican case, among Chinese immigrants, having a previously migrated household member increases the propensity of other household members to migrate only after the debt for previous migration is paid off. In step with market transition theory, the authors also find that political power influences the migration experience from the coastal Fujian Province.

Different conceptions of institutional emergence underlie different answers to this question. Many scholars argue that firms create certification systems to solve problems in the market—a view rooted in a conception of institutions as solutions to collective action problems. The author develops a different account by viewing institutions as the outcome of political contestation and by analyzing conflict and institutional entrepreneurship among a wide array of actors. Using a comparative case study design, the analysis shows how these arguments explain the formation of social and environmental certification associations. Both theoretical approaches are needed, but strong versions of the market‐based approach overlook an important set of dynamics that the author calls the “political construction of market institutions.” The analysis shows how both problem solving in markets and political contention generate new institutional forms.

Polavieja	American Journal of Sociology	118	3	2012-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 592-634	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article offers an innovative explanation for gender differences in job specialization that connects individual choices to the social structure. Decisions about jobs are modeled as a choice over different tenure-reward slopes, which are steeper for more specialized skills. The choice of job depends on expected duration. Individuals have imperfect information about their probability of success in different jobs and form expectations partly by observing the social context. Because women face greater constraints and uncertainties than men, their choices depend more on this context. Contextual influences on job specialization are tested for European respondents nested in 234 different regions. Consonant with the theory’s predictions, women are found to have more specialized jobs in regions where (1) the preceding generation’s job specialization diverged less by gender, (2) peers arrange a more equal division of housework, and (3) peers have fewer children. None of these contextual variables have significant effects on men.

Why did some states pass such fair employment practice (FEP) laws much more slowly than other states? This article presents archival and statistical evidence that partisan control of policy‐making institutions—namely, Republican control of “veto points” in the legislative process—is associated with a substantial reduction in the likelihood that a state would pass FEP legislation, even when controlling for potentially confounding variables. This finding casts doubt on the leading account of the electoral realignment that began in the mid‐1960s and culminated in the Reagan‐Bush years. Well before the advent of affirmative action, key numbers of GOP officeholders—allied with organized business and motivated by a free‐market, antiregulatory ideology—worked successfully to block the adoption of color‐blind laws mandating formal racial equality.

Drawing on a model of racial classification and policy choice, we test four hypotheses regarding client race, local context, and sanctioning. Based on longitudinal and cross-sectional multilevel analyses of individual-level administrative data, we find that race plays a significant role in shaping sanction implementation. Its effects, however, are highly contingent on client characteristics, local political contexts, and the degree to which state governments devolve policy control to local officials.

This lower reemployment rate of displaced black workers may be due to individual differences in search behavior, but it is also consistent with contemporary accounts of hiring discrimination.

Yet, cultural mechanisms are often overlooked in quantitative studies of neighborhood effects. This paper adds a cultural dimension to neighborhood effects research by exploring the consequences of legal cynicism. Legal cynicism refers to a cultural frame in which people perceive the law as illegitimate, unresponsive, and ill equipped to ensure public safety. The authors find that legal cynicism explains why homicide persisted in certain Chicago neighborhoods during the 1990s despite declines in poverty and declines in violence citywide.

Jiménez	American Journal of Sociology	113	6	2008-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1527-1567	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The literature on assimilation and ethnic identity formation largely assumes that the durability of ethnic boundaries is a function of the assimilation measures that sociologists commonly employ. But this literature fails to account adequately for the role of immigration patterns in explaining the durability and nature of ethnic boundaries. Using 123 in‐depth interviews with later‐generation Mexican Americans, this article shows that Mexican immigrant replenishment shapes ethnic boundaries and ethnic identity formation. The sizable immigrant population sharpens intergroup boundaries through the indirect effects of nativism and by contributing to the continuing significance of race in the lives of later‐generation Mexican Americans. The presence of a large immigrant population also creates intragroup boundaries that run through the Mexican‐origin population and that are animated by expectations about ethnic authenticity. The article illustrates the importance of immigrant replenishment to processes of assimilation and ethnic identity formation.

Skrentny	American Journal of Sociology	111	6	2006-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1762-1815	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Using historical analysis of the inclusiveness of Labor Department affirmative action regulations for African‐Americans, American Indians, Asian Americans, Latinos, women, and white ethnics, this article shows that understanding variations in social movement success requires understanding policy‐elite perceptions of the meanings of social movements and the groups they represent. Variation in perceived meanings along dimensions of definition, morality, or threat helps explain the speed of group inclusion, the amount of mobilization needed, and possiblity for failure. Ethnoracial minorities benefited from perceptions of definitional and moral similarity to blacks, but elites perceived women as different definitionally and white ethnics as different definitionally and morally. Policy‐elite perceptions create obstacles for some groups, forcing them to struggle longer and harder for the same policy outcome.

Sociology actually emerged from a broad cultural dynamic in which tensions of liberalism and empire were central. Global expansion and colonization gave sociology its main conceptual framework and much of its data, key problems, and methods. After early‐20th‐century crisis, a profoundly reconstructed American discipline emerged, centered on difference and disorder within the metropole. The retrospective creation of a “classical” canon solved certain cultural dilemmas for this enterprise and generated a discipline‐defining pedagogy, at the price of narrowing sociology's intellectual scope and concealing much of its history.

Soule, Brayden G King	American Journal of Sociology	113	6	2008-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1568-1610	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Drawing hypotheses from resource mobilization and resource partitioning theories (RMT and RPT), this article examines how interorganizational competition and social movement industry (SMI) concentration affect the level of tactical and goal specialization of protest organizations associated with the peace, women’s, and environmental movements. Additionally, the article examines how specialization affects the survival of these organizations. By and large, the findings are commensurate with the expectations of RMT and RPT. Results indicate that interorganizational competition leads to more specialized tactical and goal repertoires. Concentration in the SMI also leads to specialization, but this is only true for less established organizations. Results also indicate that tactical and goal specialization decrease organizational survival, unless the industry is highly concentrated.

Sobel	American Journal of Sociology	106	4	2001-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 913-943	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Recent observers have pointed to a growing polarization within the U.S. public over politicized moral issues—the so‐called culture wars. DiMaggio, Evans, and Bryson studied trends over the past 25 years in American opinion on a number of critical social issues, finding little evidence of increased polarization; abortion is the primary exception. However, their conclusions are suspect because they treat ordinal or nominal scales as interval data. This article proposes new methods for studying polarization using ordinal data and uses these to model the National Election Study (NES) abortion item. Whereas the analysis of this item by DiMaggio et al. points to increasing polarization of abortion attitudes between 1972 and 1994, this article's analyses of these data offers little support for this conclusion and lends weight to their view that recent concerns over polarization are overstated.

Zuckerman	American Journal of Sociology	118	4	2013-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1023-1054	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Why are some diversified market identities problematic but others are not? We examine this question in the context of high-status corporate law firms, which often diversify into one low-status area of work—family law (FL)—but face a barrier (strong disapproval from existing clients) that prevents diversification into another such area—plaintiffs’ personal injury law (PIL). Drawing on a qualitative study of the Boston legal market, we argue that this barrier reflects a situation where loyalty norms have been violated, and it surfaces because service to individual plaintiffs is tantamount to betraying the interests of corporate clients. Our analysis clarifies identity-based limits to diversification, indicating that they are rooted in concerns about the firm’s commitments as well as its capabilities, and suggests a more general refinement of theory on status and conformity.

This article depicts identity movements that strive to expand individual autonomy as motors of institutional change. It proposes that the sociopolitical legitimacy of activists, extent of theorization of new roles, prior defections by peers to the new logic, and gains to prior defectors act as identity‐discrepant cues that induce actors to abandon traditional logics and role identities for new logics and role identities. A study of how the nouvelle cuisine movement in France led elite chefs to abandon classical cuisine during the period starting from 1970 and ending in 1997 provides wide‐ranging support for these arguments. Implications for research on institutional change, social movements, and social identity are outlined.

The authors developed a theoretical framework to explain how a broad array of nonfamily experiences may translate into greater participation in the choice of a spouse. Analyses show that premarital nonfamily experiences, in general, and media exposure and participation in youth clubs, in particular, have strong positive effects on individual participation in the choice of a spouse. These findings suggest new ways of thinking about the relationship between social change and the transition away from arranged marriage. Overall, changes in these nonfamily experiences can account for a substantial fraction of the historical increase of youth involvement in mate selection.

Although there is some curvilinearity at low levels of prevalence, the relationship is generally negative. Thus, all else equal, where a particular crime is frequent, any punishment applied to it is likely to be mild; conversely, where a crime is infrequent, its punishment ought to be severe. Using hierarchical regression models, the authors support this hypothesis with 1988 homicide conviction and imprisonment decisions in 32 U.S. counties.

This study proposes an analytic framework that combines “welfare regime” and gender‐specific policies to explain country differences. The findings presented here suggest that institutional arrangements mediate the costs to women's part‐time and intermittent employment. Within welfare regimes, employment continuity is highest among countries in which the state provides support for working mothers. Furthermore, this study finds that lower support for mothers' employment is associated with higher wage penalties to employment discontinuity.

Since lottery tickets are assets with negative expected return, lottery play challenges the basic assumptions of economic theory. This article approaches lottery play from a networks perspective and focuses on syndicate play. A comparison of the development of lottery markets in Germany, Austria, Spain, and Portugal from the 17th century onward shows that lottery play declined with rising incomes except in countries in which syndicate play diffused widely, namely, Spain, and to a lesser extent, Portugal. Although syndicating originated among the relatively poor as a response to an increase in lottery prices, it persisted even when individual play became affordable. This article contends that syndicating endured because of an institutionalization process by which lottery tickets have transformed from purely economic assets into symbolic carriers of interpersonal ties that convey membership and status position in relevant social networks.

The analyses are based on a longitudinal panel design and focus on four disorders: anxiety, depression, antisocial disorder, and attention deficit disorder. The article shows that each disorder has a unique relationship with SES, highlighting the need for greater consideration of antisocial disorders in the status attainment process and for further theoretical development in the sociology of mental disorders to account for disorder‐specific relations with SES.

Laumann	American Journal of Sociology	117	1	2011-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 172-208	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article combines relational perspectives on gender identity with social network structural perspectives on health to understand men's sexual functioning. The authors argue that network positions that afford independence and control over social resources are consistent with traditional masculine roles and may therefore affect men's sexual performance. For example, when a heterosexual man's female partner has more frequent contact with his confidants than he does—which the authors refer to as partner betweenness—his relational autonomy, privacy, and control are constrained. Analyses of data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) show that about a quarter of men experience partner betweennessa and that these men are 92% more likely to report erectile dysfunction. Partner betweenness is strongest among the youngest men in the sample, which may reflect changing conceptions of masculinity in later life. The authors consider several explanations for these findings and urge additional research on the links between health, gender, and network structure.

Martin	American Journal of Sociology	119	1	2013-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 131-182	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The traditional “jurisprudential model” of law views the application of legal sanctions primarily as a function of the facts of the case and the rules that govern the proceedings. Sociology of law scholars have challenged this model on theoretical grounds, arguing persuasively that law is variable and often yields patterns that parallel broader considerations of community social organization and collective sentiment. The authors' analysis yields evidence that the certainty and severity of sanctions for murder cases are heightened where social capital is more plentiful, religious fundamentalist values more prevalent, and support for punitive sanctions is greater. They also find that sentences given to murder defendants are longer in areas in which the public expresses higher levels of fear. Overall, the findings provide provocative evidence that legal outcomes in murder cases are influenced by several features of the social environments in which they are processed.

The authors find that these changes had a small, negative effect on inequality: there would have been more inequality in earnings in the early 2000s if educational assortative mating patterns had remained as they were in the 1970s. Given the educational distribution of men and women in the United States, educational assortative mating can have only a weak impact on inequality, and educational sorting among partners is a poor proxy for sorting on earnings.

In‐depth interviews with union organizers and other data are used to identify the sources of radical transformation in labor organizations by comparing local unions that have substantially altered their goals and tactics with those that have changed little. This analysis highlights three factors: the occurrence of a political crisis in the local leading to new leadership, the presence of leaders with activist experience outside the labor movement who interpret the decline of labor’s power as a mandate to change, and the influence of the international union in favor of innovation. The article concludes by drawing out the theoretical implications of the finding that bureaucratic conservatism can sometimes be overcome in mature social movements.

Phillips	American Journal of Sociology	113	3	2007-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 781-814	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Ethnic competition theory provides considerable insight into the localized contexts within which ethnic solidarities intensify and contribute to increased conflict, but gives less guidance as to how the spatial dynamics of such contexts impact the rise of sustained ethnic mobilization. Using the case of the Civil Rights–era Ku Klux Klan in North Carolina, the authors show that threat/competition dynamics were tied to distinct dimensions of spatial context and then root these spatial effects in social processes. Specifically, the authors demonstrate that mobilization was facilitated by the presence of opportunities for connections within and across counties, through which information about the klan could spread to other aggrieved individuals. These findings suggest that more attention be paid to the mesolevel contexts within which reactive political contention emerges.

This article argues that racial similarity among neighborhoods emerges primarily from their relational connections via tertiary streets rather than as a result of geographic proximity. Analyzing tertiary streets can better predict racial composition than can spatial considerations. Segregated networks of neighborly relations emerge from segregated networks of residential streets. Racial populations are organized in space with respect to who is “down the street” rather than in terms of mere physical distance.

Ellison	American Journal of Sociology	106	3	2000-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 551-578	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Research on fear of crime in the United States has concentrated on personal fear while overlooking the fear that people have for others in their lives—children, spouses, friends—whose safety they value. Sample survey data reveal that altruistic fear (fear for others) has a distinctive structure in family households and is more common and often more intense than personal fear. Many of the everyday precautions practiced by Americans and conventionally assumed to be self‐protective appear to be a consequence of altruistic fear. These and other findings underscore the need to understand fear of crime as a social rather than an individual phenomenon.

Analyzing over 4,000 events in the Chicago area from 1970 to 2000, the authors find that while civic engagement is durable overall, “sixties‐style” protest declines, and hybrid events that combine public claims making with civic forms of behavior—what they call “blended social action”—increase. Furthermore, dense social ties, group memberships, and neighborly exchange do not predict community variations in collective action. The density of nonprofit organizations matters instead, suggesting that declines in traditional social capital may not be as consequential for civic capacity as commonly thought.

Using the example of media rankings of law schools, this article argues that the methodological concept of reactivity—the idea that people change their behavior in reaction to being evaluated, observed, or measured—offers a useful lens for disclosing how these measures effect change. A framework is proposed for investigating the consequences, both intended and unintended, of public measures. The article first identifies two mechanisms, self‐fulfilling prophecy and commensuration, that induce reactivity and then distinguishes patterns of effects produced by reactivity. This approach demonstrates how these increasingly fateful public measures change expectations and permeate institutions, suggesting why it is important for scholars to investigate the impact of these measures more systematically.

Thye, Jeongkoo Yoon	American Journal of Sociology	106	3	2000-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 616-657	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This study refines and experimentally tests a theory of relational cohesion that explains how and when actors become committed to one another in the context of multiactor exchange. The theory asserts that frequent social exchange results in (1) positive emotions that solidify and strengthen the person‐to‐group bond and (2) uncertainty reduction that renders the focal group more salient in relation to others. These two mechanisms produce a sense of psychological group formation and ultimately increase observable acts of commitment. In a “productive exchange” setting, three actors negotiate a joint venture that requires the assent of all members. The exchanges featured two forms of commitment behavior: the giving of small token gifts and the decision to invest in a three‐way prisoner’s dilemma. The results suggest that positive emotion and uncertainty reduction are theoretically distinct and affect commitment behavior through different mechanisms. The article concludes by discussing the general implications for commitment and social order.

Sorenson	American Journal of Sociology	105	6	2000-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1523-1558	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Satisfactory class concepts need to identify the mechanisms that produce the consequences of class membership, be they class conflicts or differences in lifestyles. Using a broad conception of property rights, the article proposes to base class concepts on personal wealth, that is, the assets a person controls. Two main class concepts are proposed: class as life conditions, based on a person's total wealth, and class as exploitation, based on a person's control over assets that produce economic rents. The former concept corresponds to empirical and Weberian class concepts, the latter to Marxist and neo‐Marxist class concepts. The article shows that the class concept based on rent‐producing assets accounts for recent developments in capitalism.

The authors construct a measure of the demand for female labor and test its impact on labor market inequality, educational attainment, family structure, political representation, and gender role attitudes across 261 metropolitan areas. Areas with more traditional female occupational structures have less labor market and educational gender inequality. However, there is little evidence of a relationship between demand for female labor and family, politics, or gender attitudes. Macrolevel gender stratification theories may therefore have a scope that is too broad. Different gendered outcomes depend on different sets of causal influences.

Companies may act against immediate market signals during recessions because of uncertainties about strategy and the future direction of the economy. A mesolevel sociological model of how firms interpret and respond to economic conditions in uncertain times improves understanding of firms’ variable responses to recessions, which cumulatively shape macroeconomic trajectories. Examining firm-level employment during four recessions from 1950 to 1970, the author generates results from dynamic panel models to show that firms set their employment levels against profits and market share and in alignment with peers and political affiliations. Firms manage uncertainty by imitating peers but also by endeavoring to construct their environment collectively through business associations. This article’s counterintuitive economic findings and the evidence of social and political influences reinforce the importance of careful investigation into how firms respond to recessions.

Elder, Jr.	American Journal of Sociology	110	3	2004-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 761-793	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The labor needs of World War II fueled a growing demand for both military and war industry personnel. This longitudinal study investigates mobilization into these competing activities and their work life effects among men from the middle class. Hazard estimates show significant differences in wartime activities across occupations, apart from other deferment criteria. By war's end, critical employment, in contrast to military service, is positively associated with supervisory responsibility for younger men and with occupation change. This empoloyment does not predict postwar career advancement up to the 1970s. By comparison, men who were officers had a “pipeline” to advancement after the war, whereas other service men fared worse than nonveterans.

In order to do this, the author uses GIS to (1) test an important category of spatial hypotheses (spatial proximity hypotheses), (2) overcome methodological problems that arise when data sets are not spatially comparable, and (3) measure ecological context. The author introduces a set of GIS variable construction techniques that are designed to accomplish these tasks, illustrates these techniques empirically by using them to test spatial proximity hypotheses drawn from the literature on environmental inequality, and demonstrates that results obtained using these techniques are methodologically superior to and substantively different from results obtained using traditional techniques. Finally, the author demonstrates that these techniques are the product of an alternative conceptualization of physical space that allows sociologists to develop new ways to think about and measure spatial relationships, ecological context, and place‐based social inequality and that gives them the ability to reconceptualize spatially based methodological problems that have confronted them for years.

The author introduces a multilevel process theory to understand how these characteristics are generated and transformed over time. The theory assumes that ethnic boundaries are the outcome of the classificatory struggles and negotiations between actors situated in a social field. Three characteristics of a field—the institutional order, distribution of power, and political networks—determine which actors will adopt which strategy of ethnic boundary making. The author then discusses the conditions under which these negotiations will lead to a shared understanding of the location and meaning of boundaries. The nature of this consensus explains the particular characteristics of an ethnic boundary. A final section identifies endogenous and exogenous mechanisms of change.

However, emergence has also been invoked by methodological individualists; they accept the existence of emergent social properties yet claim that such properties can be reduced to explanations in terms of individuals and their relationships. Thus, contemporary sociological uses of emergence are contradictory and unstable. This article clarifies this situation by developing an account of emergence based in contemporary philosophy of mind. The philosophical account is used to evaluate contradictory sociological theories. Several unresolved issues facing theories of emergence in sociology are identified.

The path‐dependent models offered by fiscal‐military, rational choice, and geopolitical theorists are evaluated in comparison with an elite conflict model of contingent historical change. The latter model is found to be better able to explain territorial and fiscal stagnation and decline as well as imperial expansion in the cases of early modern Spain, France, the Netherlands, and Britain.

They develop a social sequence analysis to identify distinctive pathways whereby firms use network resources to buffer uncertainty, hide or restructure assets, or gain knowledge and legitimacy. During this period, networked property grew, stabilized, and involved a growing proportion of foreign capital. Cohesive networks of recombinant property were robust, and in fact integrated foreign investment. Although multinationals, through their subsidiaries, dissolved ties in joint venture arrangements, the authors find evidence that they also built durable networks. These findings suggest that developing economies do not necessarily face a forced choice between networks of global reach and those of local embeddedness.

As the formal institutions regulating industrial relations in the United States have declined, workplace struggles have expanded or reentered into other arenas of the state and civil society. In addition, the essay develops the methodological concept of a “signal juncture,” that is, moments of conflict that reveal a “collision” of underlying developmental paths. Unlike the more familiar concept of the critical juncture, a signal juncture reveals ongoing structural tensions and conflicting actors within otherwise continuous trends.

This article investigates European countries’ attribution of rights to immigrants: Have these rights become more inclusive and more similar across countries? Are they affected by EU membership, the role of the judiciary, the party in power, the size of the immigrant electorate, or pressure exerted by anti-immigrant parties? Original data on 10 European countries, 1980–2008, reveal no evidence for cross-national convergence. Rights tended to become more inclusive until 2002, but stagnated afterward. Electoral changes drive these trends: growth of the immigrant electorate led to expansion, but countermobilization by right-wing parties slowed or reversed liberalizations. These electoral mechanisms are in turn shaped by long-standing policy traditions, leading to strong path dependence and the reproduction of preexisting cross-national differences.

The Penal System as a Labor Market Institution	Bruce Western, Katherine Beckett	American Journal of Sociology	104	4	1999-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1030-60	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Comparative research contrasts the corporatist welfare states of Europe with the unregulated U.S. labor market to explain low rates of U.S. unemployment in the 1980s and 1990s. In contrast, this article argues that the U.S. state made a large and coercive intervention into the labor market through the expansion of the penal system. The impact of incarceration on unemployment has two conflicting dynamics. In the short run, U.S. incarceration lowers conventional unemployment measures by removing able‐bodied, working‐age men from labor force counts. In the long run, social survey data show that incarceration raises unemployment by reducing the job prospects of ex‐convicts. Strong U.S. employment performance in the 1980s and 1990s has thus depended in part on a high and increasing incarceration rate.

Bothner	American Journal of Sociology	108	6	2003-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1175-1210	The University of Chicago Press	fla		When is a social actor most strongly influenced by its peers? This article addresses this question by clarifying when computer firms were most strongly affected by the choices of their structurally equivalent rivals to adopt a well‐known technology: Intel’s sixth‐generation processor. The core hypothesis is that the effect of adoptions by structurally equivalent firms increases with the competitive pressure that a focal firm faces in its market position. The results show that a chosen firm is most strongly influenced by comparable others when it faces scale‐based competition and is diversified. The implications of this study are twofold: a social actor’s sensitivity to the conduct of others may depend not only on its place in a hierarchy but also on the nature of its ties to an external audience; and a contingent theory of social influence may be necessary to characterize diffusion processes correctly, particularly when external and time‐varying nonnetwork factors have significant effects.

Schaefer	American Journal of Sociology	113	1	2007-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 205-242	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Despite the prevalence of generalized exchange in social life, few studies have investigated the classic anthropological prediction that generalized (indirect) exchange produces greater social solidarity than restricted (direct) exchange. Building on recent work comparing negotiated and reciprocal forms of direct exchange, the authors develop a theory of reciprocity in exchange. The theory argues that two structural characteristics of reciprocity distinguish among all three forms of exchange and affect the emergence of social solidarity through three causal mechanisms. Experimental results provide strong support for the causal logic of the theory and for the predicted ordering of subjective dimensions of solidarity across the three forms of exchange, with generalized indirect exchange > reciprocal direct exchange > negotiated direct exchange.

Weber, however, has remained an enigma in this respect. This article addresses Weber’s approach to the environment, including its significance for his interpretive-causal framework and his understanding of capitalism. For Weber, sociological meanings were often anchored in biophysical realities, including climate change, resource consumption, and energy scarcity, while environmental influences were refracted in complex ways within cultural reproduction. His work thus constitutes a crucial key to constructing a meaningful postexemptionalist sociology.

However, this assumption ignores the ways in which the meanings of genetic research are conditional on its position in sequences of events. Based on analyses of three conditions for which at least one putative gene or genetic marker has been identified, this article argues that critical junctures in the institutional stabilization of phenotypes and the mechanisms that sustain such classifications over time configure the practices and meanings of genetic research. Path dependence is critical to understanding the lack of consistent fit between genetics and medicalization.

The study uses questions about perceptions of neighborhood crime from surveys in Chicago, Seattle, and Baltimore, matched with census data and police department crime statistics. The percentage young black men in a neighborhood is positively associated with perceptions of the neighborhood crime level, even after controlling for two measures of crime rates and other neighborhood characteristics. This supports the view that stereotypes are influencing perceptions of neighborhood crime levels. Variation in effects by race of the perceiver and implications for racial segregation are discussed.

Bianchi, Wendy Wang	American Journal of Sociology	117	5	2012-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1422-1459	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Previous literature suggests a tenuous link between fathers’ care of children and maternal employment and earnings. This study shows that the link is stronger when measures of caregiving capture fathers’ increased responsibility for children. The analysis of time diary data from 6,572 married fathers and 7,376 married mothers with children under age 13 indicates that fathers (1) engage in more “solo” care of children when their wives are employed, (2) are more likely to do the kind of child care associated with responsibility for their children when their wives spend more time in the labor market, and (3) participate more in routine care when their wives contribute a greater share of the couple’s earnings. In addition, the “father care” to “mother care” ratio rises when mothers contribute a greater share of household earnings.

This raises the question of the place of genetics in social science explanations. Genomic causation is described from a counterfactualist perspective, which makes its complexity plain and highlights the distinction between identifying causes and substantiating explanations. For explanation, genomic causes must be understood as strictly mediated by the body. One implication is that the challenge of behavioral genetics for sociology is much more a challenge from psychology than biology, and a main role for genetics is as a placeholder for ignorance of more proximate influences of psychological and other embodied variation. Social scientists should not take this challenge from psychology as suggesting any especially fundamental explanatory place for either it or genetics, but the contingent importance of genetic and psychological characteristics is itself available for sociological investigation.

The theory is formulated within the framework of earlier work on status construction by Ridgeway and others and uses the mathematical framework of the theory of status characteristics and expectation states. This theory describes how an initially nonvalued characteristic can acquire status value and generalized expectation states from its association with already established and valued status elements. The authors derive eight theorems from their theory that describe different conditions under which the initially nonvalued characteristic acquires such status value. They consider illustrative applications of the theory and some research that is relevant to the formulation. The authors then conclude with a discussion of the implications of their formulation for the general understanding of status organizing processes.

Results from time-series analyses suggest that criminal deportations increase during times of rising unemployment, and this effect is partly mediated by an elevated discourse about immigration and labor. An especially strong association between deportations and unemployment emerges from 1941 through 1986, a period in which the federal law enforcement bureaucracy and deportation laws were well established and judges retained substantial discretion. After 1986, changes in criminal deportation rates mirror the trend in incarceration rates. The study connects the burgeoning sociological literatures on immigration and punishment, revealing a historically contingent effect of labor markets on the criminal deportation of noncitizen offenders.

Kelly	American Journal of Sociology	112	4	2007-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1203-1243	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Most employers installed sexual harassment grievance procedures and sensitivity training by the late 1990s. It was personnel experts, not courts, legislatures, or lawyers, who promoted these antiharassment strategies, drawn from the profession's tool kit. Personnel succeeded because it was executives, not public officials, who defined professional jurisdiction, and executives proved susceptible to personnel's argument that bureaucratic routines could reduce legal risk. With each landmark in harassment law, more employers adopted the grievance procedures personnel advocated despite negative reviews from lawyers. Employers who consulted personnel experts were more likely to join the bandwagon; those who consulted lawyers were less likely. The case holds lessons for the evolution of professions, because executives play an increasing role in defining professional jurisdiction.

In view of the overwhelming influence of China and India on trends in global inequality change, the authors base their strategy on estimating the change in world average within-country inequality from change in within-country inequality of these two countries. The authors find that global inequality decreased continuously throughout the period. They also project that global inequality will likely rise again in the next 25 years unless the stellar economic performance of China and India spreads widely to other developing countries.

It demonstrates that a stable and significant transnational field of political action connecting immigrants with their polities of origin does indeed exist. The results help temper celebratory images of the extent and effects of transnational engagement provided by some scholars. The article shows that migrants’ habitual transnational political engagement is far from being as extensive, socially unbounded, “deterritorialized,” and liberatory as previously argued. Transnational political action, then, is regularly undertaken by a small minority, is socially bounded across national borders, occurs in quite specific territorial jurisdictions, and appears to reproduce preexisting power asymmetries. The potential of transnationalism for transforming such asymmetries within and across countries has yet to be determined.

Penner	American Journal of Sociology	118	3	2012-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 676-727	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The authors link the literature on racial fluidity and inequality in the United States and offer new evidence of the reciprocal relationship between the two processes. Using two decades of longitudinal data from a national survey, they demonstrate that not only does an individual’s race change over time, it changes in response to myriad changes in social position, and the patterns are similar for both self-identification and classification by others. These findings suggest that, in the contemporary United States, microlevel racial fluidity serves to reinforce existing disparities by redefining successful or high-status people as white (or not black) and unsuccessful or low-status people as black (or not white). Thus, racial differences are both an input and an output in stratification processes; this relationship has implications for theorizing and measuring race in research, as well as for crafting policies that attempt to address racialized inequality.

In the model, individuals assign an a priori social value to an innovation which evolves during their interactions with the “relative agreement” influence model. This model offers the possibility of including a minority of “extremists” with extreme and very definite opinions. Individuals who give a high social value to the innovation tend to look for information that allows them to evaluate more precisely the individual benefit of adoption. If the social value they assign is low, they neither consider the information nor transmit it. The main finding is that innovations with high social value and low individual benefit have a greater chance of succeeding than innovations with low social value and high individual benefit. Moreover, in some cases, a minority of extremists can have a very important impact on the propagation by polarizing the social value.

Although this proposition is a core element of the “glass ceiling” metaphor, it has failed to gain strong support in previous research. The article establishes a firm theoretical foundation for expecting an increasing female disadvantage, with an eye toward defining the scope conditions and extending the model to upper‐level external hires. The approach is illustrated in an empirical setting that meets the proposed scope conditions: corporate law firms in the United States. Results confirm that in this setting, the female mobility disadvantage is greater at higher organizational levels in the case of internal promotions, but not in the case of external hires.

John Levi Martin	American Journal of Sociology	111	2	2005-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 408-446	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Using a set of network data from a large number of naturally occurring groups, this study seeks to determine whether powerful people are more likely to be seen as sexy by others than are persons without power. In particular, this study disentangles two aspects of power that are often confused, namely power as a dyadic relationship and power as an individual characteristic or position (which the author calls “status”). Most sociological theories that predict a relationship between power and sexiness argue that the connection will involve men of high status being sexier—or at least more attractive as partners—to women than will men of low status. While this study finds that there is indeed a connection between sexiness and power, it is instead women whose high status increases their sexiness (to men), while it is the interpersonal power of men that makes them sexy, both to men and to women.

Michael Gaddis	American Journal of Sociology	118	4	2013-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 943-979	The University of Chicago Press	fla		It is widely believed that impoverished contexts harm children. Disentangling the effects of family background from the effects of other social contexts, however, is complex, making causal claims difficult to verify. This study examines the effect of exposure to classroom poverty on student test achievement using data on a cohort of children followed from third through eighth grade. Cross-sectional methods reveal a substantial negative association between exposure to high-poverty classrooms and test scores; this association grows with grade level, becoming especially large for middle school students. Growth models, however, produce much smaller effects of classroom poverty exposure on academic achievement. Even smaller effects emerge from student fixed-effects models that control for time-invariant unobservables and from marginal structural models that adjust for observable time-dependent confounding. These findings suggest that causal claims about the effects of classroom poverty exposure on achievement may be unwarranted.

But, for states to be successful in fostering development, they need a considerable degree of internal cohesiveness, which is generally supplied by the presence of a robust, Weberian bureaucratic corps. This article argues that, while internal cohesiveness is indeed critical, bureaucratic rule following can produce results in the opposite direction, depending on the interagency relations that obtain within the state. The effect of interagency relations is demonstrated through an examination of India and Korea. Both have worked to foster industrialization, and both are endowed with relatively healthy bureaucracies. However, the Indian state was paralyzed and fragmented, while its Korean counterpart did secure the requisite internal coherence. Not only did the culture of rule following fail to generate a cohesive state in India, but it, in fact, worked against such an outcome.

Connectivity between source and destination points is an inherent aspect of migrations, but migration networks generate a multiplicity of “imagined communities,” organized along different, often conflicting principles. Consequently, what immigration scholars describe as transnationalism is usually its opposite: highly particularistic attachments antithetical to those by‐products of globalization denoted by the concept of “transnational civil society.” Moreover, migrants do not make their communities alone: states and state politics shape the options for migrant and ethnic trans‐state social action. International migrants and their descendants do repeatedly engage in concerted action across state boundaries, but the use, form, and mobilization of the connections linking “here” and “there” are contingent outcomes subject to multiple political constraints.

Analysis of data from the National Survey of Families and Households and the 2003–7 waves of the American Time Use Survey shows that men who do “women’s work” in the market spend more time on male-typed housework relative to men in gender-balanced occupations and their wives spend more time on female-typed housework. Women in gender-atypical occupations also do more female-typed housework than women in gender-balanced occupations. The article provides clearer evidence about the important ways in which cultural conceptions of gender shape and are shaped by economic processes.

Hunter	American Journal of Sociology	118	2	2012-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 420-448	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Long-standing debates over the effect of socioeconomic status (SES) on environmental concern contrast postmaterialist and affluence arguments, suggesting a positive relationship in high-income nations, with counterarguments for a negative or near zero relationship. A diffusion-of-innovations approach adapts parts of both arguments and predicts initial adoption of proenvironmental views by high-SES groups; however, environmentalism diffuses over time to other SES groups, weakening the association. This argument is tested with General Social Survey data (1973–2008) across 83 cohorts, whose attitudes before, during, and after the emergence of environmentalism identify long-term changes in environmental concern. Multilevel age, period, and cohort models support diffusion arguments by demonstrating that the effects across cohorts of education, income, and occupational prestige first strengthen, then weaken. This finding suggests that diffusion of environmental concern first produces positive relationships consistent with postmaterialism arguments and later produces null or negative relationships consistent with global environmentalism arguments.

Actors seek coalitions that grant them the most advantageous exchange of taxation against public goods and of military support against political participation. Modeling historical data on the distribution of these resources in France and the Ottoman Empire from 1500 to 1900 shows that nation building results from strong state centralization and well-established civil societies; ethnic closure, from weak state capacity and civil societies; and populism, from medium centralization and weak civil societies. The results are consistent with French and Ottoman political histories of the 18th and 19th centuries.

It shows that private property has emerged as the predominant category of ownership in Hungary and explains the rapid diffusion of private ownership by focusing on the actions of the state and international agencies such as the International Monetary Fund and the European Union. Following the collapse of communism, state actors in Hungary promoted the domestic accumulation of capital by subsidizing the sale of state enterprises to private parties, particularly enterprise insiders. Pressures from international agencies ultimately forced government officials to abandon this policy, however, and to conform to a neoliberal model of the state that allowed direct foreign investment. The conclusion considers the capacity of states to intervene in economic processes in an environment increasingly dominated by suprastate agencies.

These changes in youth homicide rates are associated with two cohort characteristics that are theoretically linked to criminality: relative size of cohorts and the percentage of cohort members born to unwed mothers. These effects persist throughout the life span, are independent of age and historical period, and can explain fluctuations in homicide arrest rates before the recent upturn.

The authors argue that the expansion and openness of state institutions encourage the formation of associations. Moreover, the institutional structures of world society provide important resources and legitimation for association. Longitudinal cross-national data on voluntary associations are analyzed using panel models with fixed-effects and instrumental variables models to address possible endogeneity. Institutional features of the state and the structures of world society are linked to higher levels of association, as are wealth and education. These factors differentially affect specific types of association, helping make sense of the distinctive configurations of civil society observed around the globe.

It questions black-and-white conceptualizations of documented and undocumented immigration by exposing the gray area of "liminal legality" and examines how this in-between status affects the individual's social networks and family, the place of the church in immigrants' lives, and the broader domain of artistic expression. Empirically, it draws on ethnographic fieldwork conducted among Salvadoran and Guatemalan immigrants in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Phoenix from 1989 to 2001. The article lends support to arguments about the continued centrality of the nation-state in the lives of immigrants.

We show how to simulate Markov graph distributions based on assumptions about simple local social processes. We examine the resulting global structures against appropriate Bernoulli graph distributions and provide examples of stochastic global “worlds,” including small worlds, long path worlds, and nonclustered worlds with many four‐cycles. In light of these results we suggest a locally specified social process that produces small world properties. In examining movement from structure to randomness, parameter scaling produces a phase transition at a “temperature” where regular structures “melt” into stochastically based counterparts. We provide examples of “frozen” structures, including “caveman” graphs, bipartite structures, and cyclic structures.

The authors estimate the black‐white gap in hourly wages from 1980 to 1999 adjusting for the sample selection effect of labor inactivity. Among working‐age men in 1999, accounting for labor inactivity—including prison and jail incarceration—leads to an increase of 7%–20% in the black‐white wage gap. Adjusting for sample selectivity among men ages 22–30 in 1999 increases the wage gap by as much as 58%. Increasing selection bias, which can be attributed to incarceration and conventional joblessness, explains about two‐thirds of the rise in black relative wages among young men between 1985 and 1998. Apparent improvement in the economic position of young black men is thus largely an artifact of rising joblessness fueled by the growth in incarceration during the 1990s.

This group of models is the categorical analogue of latent‐variable regression for continuous latent variables such as those employed in LIS‐REL or LISCOMP; therefore, though never yet employed in sociological research, the potential usefulness of these models in such research is very high. These models are regression extensions of log‐linear latent‐class models with group variables. An application focuses on predictors of three latent classes of gender‐role attitudes among Japanese women. These classes are labeled “traditional gender‐role supporters”, “prowork gender‐equality supporters”, and “antiwork gender‐equality supporters”. The analysis illustrates the usefulness of the method by identifying the characteristics of each class compared with the others. Other possible applications of the models are also discussed.

Class analysis extends institutionalism by highlighting an additional source of cultural transposition—a generalized identity summarized here as “business citizenship.” Institutionalism, in turn, shows how civic associations worked to unify employers and foster an overarching class consciousness. The case study provides an overview of class formation among Cincinnati employers and illustrates how business citizenship carried over from the realms of political reform and high culture to personnel management and industrial training. Some comparative observations suggest this pattern of class formation and cultural transposition was typical.

The data source is the white male DNA sample in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The authors' empirical gene‐environment interaction analysis produces a robust protective effect of the 9R/9R genotype relative to the Any10R genotype in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1). This protective effect tends to be lost in schools in which higher proportions of students start having sex early, as well as in individuals with relatively low cognitive ability. The genetics‐informed sociological analysis here suggests that explaining a human trait or behavior may require a theory that accommodates the complex interplay between social contextual and individual influences and genetic predispositions.

In seeking to explain the different outcomes of these similar social movements, the authors draw upon the global commodity chains (GCC) literature to extend the understanding of the economic and industry‐related openings and closures social movements face as they seek to promote social change. This analysis not only illustrates the importance of economic structures and organization for movement outcomes, but also shows how the economic sphere is culturally constituted. In this fashion, it broadens the social movement literature’s understanding both of the way that political economy matters to movement efficacy and of the way that cultural processes infuse the economic sphere. The study advances the GCC literature by showing how GCCs are cultural as well as economic constructs.

Under this legislation, programs are encouraged to teach that nonmarital sex is likely to have harmful psychological effects. Life course concepts and identity theory suggest that sex may be consequential for the mental health of some adolescents. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this article investigates mental health consequences of adolescent sex. The analyses reveal important contingencies of the effect of first sex. Timing relative to age norms, romantic relationship factors, and gender interact to condition the effect of first sex on mental health. While some adolescents experience mental health decrements, the majority of those who had first sex did not. This finding highlights the importance of considering contingencies when investigating the effects of life events on mental health.

Nath	American Journal of Sociology	109	5	2004-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1137-1176	The University of Chicago Press	fla		U.S. emotion culture contains beliefs that women are more emotional and emotionally expressive than men and that men and women differ in their experience and expression of specific emotions. Using data from the 1996 emotions module of the GSS, the authors investigate whether men and women differ in self‐reports of feelings and expressive behavior, evaluating whether the patterns observed for men and women are consistent with cultural beliefs as well as predictions from two sociological theories about emotion and two sociological theories about gender. Surprisingly, self‐reports do not support cultural beliefs about gender differences in the frequency of everyday subjective feelings in general. Men and women do, however, differ in the frequency of certain positive and negative feelings, which is explained by their difference in social position. The implications of the findings for theory and research on both gender and emotion are discussed.

Using over‐time analysis of the adoption of these programs in 389 U.S. organizations, historical research, and interviews with human resources managers, this study demonstrates that organizations added dependent care expense accounts in response to changes in tax law and, in particular, to the creative interpretation by benefits consultants of a seemingly concrete and clear law. Although the tax break included in the 1981 Economic Recovery Tax Act was intended to spur employers to create child care centers, these programs are still rare. This article extends institutional theories of law and organizations by arguing that interested actors create, as well as respond to, uncertainty in the law.

Expanding on old debates, these data and analyses validate the importance of organizational and class cohesion approaches to corporate political action. Methodologically, the political unity of pairs (dyads) of firms in trade policy activism is analyzed with quadratic assignment procedure regression. Shared membership in prominent policy networks and board interlocks positively predict corporate political unity across three areas of trade policy influence, from the executive branch to the legislature. Non-network organizational indicators also significantly predicted corporate trade policy activism. The findings support business unity accounts of corporate political action and suggest that higher levels of firm embeddedness within intercorporate networks facilitate collective corporate political action.

Abraham, Sara Helms, Stanley Presser	American Journal of Sociology	114	4	2009-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1129-1165	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The authors argue that both the large variability in survey estimates of volunteering and the fact that survey estimates do not show the secular decline common to other social capital measures are caused by the greater propensity of those who do volunteer work to respond to surveys. Analyses of the American Time Use Survey (ATUS)—the sample for which is drawn from the Current Population Survey (CPS)—together with the CPS volunteering supplement show that CPS respondents who become ATUS respondents report much more volunteering in the CPS than those who become ATUS nonrespondents. This difference is replicated within subgroups. Consequently, conventional adjustments for nonresponse cannot correct the bias. Although nonresponse leads to estimates of volunteer activity that are too high, it generally does not affect inferences about the characteristics of volunteers.

Americans are not as isolated as the most extreme recent estimates suggest. However, hopes that “bridging” social capital is more common in broader acquaintanceship networks than in core networks are not supported. Instead, the entire acquaintanceship network is perceived by Americans to be about as segregated as the much smaller network of close ties. People do not always know the religiosity, political ideology, family behaviors, or socioeconomic status of their acquaintances, but perceived social divisions on these dimensions are high, sometimes rivaling racial segregation in acquaintanceship networks. The major challenge to social integration today comes from the tendency of many Americans to isolate themselves from others who differ on race, political ideology, level of religiosity, and other salient aspects of social identity.

This article offers some philosophical and theo‐retical justifications for the use of general theory in historical analy‐sis and contends that general theory guides the selection of facts, provides a source of generalizable causal mechanisms, facilitates the cumulation of knowledge across substantive domains, reveals anom‐alies that lead to new questions, and creates the conditions under which existing theories can be supplanted by superior ones. The au‐thors further outline the concrete research practices that flow from their approach and discuss several empirical studies that exemplify these five advantages.

The authors describe three ideal-typical inequality regimes (big-class, microclass, and gradational) and identify the mechanisms driving a shift toward or away from each of them. Using GSS and CPS data on 39 measures of life chances, attitudes, and behaviors, the authors find that big-class inequality is in decline whereas microclass inequality has remained stable. Moreover, big classes are simplifying into largely economic aggregates, whereas microclasses remain more complicated moral configurations that cannot be understood in terms of economic standing.

However, existing perspectives on U.S. welfare policy development grant little explanatory power to the role of culture. For this reason, they cannot adequately explain the dynamics of an important, but frequently overlooked, episode in American welfare state history: the rise and fall of guaranteed annual income proposals in the 1960s and 1970s. The author outlines three mechanisms—schematic, discursive, and institutional—through which culture can influence policy outcomes. He then argues that cultural categories of worthiness affected welfare policy development through their constitutive contribution to cultural schemas, their deployment by actors as resources in expert deliberation and public discourse, and their institutionalization in social programs that reinforced the symbolic and programmatic boundaries between categories of the poor. The author discusses how these cultural mechanisms can be integrated with existing class‐ and institution‐based accounts of welfare policy development.

Explanations relying on altered political opportunity structures or resources, accounts of Cesar Chavez's charismatic leadership, or descriptions of UFW strategy fail to identify mechanisms for creating effective strategy. By analyzing leadership, organizational influences on actors' choices, and their interaction within the environment, this study shows that greater access to salient information, heuristic facility, and motivation generated more effective strategy. Differences in "strategic capacity" can explain how resourcefulness can compensate for lack of resources, why some new organizations can overcome the "liability of newness," and how reorganizational "focal" moments may lead to a social movement.

Optimal matching and qualitative analyses                     are used to show how the careers are shaped by workplace structures and by the                     early 1970s enforcement of women's employment rights. Changing opportunity                     structures in turn shaped respondents' perspectives. Many younger respondents                     were unaware that their mobility was partly due to the creative action of their                     female predecessors and took personal credit for their own rapid progress.                     Finally, it appears that as women have experienced more freedom in pursuing                     finance careers, their career trajectories have become more rigid.

Analysis of Community Development Block Grant data in the San Francisco Bay Area reveals significant inequality in grants making to immigrant organizations across central cities and suburbs. With data from 142 interviews and documentary evidence, the authors elaborate how a history of continuous migration builds norms of inclusion and civic capacity for public-private partnerships. They also identify the phenomenon of “suburban free riding” to explain how and why suburban officials rely on central city resources to serve immigrants, but do not build and fund partnerships with immigrant organizations in their own jurisdictions. The analysis affirms the importance of distinguishing between types of immigrant destinations, but argues that scholars need to do so using a regional lens.

Cross-classified multilevel growth-curve models are applied to 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and U.S. Census Bureau data to demonstrate how people adjust to changing local labor market conditions throughout their careers. The key findings indicate that substitution and complementary effects depend on the stage of the worker’s career. At entry into the labor market, high levels of immigration have a positive effect on the career paths of young native-born adults. However, negative contemporaneous effects to natives’ earnings tend to offset positive point-of-entry effects, a finding that suggests job competition among natives is greater in areas of high immigrant population concentration. These results raise questions about whether foreign-born workers need to be in direct competition with natives for there to be substitution effects.

It argues that Afro-Colombian activists were able to seize upon changes in global policy norms around multiculturalism and state disequilibrium both by deploying traditional social movement strategies and by framing their demands in terms of ethnic difference. This case extends our understanding of how social movements make strategic use of political openings and also illustrates the circumstances under which an ethnic difference framing can be a more effective political strategy for achieving rights for black populations than a racial equality framing.

Walder	American Journal of Sociology	106	5	2001-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1371-1408	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Core features of mobility regimes are obscured by models common in comparative research. Party patronage in China is apparent only in the timing of career events. Elites are chosen from among party members, but only some are eventually chosen. Those who join the party while young enter a career path that includes sponsorship for adult education and more likely promotion. While the party's preference for youth from “red” classes has yielded to one for prior education, party sponsorship endures. Because patronage blurs distinctions between politics and merit, it confounds interpretations of returns to individual attributes.

This article explores the individual impact of social movement participation using longitudinal qualitative research with working‐class Palestinian women and argues that there exists among these former participants a “feminist generation” that is differentiated by a gender‐egalitarian ideology and a high sense of self‐efficacy. The article also argues that feminist subjectivities and possibilities will be circumscribed and difficult to maintain without the structural and cultural support provided by a stable, sovereign, and at least nominally democratic state and accountable feminist organizations that are responsive to diverse groups of women.

Soule	American Journal of Sociology	117	6	2012-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1674-1722	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article examines the diffusion of protest tactics among social movement organizations (SMOs) through their collaboration in protest groups. Using a longitudinal data set of SMO protest activity between 1960 and 1995, the authors adapt novel methods for dealing with two forms of selection and measurement bias in network analysis: (i) the mechanism that renders some SMOs more likely to select into collaboration and (ii) the notion that diffusion is an artifact of homophily or indirect learning rather than influence. The authors find that collaboration is an important channel of tactical diffusion and that SMOs with broader tactical repertoires adopt more tactics via their collaboration with other SMOs, but only up to a point. Engaging in more collaboration also makes SMOs more active transmitters and adopters of new tactics. Finally, initial overlap in respective tactical repertoires facilitates the diffusion of tactics among collaborating SMOs.

McFarland	American Journal of Sociology	107	3	2001-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 612-678	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Critical and resistance theorists propose that race and class backgrounds influence everyday forms of student resistance in schools. This article argues that the microsocial process of student defiance is less characterized by individual traits of race and class than by the formal and informal organizational characteristics of social settings. Using unique data on resistance in multiple schools and classrooms, this article finds that defiant behaviors arise when instructional formats give students access to public discourse and when students have advantaged social network relations. Social opportunities of tasks, coupled with political opportunities of networks, enable students to consistently undermine and redirect classroom affairs. The results suggest that resistant behavior is more the result of organizational features of social networks and instruction than “alienation” factors, and is therefore rectifiable through classroom management.

Collins	American Journal of Sociology	104	2	1998-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 293-338	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The meaning of scientific "data" depends on the "evidential culture" of laboratories. Using transcripts of interviews and conversations with scientists, open and closed evidential cultures are analyzed under three dimensions. For example, an Italian laboratory's evidential collectivism and an American laboratory's evidential individualism are contrasted. In this case–the detection of gravitational radiation–evidential cultures are found to be homologous with institutional settings. The data interpretation of the long‐standing small science is being influenced by the growing global dominance of a new big science. The interesting technique of "involuntary blinding" has been used to enforce a uniform approach.

Yasumoto	American Journal of Sociology	104	3	1998-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 642-686	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Differences in transactions within and outside of cohesive subgroups are hypothesized to be a function of actors' pursuit of different forms of social capital. In an example of the French financial elite, subgroups are identified based on the pattern of friendships, and graphical representations establish the descriptive link between social structure and action. Estimates from multilevel models quantify the extent to which actors abstain from hostile action against subgroup members but tend to support others not in their subgroup. These complementary findings establish the subgroup as a critical mesolevel entity, defined by the social structure while affecting action.

Springer	American Journal of Sociology	107	3	2001-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 768-807	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article seeks to understand the effects of welfare‐state spending on infant mortality rates. Infant mortality was chosen for its importance as a social indicator and its putative sensitivity to state action over a short time span. Country fixed‐effects models are used to determine that public health spending does have a significant impact in lowering infant mortality rates, net of other factors, such as economic development, and that this effect is cumulative over a five‐year time span. A net effect of health spending is also found, even when controlling for the level of spending in the year after which the outcome is measured (to account for spurious effects or reverse causation). State spending affects infant mortality both through social mechanisms and through medical ones. This article also shows that the impact of state spending may vary by the institutional structure of the welfare state. Finally, this study tests for structural breaks in the relationship between health spending and infant mortality and finds none over this time period.

This article addresses this theoretical question by assessing how the interracial unions of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, as opposed to the racially exclusionist affiliates of the American Federation of Labor, affected the level of employment equality between black and white workers during the 1940s. The study finds that in the 37 nonsouthern states, and especially in the 15 highly unionized states, the stronger the CIO unions were, the more equal were the reductions in the unemployment rates of white and black workers during 1940–50.

Pescosolido	American Journal of Sociology	118	1	2012-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 134-175	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This study examines how dynamics surrounding biographical disruptions compare to more routine fluctuations in personal social networks. Using data from the Indianapolis Network Mental Health Study, the authors track changes in patients’ social networks over three years and compare them to a representative sample of persons with no self-reported mental illness. Overall, individuals at the onset of treatment report larger and more broadly functional social networks than individuals in the population at large. However, the number of network ties among the latter increases over time, whereas network size decreases slightly among people using mental health services. As individuals progress through treatment, less broadly supportive ties drop out of extended networks, but a core safety net remains relatively intact. The findings in this case provide evidence that social network dynamics reflect changing needs and resources: persons labeled with psychiatric disorders learn to manage illness, with functionality driving social interaction in times of biographical disruption.

Multilevel models based on data from the National Neighborhood Crime Study for 7,622 neighborhoods in 79 cities throughout the United States reveal that segregation is positively associated with violent crime for white and various types of nonwhite neighborhoods. Nonetheless, there is a lack of parity in violence across these types of communities reflecting the larger racialized social system in which whites are able to use their privileged position to reside in the most advantaged neighborhoods, while African‐Americans and Latinos live in the most disadvantaged urban communities and therefore bear the brunt of urban criminal violence.

Rudel	American Journal of Sociology	115	1	2009-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 129-154	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Humans transformed landscapes at an unprecedented scale and pace during the 20th century, creating sprawling urban areas in affluent countries and large‐scale agricultural expanses in tropics. To date, attempts to explain these processes in other disciplines have had a disembodied, ahistorical quality to them. A sociological account of these changes emphasizes the role of strategic actions by states and coalitions of interested parties in transforming landscapes. It identifies the agents of change and the timing of transformative events. Case studies of suburban sprawl and tropical deforestation illustrate the value of the sociological approach and the wide range of situations to which it applies.

The author finds that a much wider range of institutions engage in affirmative action for African‐American students than previous analysts reported, and that a growing number of institutions extend the benefits of affirmative action to Hispanic students. Colleges and universities are markedly less enthusiastic about engaging in affirmative action for socioeconomically disadvantaged students. To understand why postsecondary institutions prefer students from particular minority groups over otherwise comparable white students, the author introduces the concept of compensatory sponsorship (building on Turner’s ideal‐type of sponsored mobility). In a contest system perceived by many to disadvantage some competitors unfairly, college personnel engage in affirmative action both to right a perceived wrong and to preserve the legitimacy of the contest. The beneficiaries of compensatory sponsorship, however, are determined by historical and social forces that constrain how postsecondary institutions recruit, admit, and fund potential matriculants.

Modernists are more individualistic than the orthodox in seeing individuals, not a deity, as responsible for their fates and as the ultimate moral arbiters. The authors hypothesize that modernists are also economically individualistic in believing that the poor or jobless, not the community or state, should solve their own problems. The authors find that on economic concerns, modernists are far more likely to be to the right of the orthodox than to the left.

This article outlines reasons why one might expect to find declining class inequalities in educational attainment, and, using a large data set, the authors analyze educational inequality among cohorts born in the first two‐thirds of the 20th century in eight European countries. They find, as expected, a widespread decline in educational inequality between students coming from different social origins. Their results are robust to other possible choices of method and variables, and the authors offer some explanations of why their findings contradict Shavit and Blossfeld’s conclusions.

Intergenerational Mobility across Levels of Schooling in the United States	Florencia Torche	American Journal of Sociology	117	3	2011-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 763-807	The University of Chicago Press	fla		A quarter century ago, an important finding in stratification research showed that the intergenerational occupational association was much weaker among college graduates than among those with lower levels of education. This article provides a comprehensive assessment of the “meritocratic power” of a college degree. Drawing on five longitudinal data sets, the author analyzes intergenerational mobility in terms of class, occupational status, earnings, and household income for men and women. Findings indicate that the intergenerational association is strong among those with low educational attainment; it weakens or disappears among bachelor’s degree holders but reemerges among those with advanced degrees, leading to a U-shaped pattern of parental influence. Educational and labor market factors explain these differences in mobility: parental resources influence college selectivity, field of study, and earnings more strongly for advanced-degree holders than for those with a bachelor’s degree alone.

This article traces a portion of the rise of racial inequality in incarceration in northern and southern states to increasing rates of African-American migration to the North between 1880 and 1950. It employs three analytical strategies. First, it introduces a decomposition to assess the relative contributions of geographic shifts in the population and regional changes in the incarceration rate to the increase in racial disparity. Second, it estimates the effect of the rate of white and nonwhite migration on the change in the white and nonwhite incarceration rates of the North. Finally, it uses macro- and microdata to evaluate the mechanisms proposed to explain this effect.

Stuart	American Journal of Sociology	106	6	2001-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1546-1588	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Sociological investigations of economic exchange reveal how institutions and social structures shape transaction patterns among economic actors. This article explores how interfirm networks in the U.S. venture capital (VC) market affect spatial patterns of exchange. Evidence suggests that information about potential investment opportunities generally circulates within geographic and industry spaces. In turn, the circumscribed flow of information within these spaces contributes to the geographic‐ and industry‐localization of VC investments. Empirical analyses demonstrate that the social networks in the VC community—built up through the industry’s extensive use of syndicated investing—diffuse information across boundaries and therefore expand the spatial radius of exchange. Venture capitalists that build axial positions in the industry’s coinvestment network invest more frequently in spatially distant companies. Thus, variation in actors’ positioning within the structure of the market appears to differentiate market participants’ ability to overcome boundaries that otherwise would curtail exchange.

First, riots are not independent events, and modeling them as such results in an inadequate understanding of the violence wave. Second, cities not only have differential intrinsic propensities to riot, but also different levels of responsiveness and resistance to diffusion from other riots. Third, implied networks related to mass media distribution provide the pathway along which riot diffusion is transmitted. These combined results underscore the necessity of conceptualizing riots as a series of interdependent events, which diffuse in different patterns depending on the characteristics of the riot and the city in which it occurs, and they further accentuate the paramount importance of the mass media in creating and sustaining collective violence and protest waves.

Three major dimensions‐‐historical context, social heterogeneity, and, most important, biographical pacing, measured by cohort, gender, and career pathway, respectively‐‐operate simultaneously, yet unevenly, to affect various aspects of the retirement process. Findings suggest that changes over the past few decades have undermined the regularity in retirement timing that was a product of the convergence of diverse institutional features, anchored by a large core of men on traditional career tracks. Focusing on retirement, our model underscores the multiplex nature of the temporal structuring of the life course.

Studies on philanthropy do examine donors but tend to focus on microlevel factors to explain their behavior. This study, in contrast, draws on institutional theory to show that macrolevel factors affect donor behavior. It also extends the institutional framework by examining the field‐level configurations in which donors and fundraisers are embedded. Employing the case of workplace charity, this new model highlights how the composition of the organizational field structures fundraisers and donors alike, shaping fundraisers’ strategies of solicitation and, therefore, the extent of donor control.

Marsh	American Journal of Sociology	106	2	2000-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 281-302	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Using his ideal‐types of the rationalization of legal systems, Max Weber classified modern Western European law as formally rational, traditional Chinese law as substantively irrational. In light of recent research by specialists in pre‐20th‐century Chinese law, Weber is shown to have had several serious misunderstandings. Chinese officials’ arbitrary discretion in judicial decision making was much more limited than Weber thought, and what limited it was not primarily “sacred tradition,” but officials’ obligation to adjudicate according to the written law. There was more legal expertise in the system than Weber realized. By the time of the Ch’ing dynasty (1644–1912), China’s legal system approximated Weber’s substantively rational type more than the substantively irrational type. Finally, Weber’s model for formally rational law—the “conceptual jurisprudence” of late‐19th‐century German civil law—is no longer regarded as the model for modern law. Therefore, students of comparative law who wish to build from Weber’s ideal‐types need to rethink what the defining characteristics of “modern law” should be.

Two radically different expectations about their growth are plausible: on the one hand, the rise of the feminist movement, which militates against gender distinctions, would suggest androgynous names increasing in recent decades. On the other hand, cross-cultural research indicates that first names designate gender more frequently than any other characteristic of a child or its family, suggesting a minimal increase. Examining data for all white births in Illinois in every year from 1916 through 1989 produces paradoxical results. Overall use of androgynous names is barely increasing; however, the disposition to use androgynous names has increased among parents of daughters. Analysis of the accidental ways in which androgynous names develop, their special characteristics, and their asymmetric growth patterns, leads to viewing the androgynous process as collective behavior that can be fruitfully examined through the perspective of the Schelling residential segregation model. The minimal increase in androgyny reflects a gender contamination effect that may be operating in a variety of other domains as well.

A framework built around consumption-oriented groups would facilitate progress toward a more general theory of consumption. This article reintroduces and extends Weber’s “budgetary unit” concept to address this gap, correcting key problems dogging the consumption literature. The budgetary unit concept (1) offers a new framework for theorizing and better accounting for observed consumption patterns, (2) reveals how consumption units have organizational logics, preferences, strengths, and vulnerabilities that are consequentially distinct from market logic of production and profit, and (3) focuses attention on social processes and features enabling theorization of general social patterns of consumption across diverse contexts. This article highlights the explanatory power and broad applicability of Weber’s budgetary unit approach using the conventionally dissimilar cases of Russian organized crime, Catholic nuns, immigrant remittances, and low-income families’ child support.

This article emphasizes the imputed identities of sources to argue that difficult-to-categorize outputs were appealing when associated with a source high in disconnectedness. Worldwide data on recordings and mobility with detailed data on Midwest recordings provide evidence that jazz from cities high in disconnectedness was rerecorded more often by musicians over time. Moreover, recordings with difficult-to-categorize elements were more likely to be rerecorded when coming from cities high in disconnectedness, despite evidence that original music was paradoxically less likely to come from these cities.

When immigrant parents choose a first name for their child that is common in their host society, they show a high degree of acculturation. In contrast, selecting a name common only in the parents’ country of origin indicates ethnic maintenance. Using data from the German Socio‐economic Panel for Turkish, Southwest European, and former Yugoslav immigrants, the authors show that acculturation in terms of name giving depends on several factors: the cultural boundary between the country of origin and the host society, the parents’ sociostructural integration in terms of education and citizenship, interethnic networks, and religious affiliation.

Grusky	American Journal of Sociology	118	5	2013-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1330-1374	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Is the third industrial revolution indeed driven by rising payoffs to skill? This simple but important question has gone unanswered because conventional models of earnings inequality are based on exceedingly weak measurements of skill. By attaching occupational skill measurements to the 1979–2010 Current Population Surveys, it becomes possible to adjudicate competing accounts of the changing returns to cognitive, creative, technical, and social skill. The well-known increase in between-occupation inequality is fully explained when such skills are taken into account, while returns to schooling prove to be quite stable once correlated changes in workplace skills are parsed out. The most important trend, however, is a precipitous increase in the wage payoff to synthesis, critical thinking, and related “analytic skills.” The payoff to technical and creative skills, often touted in discussions of the third industrial revolution, is shown to be less substantial.

Ridgeway, Kristan Glasgow Erickson	American Journal of Sociology	106	3	2000-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 579-615	The University of Chicago Press	fla		In this article, two experiments support status construction theory's claim that interaction spreads status beliefs through behavior, creating a diffusion process that makes widely shared beliefs possible. The first demonstrates that people who hold a status belief can “teach” it by treating the other in accord with the belief. The second shows that third‐party participants who witness such behavioral treatments also acquire the status belief. The first experiment also verifies a general mechanism by which interaction creates status beliefs: nominally different participants developed shared status beliefs about the difference from the repeated enactment of influence hierarchies corresponding to the difference. This general mechanism suggests that any structural condition that gives one group a systematic advantage in gaining influence over another group in intergroup encounters will foster the development of widely shared status beliefs favoring the advantaged group.

Precise images and measures of network structure are derived from reports of relationships that occurred over a period of 18 months between 1993 and 1995. The study offers a comparison of the structural characteristics of the observed network to simulated networks conditioned on the distribution of ties; the observed structure reveals networks characterized by longer contact chains and fewer cycles than expected. This article identifies the micromechanisms that generate networks with structural features similar to the observed network. Implications for disease transmission dynamics and social policy are explored.

The author examines the contradictory literature on the theory specifically in relation to black‐white intermarriage and offers three explanations for the divergent findings. First, black‐white inequality has obscured the actual status homogamy typifying intermarriage. Second, gender differences among young couples have been mistaken for racially specific patterns of exchange. Third, the empirical findings that appear to support status‐caste exchange are not robust. The author’s conclusions favor the simplest tabular analyses, which cast doubt on status‐caste exchange theory.

Erlanger	American Journal of Sociology	105	2	1999-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 406-54	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Most accounts of organizations and law treat law as largely exogenous and emphasize organizations' responses to law. This study proposes a model of endogeneity among organizations, the professions, and legal institutions. It suggests that organizations and the professions strive to construct rational responses to law, enabled by "rational myths" or stories about appropriate solutions that are themselves modeled after the public legal order. Courts, in turn, recognize and legitimate organizational structures that mimic the legal form, thus conferring legal and market benefits upon organizational structures that began as gestures of compliance. Thus, market rationality can follow from rationalized myths: the professions promote a particular compliance strategy, organizations adopt this strategy to reduce costs and symbolize compliance, and courts adjust judicial constructions of fairness to include these emerging organizational practices. To illustrate this model, a case study of equal employment opportunity (EEO) grievance procedures is presented in this article.

However, focusing upon weak ties as one important type of interracial contact, we show how reallocation of students among schools for desegregation may reduce opportunities for interracial contact. We analyze this apparent paradox and show that it is a member of the mathematical family of phenomena known as class size paradoxes. Then, we consider policy implications for schools and theoretical implications for understanding intergroup relations, and we suggest the need for empirical research to determine the practical value of applying the theory in this complex context.

The article describes the medical community’s understanding of tetracycline and how the drug was marketed. This situational analysis finds no reasons to expect social contagion; instead, aggressive marketing efforts may have played an important role. The Medical Innovation data set is reanalyzed and supplemented with newly collected advertising data. When marketing efforts are controlled for, contagion effects disappear. The article underscores the importance of controlling for potential confounds when studying the role of social contagion in innovation diffusion.

Choi, Roman David	American Journal of Sociology	117	4	2012-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1172-1201	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Dealing with personnel inherited from prior regimes in the administration of transitional states is critical for democratic consolidation, a problem traditionally addressed by the dichotomy of continuation or dismissal. However, major organizational innovations to deal with tainted officials appear in postcommunist Central Europe. Using the concept of lustration systems, this study differentiates three archetypes: dismissal, exposure, and confession. The authors propose that each system carries different symbolic meanings, which produce different outcomes for citizens’ trust in government and in tainted officials. The hypothesized effects of different lustration systems on trust are tested by an experiment embedded in nationwide representative surveys conducted in the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland. The results show that dismissal and confession increase citizens’ trust in government and trust in tainted officials. However, exposure reduces citizens’ trust in tainted officials.

We argue that entrepreneurship is less about importing ideas than about generating new knowledge by recombining resources. In contrast to the brokerage-plus-closure perspective, we address the overlapping of cohesive group structures. In analyzing the network processes of intercohesion, we identify a distinctive network topology: the structural fold. Actors at the structural fold are multiple insiders, facilitating familiar access to diverse resources. Our data set records personnel ties among the largest 1,696 Hungarian enterprises from 1987 to 2001. First, we test whether structural folding contributes to group performance. Second, because entrepreneurship is a process of generative disruption, we test the contribution of structural folds to group instability. Third, we move from dynamic methods to historical network analysis and demonstrate that coherence is a property of interwoven lineages of cohesion, built up through repeated separation and reunification.

However, interviews with 95 Filipino domestic workers in the Philippines, Hong Kong, and Singapore reveal how these low-capital migrants can intentionally follow a stepwise international migration trajectory, working their way up a hierarchy of destination countries and accumulating sufficient migrant capital in the process so as to eventually gain legal entry into their preferred destinations, often in the West. Such a trajectory differs from more frequently studied migration patterns in its number of stages, duration, intentionality, hierarchical progression, and dynamic nature.

Using qualitative comparative analysis to assess ethnographically derived data on the 15 SMOs, the study highlights the importance of organizational viability and the rhetorical quality of diagnostic and prognostic frames for securing outcomes while identifying a contingent relationship between tactics and political environment. The analysis suggests that there are multiple pathways leading to movement outcome attainment, and therefore unidimensional rather than combinatorial and interactive approaches are misguided.

Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in five manufacturing plants, the author seeks to overcome this limitation by exploring the nature and effects of workers’ responses to the changes they confront in their work situations. Although the data suggest ways in which outcomes rested on structural attributes, they also reveal that worker agency shaped the fate of workplace transformation in subtle yet decisive ways. Developing a fourfold typology of workers’ responses, the author shows how each type affected the path down which workplace change evolved. These findings suggest that workplace transformation should be approached as a relational phenomenon whose outcome hinges on the orientations and practices that workers themselves adopt when confronting the restructuring of their jobs.

Belief systems may be quantified in terms of their degree of consensus (the degree to which all group members agree) and their degree of “tightness” (the degree to which holding some belief implies holding or not holding other beliefs). Two theoretical claims link the production of tightness and consensus to formal properties of social structure. Cognitive authority is hypothesized to produce tightness, as beliefs that are in the same domain of authoritative judgment may be connected via webs of implications. The clarity of the power structure is hypothesized to produce consensus, as an inability to conceive of alternatives to the domestic order translates into an inability to conceive of alternatives in beliefs. These claims are tested with data on 44 naturally occurring communities.

A blockmodel analysis of one aboriginal tribe yields sections that serve as marriage classes in a generalized exchange system, though the norms that govern kinship would fail to manifest, if followed, a cycle for exchange. Generalized exchange systems emerge from inequalities exogenous to the kinship system, specifically gerontocracy. Models of norms are weak predictors of actual exchange structures. Models of relations yield insight into the etiology of systems that build social solidarity from social exchange.   When I was in my mother's womb, social structure seemed a simple thing.

The effects of family network ties on individual migration are estimated while controlling for measured and unmeasured conditions that influence migration risks for all family members. Results suggest that social network effects are robust to the introduction of controls for human capital, common household characteristics, and unobserved conditions. Estimates also confirm the ancillary hypothesis, which states that diffuse social capital distributed among community and household members strongly influences the likelihood of out‐migration, thus validating social capital theory in general and the network hypothesis in particular.

Goldstone, Bert Useem	American Journal of Sociology	104	4	1999-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 985-1029	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Prisons have long been used as a testing ground for social theory. This article explores the applicability of state‐centered theories of revolution to the phenomena of prison riots. Prison riots are found to have numerous features in common with revolutions, including prior administrative crises, elite (guard) alienation and divisions, and a widespread popular (prisoner) sense of injustice and grievances regarding (prison) administration actions (not just toward imprisonment per se). The state‐centered theory provides a better “fit” to prison riots than current functionalist, rising expectation, or management theories.

Evidence from the General Social Survey indicates that higher fertility and earlier childbearing among women from conservative denominations explains 76% of the observed trend for cohorts born between 1903 and 1973: conservative denominations have grown their own. Mainline decline would have slowed in recent cohorts, but a drop‐off in conversions from conservative to mainline denominations prolonged the decline. A recent rise in apostasy added a few percentage points to mainline decline. Conversions from mainline to conservative denominations have not changed, so they played no role in the restructuring.

Brown	American Journal of Sociology	119	2	2013-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 394-443	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article introduces a racialized conflict theory to explain how racial divisions structure welfare state development in the absence of de jure discrimination. The author explains the effect of racial divisions on policy outcomes as the result of the attitudinal, cultural, and political spillover effects of prevailing conflicts in a social field. Using a paired-case comparison and analysis of multiple data sources, the author applies this theory to analyze Georgia’s and Alabama’s surprisingly divergent welfare reforms in the 1990s. Results support the racialized conflict theory and suggest important revisions to prevailing theories about the sociopolitical effects of contemporary racial divides.

To determine the causes of that historic decline, we focus on income inequality across nations and find that the major equalizing force is faster‐than‐world‐average income growth in China and South Asia, industrializing regions where 40% of the world’s people live. Apparently what matters most about economic globalization thus far is its role in the spread of industrialization throughout populous poor regions of the world. If so, then globalization most likely has reduced global income inequality. This decline is anticipated to continue over the next few decades, first, because of the continued industrialization of poor regions and, second, because most of the growth in the world’s working‐age population will occur in poor regions.

The authors extend research on intermovement relations by examining the influence of ascendant militancy of the new left–inspired mass movement wave on the organizational fortunes of labor. Time‐series models buttressed by secondary historical evidence show that “the movement,” as radical flank, did stimulate a militant oppositional culture that moved from the streets into workplaces. That oppositional culture was especially significant in the public sector, where it fueled union recognition strikes which, in turn, helped push the extension of collective bargaining laws in that sector, opening the door for union growth. The authors consider implications for social movement theory and labor movement revitalization.

Mare	American Journal of Sociology	112	3	2006-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 667-709	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article examines the relationships between the residential choices of individuals and aggregate segregation patterns. Analyses based on computational models show that high levels of segregation occur only when individuals’ preferences follow a threshold function. If individuals make finer‐grained distinctions among neighborhoods that vary in racial composition, preferences alone do not lead to segregation. Vignette data indicate that individuals respond in a continuous way to variations in the racial makeup of neighborhoods rather than to a threshold. Race preferences alone may be insufficient to account for the high levels of segregation observed in American cities.

Little problematized, however, is the extent to which access leads to mobilization and the social context within which social capital activation occurs. Employing in‐depth interviews of 105 low‐income African‐Americans, this work advances the literature in two ways. First, it suggests that what we have come to view as deficiencies in access among the black urban poor may have more to do with functional deficiencies of their job referral networks. Second, the findings from this study lay the groundwork for a single, multilevel conceptual framework within which to understand social capital activation, a framework that takes into consideration properties of the individuals, dyads, and communities of residence.

Macy	American Journal of Sociology	115	2	2009-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 451-490	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Prevailing theory assumes that people enforce norms in order to pressure others to act in ways that they approve. Yet there are numerous examples of “unpopular norms” in which people compel each other to do things that they privately disapprove. While peer sanctioning suggests a ready explanation for why people conform to unpopular norms, it is harder to understand why they would enforce a norm they privately oppose. The authors argue that people enforce unpopular norms to show that they have complied out of genuine conviction and not because of social pressure. They use laboratory experiments to demonstrate this “false enforcement” in the context of a wine tasting and an academic text evaluation. Both studies find that participants who conformed to a norm due to social pressure then falsely enforced the norm by publicly criticizing a lone deviant. A third study shows that enforcement of a norm effectively signals the enforcer’s genuine support for the norm. These results demonstrate the potential for a vicious cycle in which perceived pressures to conform to and falsely enforce an unpopular norm reinforce one another.

Viterna	American Journal of Sociology	112	1	2006-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1-45	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Using a rare representative sample of grassroots activists and nonactivists, this study identifies three paths that consistently led Salvadoran women to involvement in the FMLM guerrilla army: politicized guerillas, reluctant guerillas, and recruited guerillas. These mobilization paths arose from the patterned intersections of individual‐level biographies, networks, and situational contexts. The implications of these findings extend beyond studies of revolutionary activism to analyses of microlevel mobilization in general. Activists are heterogeneous and often follow multiple paths to the same participation outcome. Capturing these multiple paths is imperative for generating theoretically sound explanations of mobilization that are also empirically effective in distinguishing activists from nonactivists.

The framework also identifies population events, such as births, that influence the environment. The authors use longitudinal, multilevel, mixed-method measures of local land use changes, population dynamics, and social organization to test this framework. These tests reveal that changes in social organization are strongly associated with changes in land use independent of measures of population size, affluence, and technology. Also, local birth events shape local land use changes and key proximate determinants of land use change.

This paper explores the effect of those pledges on the transition to first intercourse. Adolescents who pledge are much less likely to have intercourse than adolescents who do not pledge. The delay effect is substantial. On the other hand, the pledge does not work for adolescents at all ages. Second, pledging delays intercourse only in contexts where there are some, but not too many, pledgers. The pledge works because it is embedded in an identity movement. Consequently, the pledge identity is meaningful only in contexts where it is at least partially nonnormative. Consequences of pledging are explored for those who break their promise. Promise breakers are less likely than others to use contraception at first intercourse.

Mayer	American Journal of Sociology	107	1	2001-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1-32	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This study estimates the effect of changes in economic inequality between 1970 and 1990 on children’s educational attainment. Data on individual children from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics is combined with other data on state characteristics. Growing up in a state with widespread economic inequality increases educational attainment for high‐income children and lowers it for low‐income children. Most of the effect is due to factors unassociated with family income or economic segregation in the state. These other factors include state spending for schooling and the increase in the returns to schooling over this period.

Correll	American Journal of Sociology	106	6	2001-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1691-1730	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article develops a supply‐side mechanism about how cultural beliefs about gender differentially influence the early career‐relevant decisions of men and women. Cultural beliefs about gender are argued to bias individuals' perceptions of their competence at various career‐relevant tasks, controlling for actual ability. To the extent that individuals then act on gender‐differentiated perceptions when making career decisions, cultural beliefs about gender channel men and women in substantially different career directions. The hypotheses are evaluated by considering how gendered beliefs about mathematics impact individuals' assessments of their own mathematical competence, which, in turn, leads to gender differences in decisions to persist on a path toward a career in science, math, or engineering.

This article argues that role theory would provide a better metatheoretical perspective on embeddedness. A preliminary sketch of role theory suggests a promising theoretical methodology. To illustrate, I construct a repeated‐game model in which the players are not individuals but roles (a profit‐maximizing “businessperson” and nonstrategic “friend”); the businessperson role acts strategically in light of a metatule that governs intrapersonal role switching.

Restructuring work around team work and weaker job boundaries can improve women’s and minorities’ visibility and reduce stereotyping and thus should reduce their career disadvantage. Proponents of bureaucratic formalization argue, in contrast, that relaxing formal job definitions and emphasizing social relations at work will deepen ascriptive disadvantage. The reorganization of work in corporate America over the last two decades provides a test case. Using unique data on the life histories of more than 800 organizations, the author examines whether alleviating job segregation leads to better career outcomes for women and minorities. This study finds that when employers adopt popular team and training programs that increase cross‐functional collaboration, ascriptive inequality declines. Similar programs that do not transcend job boundaries do not lead to such increases. The results point to different effects at the intersection of gender and race.

Although their proposed upward‐redistributive policy would benefit few voters, it won the support of 31 state legislatures. To explain this outcome, this article offers a theory of strategic policy crafting by advocacy groups. Such groups may succeed even in otherwise unfavorable institutional environments if they craft their proposals to fit the salient policy context. Archival evidence and event history analysis support this hypothesis. Public opinion also helps explain legislative support for upward‐redistributive policy.

And under what conditions will intended or unintended outcomes occur as a result? This article addresses these questions by applying a dynamic model that depicts the 1989 Chinese student movement as a three-iteration game with incomplete information. In this model, the Chinese government is willing ultimately to suppress the student resistance by force, but since it is playing a two-level game, it conceals its preferences as private information while initially choosing not to use force. In the end, many demonstrators died believing that the People's Liberation Army would never harm the Chinese people. This model suggests how an information gap can lead to unintended and undesirable outcomes, even when actors behave rationally.

However, the mechanisms producing these effects are seldom examined explicitly. This article examines one such mechanism—employee turnover. Analyzing a sample of high‐technology start‐ups, we show that changes in the employment models or blueprints embraced by organizational leaders increase turnover, which in turn adversely affects subsequent organizational performance. Turnover associated with organizational change appears to be concentrated among the most senior employees, suggesting “old guard disenchantment” as the primary cause. The results are consistent with the claim of neoinstitutionalist scholars that founders impose cultural blueprints on nascent organizations and with the claim of organizational ecologists that altering such blueprints is disruptive and destabilizing.

DiPrete	American Journal of Sociology	108	2	2002-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 267-309	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The analysis of intergenerational mobility has primarily used measures of social position that are functions of an individual’s occupation. Occupation‐based models of social mobility, however, have limitations that arguably have grown in recent decades. Meta‐analysis of available evidence for Sweden, western Germany, and the United States concerning occupational mobility, household income mobility, job displacement, union dissolution, and poverty dynamics shows the limitations of the individual‐level occupation‐based career‐trajectory approach to life course mobility. This article develops an alternative formulation at the household level, which focuses on cross‐national variation in the extent to which societal institutions influence the rate of events with the potential to change a household’s life conditions via the manipulation of incentives for mobility‐generating events, and the extent to which they mitigate the consequences of these events through social insurance. The combination of these institutional processes produces the distinctive characteristics of the mobility regimes of these countries.

In contrast, this article investigates certain alternative, more “consentful” forms of contention, in which citizens openly contested official directives by appealing to the state's own dominant ideology. Drawing on evidence from the German Democratic Republic, as well as other cases, the article develops a dramaturgical framework that classifies contentious repertoires along three dimensions: behavior, standpoint, and stance. This framework is then used to analyze two types of data: a retrospective “resistance” narrative by an ordinary citizen and a secret transcript from the well‐known Biermann protest. The conclusion proposes an explanatory model, as well as a regime typology to aid future research.

Data from a first‐of‐its‐kind 25‐city survey suggest that political embeddedness, defined broadly as bureaucratic, instrumental, or affective ties to the state and its actors, helps Chinese lawyers survive their everyday difficulties, such as routine administrative interference, official rent seeking, and police harassment and intimidation. The article draws the ironic conclusion that legal practice in China reveals at least as much about the enduring salience of socialist institutions as it does about incipient capitalist and “rule of law” institutions. Lawyers' dependence on state actors both inside and outside the judicial system preserves the value of political connections inside the very institutions that some sociologists have argued are responsible for obviating the need for such guanxi.

Moreover, contemporary theories about political opportunity and resources often inadequately address the issue of motivation. To address these shortcomings, this article examines 20 communities that are “at risk” for mobilization because they face controversial proposals for large energy infrastructure projects. Movements emerge in only 10 cases, allowing for the identification of factors that drive mobilization or nonmobilization. Utilizing insights from social psychology, the authors contend that community context shapes motivations to oppose or accept a proposal, not objective measures of threat.

Harding	American Journal of Sociology	109	3	2003-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 676-719	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article investigates the causal effects of neighborhood on high school dropping out and teenage pregnancy within a counterfactual framework. It shows that when two groups of children, identical at age 10 on observed factors, experience different neighborhoods during adolescence, those in high‐poverty neighborhoods are more likely to drop out of high school and have a teenage pregnancy than those in low‐poverty neighborhoods. Causal inferences from such associations have been plagued by the possibility of selection bias. Using a new method for sensitivity analysis, these effects are shown to be robust to selection bias. Unobserved factors would have to be unreasonably strong to account for the associations between neighborhood and the outcomes.

Thornton, William Ocasio	American Journal of Sociology	105	3	1999-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 801-843	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article examines the historical contingency of executive power and succession in the higher education publishing industry. We combine interview data with historical analysis to identify how institutional logics changed from an editorial to a market focus. Event history models are used to test for differences in the effects of these two institutional logics on the positional, relational, and economic determinants of executive succession. The quantitative findings indicate that a shift in logics led to different determinants of executive succession. Under an editorial logic, executive attention is directed to author‐editor relationships and internal growth, and executive succession is determined by organization size and structure. Under a market logic, executive attention is directed to issues of resource competition and acquisition growth, and executive succession is determined by the product market and the market for corporate control.

Hermsen, Reeve Vanneman	American Journal of Sociology	117	1	2011-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 259-289	The University of Chicago Press	fla		After becoming consistently more egalitarian for more than two decades, gender role attitudes in the General Social Survey have changed little since the mid-1990s. This plateau mirrors other gender trends, suggesting a fundamental alteration in the momentum toward gender equality. While cohort replacement can explain about half of the increasing egalitarianism between 1974 and 1994, the changes since the mid-1990s are not well accounted for by cohort differences. Nor is the post-1994 stagnation explained by structural or broad ideological changes in American society. The recent lack of change in gender attitudes is more likely the consequence of the rise of a new cultural frame, an “egalitarian essentialism” that blends aspects of feminist equality and traditional motherhood roles.

An empirical typology of family workdays is built using a variant of optimal matching, and three kinds of family time are taken into account: conjugal time, father‐ and mother‐child time, and parents‐child time. The results indicate that off‐scheduling is an unintentional by‐product of employers’ economic interests and that, since it reduces conjugal and parents‐child time but fails to foster temporal complementarity between parents, it is a negative factor for family solidarity.

But how do the children of migrants raised in the parents’ adopted country develop ties to the parental home country? Using a structural equation model and data from a recent survey of adult immigrant offspring in Los Angeles, this article shows that second-generation cross-border activities are strongly affected by earlier experiences of and exposure to home country influences. Socialization in the parental household is powerful, transmitting distinct home country competencies, loyalties, and ties, but not a coherent package of transnationalism. Our analysis of five measures of cross-border activities and loyalties among the grown children of migrants shows that transmission is specific to the social logic underlying the connection: activities rooted in family relationships such as remitting are transmitted differently than emotional attachments to the parents’ home country.

Education and marriage increase the likelihood of leaving poor tracts, while age, home ownership, and receiving public assistance reduce it. Blacks are substantially less likely than whites to escape poor tracts and substantially more likely to move into them, even after socioeconomic status is controlled. Residential segregation by race and poverty status and the supply of new housing in the metropolis also influence the likelihood of moving between distressed and nondistressed neighborhoods.

Jorgenson, Brett Clark	American Journal of Sociology	118	1	2012-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1-44	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Ecological modernization theory posits that even though economic development harms the environment, the magnitude of the harmful link decreases over the course of development. In contrast, the treadmill of production theory argues that the strong relationship between environmental harms and economic development will remain constant or possibly increase through time. To evaluate these competing propositions, interactions between economic development and time are used in cross-national panel analyses of three measures of carbon dioxide emissions. The results vary across the three outcomes as well as between developed and less developed countries, providing mixed support for both theoretical perspectives. The authors conclude by discussing how both theories could benefit from engaging contemporary research concerning changes within the transnational organization of production and the structure of international trade and how these global shifts influence environment/economic development relationships.

This article contributes to the understanding of this relationship by exploring how religious affiliation affects wealth ownership for conservative Protestants (CPs). The results demonstrate that religion affects wealth indirectly through educational attainment, fertility, and female labor force participation. The results also provide evidence of a direct effect of religion on wealth. Low rates of asset accumulation and unique economic values combine to reduce CP wealth beyond the effects of demographics. The findings improve understanding of the relationship between religious beliefs and inequality.

The authors advance the literature by examining whether geographic differences in black economic and political threat explain the effects of %black and racial segregation on police size. They also examine the potential mediating roles of whites' fear of crime and antiblack prejudice. The results show that whites' fear and perceived economic threat account for more than one‐third of the effect of %black on police size. They also find a significant positive effect of segregation on police size that is not accounted for by the intervening mechanisms considered. The findings are partially consistent with the minority threat perspective, but also suggest that it does not fully explain the link between racial context and crime control.

Morenoff	American Journal of Sociology	108	5	2003-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 976-1017	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This study addresses two questions about why neighborhood contexts matter for individuals via a multilevel, spatial analysis of birth weight for 101,662 live births within 342 Chicago neighborhoods. First, what are the mechanisms through which neighborhood structural composition is related to health? The results show that mechanisms related to stress and adaptation (violent crime, reciprocal exchange and participation in local voluntary associations) are the most robust neighborhood‐level predictors of birth weight. Second, are contextual influences on health limited to the immediate neighborhood or do they extend to a wider geographic context? The results show that contextual effects on birth weight extend to the social environment beyond the immediate neighborhood, even after adjusting for potentially confounding covariates. These findings suggest that the theoretical understanding and empirical estimation of “neighborhood effects” on health are bolstered by collecting data on more causally proximate social processes and by taking into account spatial interdependencies among neighborhoods.

Following the world‐system, world‐society, and neoinstitutional perspectives in sociology, they assume that states are in cultural, political, and economic competition with each other, thereby seeking to maintain their position and status, frequently by adopting organizational forms or practices that make them isomorphic with their environment. The authors predict that countries boost the independence of their central bank from the political power as their exposure to foreign trade, investment, and multilateral lending increases. They also model the cross‐national dynamic process of diffusion of central bank independence by examining the impact of cohesive and role‐equivalent trade relationships between countries. They find support for their hypotheses with information on 71 countries between 1990 and 2000.

Tests of hypotheses derived from minority threat theory and minority voting power stipulating quadratic relationships between minority presence and roll call votes for liberal legislation in the House of Representatives are conducted.

Additional findings suggest that expansions in the murder rates produced decreased support for liberal policies. Statements by Republican campaign officials on how they deliberately used mass resentments against minorities to gain normally Democratic votes provide evidence about the intervening connections between the threat to white dominance posed by larger minority populations and reduced support for liberal legislation.

Employers who use such hiring methods are quintessential "social capitalists," viewing workers' social connections as resources in which they can invest in order to gain economic returns in the form of better hiring outcomes. Identified are three ways through which such returns might be realized: the "richer pool," the "better match," and the "social enrichment" mechanisms. Using unique company data on the dollar costs of screening, hiring, and training, this article finds that the firm's investment in the social capital of its employees yields significant economic returns.

President Kennedy’s decision to impose a blockade was based on hours of discussions with top advisers (the so-called ExComm), yet decades of scholarship on the crisis have missed the central puzzle: How did the group select one response, the blockade, when all options seemed bad? Recently released audio recordings are used to argue that the key conversational activity was storytelling about an uncertain future. Kennedy’s choice of a blockade hinged on the narrative “suppression” of its most dangerous possible consequence, namely the perils of a later attack against operational missiles, something accomplished through omission, self-censorship, ambiguation, uptake failure, and narrative interdiction. The article makes the very first connection between the localized dynamics of conversation and decision making in times of crisis, and offers a novel processual account of one of the most fateful decisions in human history.

In contrast, this article demonstrates how coordinator elites who forge relationships within communal networks act as a counterweight to more cosmopolitan brokers, representing local interests. Evidence from new archival data on credit networks and political mobilization in Revolutionary Vermont shows that such local powerholders used their strategic position in economic networks to gain influential political offices. Moreover, coordinators strengthened local political factions that linked to national politics without eroding the interests of local communities.

A unique data set on migration and protest in the East German revolution of 1989–90 is used to analyze county‐level variations in exit and voice alongside indicators of political loyalty, social movement organization, and social and economic conditions.

Gerber	American Journal of Sociology	111	6	2006-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1816-1870	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Wage arrears have played an important, yet unappreciated role in the stratification of contemporary Russian society. Delays in wage payments became rampant and persistent during the 1990s because of the particular structural, institutional, and policy context that accompanied Russia’s market reforms. Recent improvements in Russia’s economy have reduced but not eliminated wage arrears, an innovative practice that has become institutionalized in some, but not all, postsocialist societies. Analyses of survey data collected in early 1998 confirm the independent stratifying role of arrears. Inequality in getting paid is socially structured in a different manner than inequality in contracted wages, and the former proves equally or more decisive in shaping inequality in actual wages. Arrears occur with some regularity in other national and historical contexts. This study of Russia shows that, where arrears are rampant, researchers should incorporate them into conceptual and empirical models of earnings inequality, and it offers an example of how that might be done.

The present article attempts to resolve some of the issues raised in these debates by developing a distinction between universal and historically conditional theory through a contrast between work by such leaders of the revived comparative historical tradition as Charles Tilly, Theda Skocpol, and Immanuel Wallerstein and selected works by second‐generation comparative historical sociologists. The conditional theories of the second generation incorporate narrative and conjunctural temporality, theory‐driven comparison, and historically conditional generalization that were not emphasized in the universalizing theories and comparisons of the first generation.

This simplistic view of the policy process runs the risk of masking how movements and other factors matter at various stages of the policy process. Each stage is characterized by different rules and different consequences; thus, movements and other factors ought to matter differently at each stage. The authors examine three stages of policy development with regard to state ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment. Results show that movements mattered more to legislative decisions in the earlier stages of the policy process, but that their effects were eclipsed in later stages by public opinion.

One such instance is an episode of contention by Irish political prisoners in the late 1970s. The “blanketmen” appropriated and then built a solidary culture within spaces that had been under official control. Their ability to maintain such a collective response was enhanced by an intensifying cycle of protest and violent reprisal, including extreme stripping of their material environment, in which the prisoners gained considerable initiative. This study uses interviews and contemporary writings by prisoners, prison authorities, visitors, and movement activists to examine how the dynamic of protest and repression transformed insurgent prison culture—through material, emotional, and perceptive changes—and the importance of leadership in the transformation. Special attention is given to prisoner activities in appropriated spaces that reinforced the culture of resistance: promoting the Irish language, cultural production, and the production of propaganda.

The authors analyzed the small world network of the creative artists who made Broadway musicals from 1945 to 1989. Using original arguments, new statistical methods, and tests of construct validity, they found that the varying “small world” properties of the systemic‐level network of these artists affected their creativity in terms of the financial and artistic performance of the musicals they produced. The small world network effect was parabolic; performance increased up to a threshold, after which point the positive effects reversed.

Drawing on core insights from the sociology of scientific knowledge, it highlights, and then challenges, a fundamental principle underlying our understanding of technological risk: a realist epistemology that tacitly assumes that technological knowledge is objectively knowable and that “failures” always connote “errors” that are, in principle, foreseeable. From here, it suggests a new conceptual tool by proposing a novel category of man-made calamity: the “epistemic accident,” grounded in a constructivist understanding of knowledge. It concludes by exploring the implications of epistemic accidents and a constructivist approach to failure, sketching their relationship to broader issues concerning technology and society, and reexamining conventional ideas about technology, accountability, and governance.

I argue that this is due to a firm’s bargaining power, which increases with the firm’s competitive strength. I find strong support using data on 50 years of Silicon Valley law firms and attorneys. Young, small, specialist, and low‐status firms are more likely to fail but are also contexts with the highest promotion likelihood. Moreover, except for those firms that are “near death,” an associate’s promotion likelihood increases with the law firm’s probability of failure.

Ross	American Journal of Sociology	112	5	2007-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1339-1382	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This study looks for evidence of an adulthood trajectory of perceived control over one’s own life, and education’s role in shaping it. Vectors from a 1995–2001 U.S. survey of adults imply a much steeper trajectory than did previous cross‐sectional studies, peaking in late middle age rather than early adulthood. They also show a trend toward larger increases in younger cohorts. Education influences the trajectory, particularly the level at which it begins. Estimates show an increase of .60 standard deviations with a four‐year increase in education. The sense of control also increases more outside of school the higher the level of education.

From structural images of voyages organized by shipping seasons, the authors map (over time and space) the emergence of dense, fully integrated, global trade networks to reveal globalization long before what is now called “globalization.” The authors show that the integration of the world trade system under the aegis of the EIC was the unintended by‐product of systematic individual malfeasance (private trading) on the part of ship captains seeking profit from internal Eastern trade.

Higher rates of unemployment and lower‐status occupational positions could account for the negative effect of single‐mother families on children's attainment throughout the period. Children from single‐father families and stepfamilies have consistently had lower attainments than children from both two‐biological‐parent and single‐mother families. The influence of many other dimensions of children's family background declined from the 1960s to the 1980s but has declined no further since. Among six candidate theoretical frameworks, the findings are most consistent with an evolutionary view of parental investment.

Martin, John D. McCarthy	American Journal of Sociology	114	1	2008-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 35-76	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Analysts have shown increased interest in how social movements use tactical repertoires strategically. While the state is most often the guarantor of new benefits, many movements—from labor to the environmental movement—target corporate, educational, and other institutions. Employing a unique data set of protests reported in the New York Times (1960–90), this research examines how repertoires are, in part, contingent on the institutional target a movement selects. In particular, the authors consider the role of each target's vulnerabilities and its capacities for response—repression, facilitation, and routinization—as explanations for the degree of transgressive protest each target faces. The results provide strong evidence for considering targets as a central factor in shaping forms of social protest.

Title VII prohibited employment discrimination, but the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission was granted scant enforcement resources. Yet the early EEOC aggressively enforced and developed Title VII. To solve the anomaly, the authors integrate insights from the literatures on social movements and the sociology of law. In the absence of conventional administrative resources, apparently weak state agencies can expand their capacity through the legal strategy of broad statutory construction. This strategy is more likely with the presence of social movement pressure from below. The authors argue that state capacity is a “moving target,” with state and societal actors building on legal as well as administrative resources to construct and transform capacity. By reconceptualizing state capacity, the authors contribute to nuanced explanations of state policy that are both “political” and “institutional” and that highlight the centrality of legal interpretation and judicial review to political sociology.

Despite such changes, however, the notion that young people will eventually “settle down” and desist from delinquent behaviors is remarkably persistent. This article unites criminology with classic work on age norms and role behavior to contend that people who persist in delinquency will be less likely to make timely adult transitions. The empirical analysis supports this proposition, with both arrest and self‐reported crime blocking the passage to adult status. The authors conclude that desisting from delinquency is an important part of the package of role behaviors that define adulthood.

Davis, Robert V. Robinson	American Journal of Sociology	114	5	2009-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1302-1349	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article examines four movements of the religiously orthodox that should have failed according to most social movement theory and research. The movements combine (1) an extraordinarily broad agenda, (2) a strict, morally absolutist ideology, and (3) a strong proscription against compromise with other groups, each of which has been identified as a liability that can lead to movement failure. Through inductive, qualitative analyses, the authors identify four shared strategies that helped these movements overcome these obstacles: bypassing the state, building grassroots structures, providing graduated membership, and reprioritizing agendas. Analyses of these movements also suggest that particular combinations of movement “liabilities” may actually be advantageous.

Logan, Deirdre Oakley, Jacob Stowell	American Journal of Sociology	113	6	2008-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1611-1644	The University of Chicago Press	fla		It has been argued that the effects of the desegregation of public schools from the late 1960s onward were limited and short‐lived, in part because of white flight from desegregating districts and in part because legal decisions in the 1990s released many districts from court orders. Data presented here for 1970–2000 show that small increases in segregation between districts were outweighed by larger declines within districts. Progress was interrupted but not reversed after 1990. Desegregation was not limited to districts and metropolitan regions where enforcement actions required it, and factors such as private schooling, district size, and inclusion of both city and suburban areas within district boundaries had stronger effects than individual court mandates.

Fernandez	American Journal of Sociology	107	2	2001-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 273-320	The University of Chicago Press	fla		One of the most popular explanations for the increased wage inequality that has occurred since the late 1970s is that technological change has resulted in a downward shift in the demand for low‐skill workers. This pattern is also alleged to account for the growth in racial inequality in wages over the same period. This article reports on a case study of the retooling of a food processing plant. A unique, longitudinal, multimethod design reveals the nature of the technological change, the changes in job requirements, and the mechanisms by which the changes affect the wage distribution for hourly production workers. This research finds that, indeed, the retooling resulted in greater wage dispersion and that the changes have also been associated with greater racial inequality in wages. However, contrary to the claims of advocates of the skill‐bias hypothesis, organizational and human resources factors strongly mediated the impact of the changing technology. Absent these “high road” organizational choices, this impact on wage distribution would have been even more extreme.

Through a synthesis with new institutionalism and sociolegal studies the author argues that production regimes using unfree labor are favorable for capitalist labor subordination given their particular historical embeddedness in legal institutions, the other alternatives available for exploitation and capitalists’ social embeddedness in local institutions. This is demonstrated through an analysis of how capitalists in the Victorian English pottery industry used law as a foundation for the construction of a factory regime based in unfree labor.

Cole	American Journal of Sociology	117	4	2012-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1131-1171	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Much research has shown human rights treaties to be ineffective or even counterproductive, often contributing to greater levels of abuse among countries that ratify them. This article reevaluates the effect of four core human rights treaties on a variety of human rights outcomes. Unlike previous studies, it disaggregates treaty membership to examine the effect of relatively “stronger” and “weaker” commitments. Two-stage regression analyses that control for the endogeneity of treaty membership show that stronger commitments in the form of optional provisions that allow states and individuals to complain about human rights abuses are often associated with improved practices. The article discusses the scholarly and practical implications of these findings.

Evans	American Journal of Sociology	116	2	2010-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 389-452	The University of Chicago Press	fla		How does collaboration between academic research and industry shape science? This article argues that companies' relative indifference to theory nudges their academic partners toward novel, theoretically unanticipated experiments. The article then evaluates this proposition using fieldwork, archival materials, and panel models of all academic research using the popular plant model Arabidopsis thaliana and the companies that support that research. Findings suggest that industry partnerships draw high-status academics away from confirming theories and toward speculation. For the network of scientific ideas surrounding Arabidopsis, industry sponsorship weaves discoveries around the periphery into looser, more expansive knowledge. Government funding plays a complementary role, sponsoring focused scientific activity in dense hubs that facilitate scientific community and understanding.

The analysis focuses on the role of state laws and regulations in the expansion of the mortgage‐backed securities markets and the development of real estate investment trusts (REITs). These institutional developments represent a series of ad hoc state efforts to “delocalize” residential and commercial property, and embed real estate financing within global capital markets. Rather than viewing globalization as weakening the state, the author argues that the U.S. state’s capacity to influence the degree and development of liquidity is a powerful mechanism of globalization.

The authors unpack racial homogeneity using a theoretical framework that distinguishes between various tie formation mechanisms and their effects on the racial composition of networks, exponential random graph modeling that can disentangle these mechanisms empirically, and a rich new data set based on the Facebook pages of a cohort of college students. They first show that racial homogeneity results not only from racial homophily proper but also from homophily among coethnics of the same racial background and from balancing mechanisms such as the tendency to reciprocate friendships or to befriend the friends of friends, which both amplify the homogeneity effects of homophily. Then, they put the importance of racial homophily further into perspective by comparing its effects to those of other mechanisms of tie formation. Balancing, propinquity based on coresidence, and homophily regarding nonracial categories (e.g., students from “elite” backgrounds or those from particular states) all influence the tie formation process more than does racial homophily.

Koput, Jason Owen‐Smith	American Journal of Sociology	110	4	2005-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1132-1205	The University of Chicago Press	fla		A recursive analysis of network and institutional evolution is offered to account for the decentralized structure of the commercial field of the life sciences. Four alternative logics of attachment—accumulative advantage, homophily, follow‐the‐trend, and multiconnectivity—are tested to explain the structure and dynamics of interorganizational collaboration in biotechnology. Using multiple novel methods, the authors demonstrate how different rules for affiliation shape network evolution. Commercialization strategies pursued by early corporate entrants are supplanted by universities, research institutes, venture capital, and small firms. As organizations increase their collaborative activities and diversify their ties to others, cohesive subnetworks form, characterized by multiple, independent pathways. These structural components, in turn, condition the choices and opportunities available to members of a field, thereby reinforcing an attachment logic based on differential connections to diverse partners.

This system, political semiosis, is able to identify and assess the performative speech acts, the demonstrative orientational specifications, and the mimetic representations required to advance historical transformations. The features of political semiosis structure the flow of historical events by managing the specific media and generic forms that are the vehicles through which events take shape. Political semiosis provides a method for analyzing both the circulation and the materialization of events. The exemplary case of September 11 illuminates this approach's capabilities.

Although most discussions of case study research presume that cases contribute to explanatory theory, this article draws from recent literature about ethical reasoning to argue that case studies can also contribute to normative theory—to theories about the ideals we should pursue and the obligations we should accept. This conclusion suggests that contrary to some views (notably Max Weber’s) social science has a vital role to play in the prescriptive study of values, particularly so‐called “thick ethical concepts” like “leadership,” “courage,” and “neighborhood vitality.”

This study utilizes 36 time use surveys from 19 countries (spanning 1965–2003) combined with original national‐level data in multilevel models to examine household task segregation. Analyses reveal that men do less and women do more time‐inflexible housework in nations where work hours and parental leave are long. Women do less of this work where there is more public child care and men are eligible to take parental leave. National context affects the character of gender inequality in the home through individual‐ and national‐level pathways.

Previous research focuses on three causal factors: (1) rising consumer affluence and its propensity to increase demand for services more than for manufactured goods, (2) faster productivity growth in the manufacturing sector relative to other sectors, and (3) expanding trade linkages between the North and the South of the global economy. The relative importance of these factors, however, is not fully understood, because previous research has not tested all of these explanations simultaneously nor considered the indirect channels through which global trade may cause deindustrialization. This study tests the three factors with two‐way fixed‐effects regression models and panel data on 18 OECD countries from 1970 to 2003. The results indicate that each factor makes significant contributions to deindustrialization, and that global trade exerts both direct and indirect effects on employment patterns in economically advanced countries, but that the single greatest factor comes from the steadily rising affluence of consumers in these countries.

How does widespread cynicism affect the culture of civic participation? What are the implications for democracy? This study synthesizes data from a one-year collective ethnography of seven civic groups and theoretical work on boundary making, ambiguity, and role distancing. The authors find skepticism generates “disavowal of the political,” a cultural idiom that allows people to creatively constitute what they imagine to be appropriate forms of engagement. Disavowal generates taboos, and the authors show how disdain for conflict and special interests challenges activism around inequality. Political disavowal both facilitates and constrains civic engagement in an era of political skepticism.

Focusing on the relative weights between wife’s and husband’s attributes in determining class identification for three class attributes (education, income, and occupational prestige) and on population heterogeneity in those weights, the study finds that men and women, on average, agree on how to weight the contributions of wife’s and husband’s income and occupation to subjectively identified class: wife’s income and husband’s income equally affect class identification but only husband’s occupational prestige—not wife’s—affects class identification. By contrast, men and women do not agree about the contributions of husband’s and wife’s education to subjectively identified class: education is a more individualized determinant of class, especially for men. The article also finds population heterogeneity in the weights: for example, self‐employed women and African‐American women have a more “independent” basis of class identification than do other employed women, and there is an interplay of gender role and self‐enhancement in class identification among couples where the wife has higher income than the husband. Theoretical implications of these findings are also discussed.

Nor has it systematically compared democratic revolutions with cases of authoritarian crackdown and chronic quiescence, despite the prevalence of these alternative outcomes. This article critiques the democratization literature's excessive focus on class actors and economic factors by highlighting the importance of emotive appeals to nationalist and religious sentiments and solidarities in sparking, sustaining, and sanctifying high‐risk protest against authoritarian governments. A comparative historical analysis of seven Southeast Asian countries reveals that democratic uprisings are more likely both to emerge and to succeed when communal elites—a society's primary possessors of nationalist and religious authority—assume an oppositional posture. Explaining variation in mobilization outcomes thus requires examining whether communal elites have gained political salience and retained political autonomy through long‐term processes of political development.

Four hypotheses are proposed regarding the effects of land distribution, collective ownership, and the organization of agricultural production on homicide rates. These hypotheses are tested using data from a census of all agricultural production units in a sample of Mexican municipalities. An unequal distribution of land is associated with higher rates of violence. Insecure property rights and the commodification of agricultural production are also conducive to more homicides. A fifth hypothesis is derived from a consideration of the state’s role in preventing violent conflict. In remote areas that historically have been far from the reach of the state, individuals are more likely to settle disputes violently. Topographical features are used to measure the accessibility of state institutions.

This article offers a general sociological approach to this question, using the economic value of nature as a paradigmatic case, and oil spills litigations in France and the United States as real world empirical illustrations. It suggests that a full-blown sociology of economic valuation must solve three problems: the “why,” which refers to the general place of money as a metric for worth; the “how,” which refers to the specific techniques and arguments laymen and experts deploy to elicit monetary translations; and the “then what” or the feedback loop from monetary values to social practices and representations.

Revolution produces bureaucratization only when the monitoring capacity of states is developed enough to make bureaucratic organization more efficient than alternatives such as tax farming and collection by local notables. As monitoring capacity varies across types of taxes and levels of administration, states also bureaucratize at different paces and are differentially affected by revolution. This explains why the revolutions in England and France had greater effects on indirect taxes than on direct taxes and at top levels of tax administration compared to lower levels. Thus, revolution is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for bureaucratization, but it contributes to the process by sweeping away impediments to reform.

Drawing on various theories of organization, the authors show how a merger wave exposed competing institutional logics and triggered the elaboration of the modern, mobile, bureaucratic career. Using organizational data and employment records, the authors model the association between organizational merger and the introduction of career‐migration among employees at Lloyds Bank over a 45‐year period. The pattern of mobility they find suggests that agency problems associated with the loyalties of newly acquired workers dominated early experiments with lateral transfers. As the merger wave matured, geographic mobility became a general feature of all bank workers’ careers. The implications of this pattern of mobility for organizations, career structures, and stratification systems more generally are examined.

King	American Journal of Sociology	113	5	2008-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1351-1393	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This research investigates the state social control of intergroup conflict by assessing the sociopolitical determinants of hate crime prosecutions. Consistent with insights from the political sociology of punishment, group‐threat accounts of intergroup relations and the state, and neoinstitutional theory, the findings suggest that hate crime prosecutions are fewer where political conservatism, Christian fundamentalism, and black population size are higher, although this last effect is nonlinear. Linkages between district attorneys' offices and communities, on the other hand, increase hate crime prosecutions and the likelihood of offices' creating hate crime policies. Yet these policies are sometimes decoupled from actual enforcement, and such decoupling is more likely in politically conservative districts. The results indicate that common correlates of criminal punishment have very different effects on types of state social control that are protective of minority groups, and also suggest conditions under which policy and practice become decoupled in organizational settings.

We argue that the increasing reliance on earnings realized through financial channels decoupled the generation of surplus from production, strengthening owners’ and elite workers’ negotiating power relative to other workers. The result was an incremental exclusion of the general workforce from revenue-generating and compensation-setting processes. Using time-series cross-section data at the industry level, we find that increasing dependence on financial income, in the long run, is associated with reducing labor’s share of income, increasing top executives’ share of compensation, and increasing earnings dispersion among workers. Net of conventional explanations such as deunionization, globalization, technological change, and capital investment, the effects of financialization on all three dimensions of income inequality are substantial. Our counterfactual analysis suggests that financialization could account for more than half of the decline in labor’s share of income, 9.6% of the growth in officers’ share of compensation, and 10.2% of the growth in earnings dispersion between 1970 and 2008.

Haynie	American Journal of Sociology	106	4	2001-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1013-1057	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This study examines whether structural properties of friendship networks condition the association between friends' delinquency and an individual's own delinquent behavior. Data from the Add Health allows a more accurate conceptualization of the peer network and a more rigorous measurement of peer delinquency than previous research. Findings from this study indicate that friends' delinquency is associated with an adolescent's own delinquency involvement. However, characteristics of adolescents' friendship networks, such as its density and adolescents' centrality and popularity, condition the delinquency‐peer association. Network density, in particular, emerges as an important component of the delinquency‐peer association, with very cohesive networks containing stronger delinquency‐peer associations than those that are less cohesive. These findings suggest that it is necessary to consider the underlying structural properties of friendship networks in order to understand the impact of peer influence on adolescent delinquency.

To explain this reversal, analysts focus on conditions within the colonized areas. By contrast, drawing on evidence from Spanish and British colonialism, the authors show that the economic models of the colonizing nations also affected the reversals of fortune. Mercantilist Spain tended to colonize most extensively precolonial regions that were populous and highly developed; in turn, extensive Spanish colonization had negative consequences for postcolonial development. In comparison, liberal Britain tended to colonize most extensively precolonial regions that were sparsely populated and underdeveloped; in turn, extensive British colonialism had comparatively positive effects. Thus, both Spain and Britain reversed the fortunes of precolonial regions, but in largely opposite ways.

In this article, nonlinear models of association are combined with linear models for logits of marginal distributions, resulting in models with parameters directly interpretable in terms of association or structural mobility. Goodman's work on combining categories in mobility tables to handle the case where the marginal distributions are also of interest is extended. Extensions to sets of mobility tables are considered next. The article shows finally how to model cross‐national variation in association and structural mobility.

Ding	American Journal of Sociology	112	1	2006-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 97-144	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The authors examine the conditions prompting university‐employed life scientists to become entrepreneurs, defined to occur when a scientist (1) founds a biotechnology company, or (2) joins the scientific advisory board of a new biotechnology firm. This study draws on theories of social influence, socialization, and status dynamics to examine how proximity to colleagues in commercial science influences individuals’ propensity to transition to entrepreneurship. To expose the mechanisms at work, this study also assesses how proximity effects change over time as for‐profit science diffuses through the academy. Using adjusted proportional hazards models to analyze case‐cohort data, the authors find evidence that the orientation toward commercial science of individuals’ colleagues and coauthors, as well as a number of other workplace attributes, significantly influences scientists’ hazards of transitioning to for‐profit science.	
10.1086/426464	10.1086/426464	The Organizational Demography of Racial Employment Segregation	Jesper B. Sørensen	American Journal of Sociology	110	3	2004-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 626-671	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article examines how workers respond to changes in the racial composition of their workplaces. An analysis of the job histories of new hires into multiple work groups within a single firm reveals path dependence in the effects of group composition on turnover. Exit rates are inversely related to the level of same‐race representation at the time of organizational entry and increase when workers experience declines in same‐race representation. However, turnover rates do not decline in response to increases in representation. The results suggest that initial token status can have a lasting impact on attachment and that increases in attachment in integrated groups occur through a cohort‐replacement process. The turnover dynamics also imply that any gains in the representation of minority groups are very fragile. The challenge of workplace racial integration therefore lies not simply in eliminating discrimination in hiring, but also in managing the post‐hire consequences of changes in group composition. Implications of the asymmetric effects of compositional change for the literature on organizational demography are also discussed.

Barnett, Michael Woywode	American Journal of Sociology	109	6	2004-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1452-1499	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article proposes that competition among ideologies can be understood and modeled as an ecology of organizations. It presents a theory of ideological competition among organizations that predicts that competition is strongest among ideologically adjacent organizations—those too different ideologically to enjoy esprit de corps but similar enough to vie for the same base of support. Such competition, the article argues, involves contention over identity, favoring organizations that maintain a distinct ideological position. These ideas are investigated by reference to qualitative and quantitative data from Viennese newspapers over the period 1918 to 1938, a period of considerable social and political change in Vienna. The quantitative evidence is obtained by estimating ecological models of organizational failure and growth. There is also qualitative evidence that actors from various ideological perspectives engaged in strategic framing activity.

Watts	American Journal of Sociology	115	2	2009-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 405-450	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The authors investigate the origins of homophily in a large university community, using network data in which interactions, attributes, and affiliations are all recorded over time. The analysis indicates that highly similar pairs do show greater than average propensity to form new ties; however, it also finds that tie formation is heavily biased by triadic closure and focal closure, which effectively constrain the opportunities among which individuals may select. In the case of triadic closure, moreover, selection to “friend of a friend” status is determined by an analogous combination of individual preference and structural proximity. The authors conclude that the dynamic interplay of choice homophily and induced homophily, compounded over many “generations” of biased selection of similar individuals to structurally proximate positions, can amplify even a modest preference for similar others, via a cumulative advantage–like process, to produce striking patterns of observed homophily.

Using mediated regression, they replicate findings linking education (and not cognitive ability) to AFB. But in a behavior genetic model, both relationships are absorbed within a latent variable measuring the shared family environment. Two interpretations are relevant. First, variance in AFB emerges from differences between families, not differences between sisters within the same family. Second, even in a natural laboratory sensitive to genetic variance in female fertility—during demographic transition—the variance in AFB was nongenetic, located instead within the shared environment.

The antecedents of the field are located in a new economic, institutional, and ideological context. But its foundations are laid by a spectrum of gastronomic writings (journalism, cookbooks, proto‐sociological essays, political philosophy, and literary works) that proposed an expansive, nationalizing culinary discourse. It is this discourse that secured the autonomy of the field, determined its operative features, and was largely responsible for the distinctive position of this cultural field.

Antonio	American Journal of Sociology	106	1	2000-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 40-87	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Revived Weimar‐era “radical conservatism” and fresh “New Right” and “paleoconservative” theories offer a radical cultural critique of global capitalism and liberal democracy. Expressing a broader retribalization and perceived failure of modernization, their defense of communal particularity attacks the multicultural nation‐state, liberal rights, and universal citizenship. This essay links reactionary tribalism to a recurrent 20th‐century theoretical tendency, the “total critique of modernity”—a fusion of oversimplified Nietzschean and Weberian ideas. Historically, total critique has promoted convergence between right and left, such as the current overlapping facets of “radical conservatism” and “strong‐program postmodernism.” Total critique counters the “historicist” method of “internal critique” and the “communication model” characteristic of reflexive social theory. The discussion uncovers the mediating role of social theory in the problematic relationship of science and partially disenchanted public spheres in plural, democratic cultures.

This is not just due to locals holding fast to their traditions but to cosmopolitans becoming knowledgeable about the culture of place as part of their ongoing identity construction. Results from Survey2000, an online survey conducted by the National Geographic Society, show the processes that are maintaining and even increasing the cultural distinctiveness of American regions as indicated by residents' knowledge of local literature. One such process involves what we call cultural “cowbirds,” people new to a region who catch up with the natives’ local cultural knowledge.

In particular, the article explores how this conflict influenced colonial industrialization and land reform, which crucially shaped the path of Korea's transformation. Agrarian conflict theory is shown to greatly enhance the current understanding of Korean (and by extension East Asian) transformation by examining more than just the political economy of development.

Jonsson	American Journal of Sociology	112	6	2007-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1775-1810	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The authors analyze social fluidity among Swedish men and women using a series of 24 annual surveys, 1976–99 (N=63,280). A theoretical model suggests that changes in fluidity are normally driven by cohort rather than period effects. The results support this argument: changes in fluidity between the mid‐1970s and late 1990s were due to the successive replacement of older and less fluid, by younger and more fluid, cohorts. Cohorts differed in their fluidity because the effect of class origins on educational attainment declined (an equalization effect) and because greater shares of each cohort had higher levels of educational attainment, which placed them in labor markets that operate more meritocratically (a compositional effect). The article discusses the relevance of these results for other countries and for policy.

While French food retains high status, gourmet food can now come from a broad range of cuisines. This change mirrors a broadening in other cultural fields labeled “omnivorousness” within the sociology of culture. The authors take gourmet food writing as a case study to understand the rationales underlying omnivorousness. Their findings, based on qualitative and quantitative data, reveal two frames used to valorize a limited number of foods: authenticity and exoticism. These frames resolve a tension between an inclusionary ideology of democratic cultural consumption on the one hand, and an exclusionary ideology of taste and distinction on the other. This article advances our understanding of how cultural consumption sustains status distinctions in the face of eroding boundaries between highbrow and lowbrow culture.

Ridgeway	American Journal of Sociology	115	3	2009-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 832-862	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Why do beliefs that attach different amounts of status to different categories of people become consensually held by the members of a society? We show that two microlevel mechanisms, in combination, imply a system‐level tendency toward consensual status beliefs about a nominal characteristic. (1) Status belief diffusion: a person who has no status belief about a characteristic can acquire a status belief about that characteristic from interacting with one or more people who have that status belief. (2) Status belief loss: a person who has a status belief about a characteristic can lose that belief from interacting with one or more people who have the opposite status belief. These mechanisms imply that opposite status beliefs will tend to be lost at equal rates and will tend to be acquired at rates proportional to their prevalence. Therefore, if a status belief ever becomes more prevalent than its opposite, it will increase in prevalence until every person holds it.

Rendall	American Journal of Sociology	107	5	2002-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1300-1346	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article estimates lifetime inheritances by combining survey self‐reports of inheritances received with forecasts of prospective inheritances. These estimates encompass whites and blacks of the baby boom generation and the two preceding generations. The white‐black gap in lifetime inheritances is found to increase both absolute and relative racial wealth inequality. The gap is estimated to be much larger for the baby boom generation than for previous generations. Combined with the stalling of blacks’ progress in earnings relative to whites’ since the 1980s, the baby boom generation may thus have begun a reversal of progress toward racial economic equality, with inheritances playing a key role in this reversal.

Bargaining and Time in Household Work	Michael Bittman, Paula England, Liana Sayer, Nancy Folbre, George Matheson	American Journal of Sociology	109	1	2003-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 186-214	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Using data from Australia and the United States, the authors explore the effect of spouses’ contribution to family income on how housework is divided. Consistent with exchange‐bargaining theory, women decrease their housework as their earnings increase, up to the point where both spouses contribute equally to income. In other respects, gender trumps money. The base level of housework for women is much higher. Among the small percentage of couples who are in the range where women provide 51%–100% of household income, the change in housework is opposite what exchange theory predicts: couples that deviate from the normative income standard (men make more money than women) seem to compensate with a more traditional division of household work.

Espinosa	American Journal of Sociology	102	4	1997-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 939-999	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Using data gathered in 25 Mexican communities, the authors link individual acts of migration to 41 theoretically defined individual-, household-, community-, and macroeconomic-level predictors. The indicators vary through time to yield a discrete-time event-history analysis. Over the past 25 years, probabilities of first, repeat, and return migration have been linked more to the forces identified by social capital theory and the new economics of migration than to the cost-benefit calculations assumed by the neoclassical model. The authors find that Mexico-U.S. migration stems from three mutually reinforcing processes: social capital formation, human capital formation, and market consolidation.

Instead, drawing on the distinction between the concepts of “class structure” and “class formation,” the main argument of this article is that party practices contribute to the formation of “cleavages” and in the process gain ascendancy and hegemony. A party's practices are, however, relatively autonomous from the underlying structures. Through a comparative case study of the ascendancy and rise to hegemony of the precursor to the Communist Party of India (CPI) in Kerala, India, during the nationalist movement of the 1930s and 1940s, this article traces the specific manner in which the party’s own strategies drew upon prevalent structural possibilities, making class a salient cleavage. The methodology of posing historical counterfactual questions is utilized to measure how much difference particular political practices (and not other possible ones, or underlying structural factors) made to this outcome.

Each of these systems can be characterized by distinct underlying gender “logics” and by the context of state response to issues of gender equality in the labor market. Using census and labor force survey data from 1960 to 1990 for 14 industrialized countries, log‐linear models are employed to evaluate how levels and patterns of occupational sex segregation have evolved over this time period. Analyses reveal that cross‐national variation in both the levels and patterns of segregation is declining over time; but at the same time, the remaining diversity among countries is increasingly patterned according to one of four segregation regimes. It appears that wholly idiosyncratic cross‐national differences in the contours of occupational sex segregation are withering away as countries come to settle on, with ever‐fewer exceptions, one of four possible segregation regimes.

Current social research often theorizes culture as “collective representations”—vocabularies, symbols, or codes—that structure people’s abilities to think and act. Missing is an account of how groups use collective representations in everyday interaction. The authors use two ethnographic cases to develop a concept of “group style,” showing how implicit, culturally patterned styles of membership filter collective representations. The result is “culture in interaction,” which complements research in the sociology of emotion, neoinstitutionalism, the reproduction of inequality, and other work, by showing how groups put culture to use in everyday life.

Carr	American Journal of Sociology	108	6	2003-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1249-1291	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article presents a five‐year ethnographic study of informal social control in the Chicago neighborhood “Beltway,” where controls at the private and what has traditionally been known as the parochial level are weaker and less important than heretofore assumed. In addition, the parochial and the public arenas are inseparable from each other, not independent as others have argued. Instead, informal social control in Beltway is characterized by what the author calls the “new parochialism,” where diminished private and traditionally parochial forms of social control are replaced by a combination of parochial and public controls. The new parochialism is occasioned by wider societal and local changes, and the concept is shown to have theoretical and empirical implications.

Kubrin	American Journal of Sociology	112	6	2007-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1848-1885	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This study examines the structural correlates of Hispanic suicide at the metropolitan level using Mortality Multiple Cause‐of‐Death Records and 2000 census data. The authors test competing hypotheses regarding the effects of immigration, assimilation, affluence, economic disadvantage, and ethnic inequality on suicide levels for Hispanics as a whole and disaggregated by immigrant status. The findings point to multiple forces and complex relationships among social structure, culture, and Hispanic suicide. The findings also suggest that these factors have unique effects on native‐born versus immigrant populations. This is the first study to determine the structural correlates of suicide among Hispanics and to assess the macrolevel influence of immigration and cultural assimilation on ethnic‐specific suicide.

Event history analyses show that cities with progressive profiles were markedly quicker to pass such resolutions. These effects are strongest in the early phase of the Bill of Rights campaign, a period for which there is also robust evidence of contagious influence among nearby cities. The authors argue that the campaign’s success lies in the miscibility of multiple movements—the ability of groups with different beliefs, agendas, and traditions to combine around a common goal. The case is used to distinguish between strong and weak forms of miscibility and to develop insight into strategic, organizational, and political conditions that promote the construction of movement‐spanning coalitions.

Such an interpretation is contravened by evidence that both happiness and the environment are influenced by genetic factors and family upbringing. Using the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States, which includes a subsample of twins, this study evaluates the relationship between happiness and various features of success before and after eliminating the influence of endowments. The results suggest that many putative indicators of the environment are highly heritable and, indeed, that the same genes that affect the environment may affect happiness as well. Yet the results also suggest that the role of genetic endowments varies considerably across different features of success, suggesting complex patterns of selection, reinforcement, and causation among genes and the environment.

McFarland	American Journal of Sociology	109	6	2004-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1249-1318	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Resistance is a change‐oriented process that follows certain stereotyped sequences of behaviors. These sequences are promulgated by intentional actors who cue cultural forms (rituals) in order to guide interaction. This process can be understood as a social drama composed of four stages: breach, crisis, redress, and reintegration. Using interviews and ethnographic accounts of behaviors in 165 classrooms at two high schools, this article describes the nature of each stage and the strategies used by both protagonists and antagonists of change. Since social dramas are disruptive episodes of social action, special attention is paid to the potential they have for transforming the social order, thereby affecting micro‐ to macrolevel change.

Bailey	American Journal of Sociology	108	2	2002-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 406-439	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Researchers hold that the racial democracy ideology fosters a rejection of discrimination‐based explanations for racial inequality, thereby affecting antiracist mobilization. This study finds that Brazilians understand the discriminatory basis of inequality and that an attitudinal dimension associated with racial democracy strongly increases the likelihood of that understanding. Negative stereotyping produces a smaller opposite effect, and “race” is not a significant predictor. Finally, Brazilian and American racial attitudes differ considerably in explaining black disadvantage. These findings question perceptions of Brazilian racial attitudes and the efficacy of dominant theories for their analysis, suggesting a context‐driven approach to theorizing and for antidiscrimination strategizing.

Sampson	American Journal of Sociology	114	1	2008-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 189-231	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The Moving to Opportunity (MTO) housing experiment has proven to be an important intervention not just in the lives of the poor, but in social science theories of neighborhood effects. Competing causal claims have been the subject of considerable disagreement, culminating in the debate between Clampet‐Lundquist and Massey and Ludwig et al. in this issue. This article assesses the debate by clarifying analytically distinct questions posed by neighborhood‐level theories, reconceptualizing selection bias as a fundamental social process worthy of study in its own right rather than a statistical nuisance, and reconsidering the scientific method of experimentation, and hence causality, in the social world of the city. The author also analyzes MTO and independent survey data from Chicago to examine trajectories of residential attainment. Although MTO provides crucial leverage for estimating neighborhood effects on individuals, as proponents rightly claim, this study demonstrates the implications imposed by a stratified urban structure and how MTO simultaneously provides a new window on the social reproduction of concentrated inequality.

Of 382 public events in police records for one year in a small U.S. city, 45% convey a message, 14% involve social conflict, and 13% are standard protest event forms. Local newspapers covered 32% of all events, favoring events that were large, involved conflict, were sponsored by business groups, and occurred in central locations. The more liberal paper also favored rallies and events sponsored by national social movement organizations (SMOs) or recreational groups. Discussion centers on the ways these factors shape the content of the public sphere.

These phenomena are characterized by a power‐law distribution of event sizes. This kind of analysis is applied to outbreaks of class conflict in Chicago from 1881 to 1886. Events are defined as individual strikes or miniature strike waves; size is measured by the number of establishments or workers involved. In each case, events follow a power law spanning two or three orders of magnitude. A similar pattern is found for strikes in Paris from 1890 to 1899. The “forest fire” model serves to illustrate the kind of process that can generate this distribution.

Using quadratic assignment procedure (QAP) regression, the author shows that social ties formed through common membership on corporate boards contribute more to similarity of political behavior than commonalities of economic interests, such as those associated with operating in the same industry or the same geographic region. Moreover, the politically cohesive effects of directorship ties remain robust even as one moves several links down the chain of indirect ties that connect top corporate officers to one another. The study thus provides empirical support for the thesis that social networks among corporate elites facilitate political cohesion within the business community.

These networks, however, do not typically emerge as linear responses to individual‐level changes; rather, subtle changes in relations produce extraordinarily different macrolevel outcomes. Similarly, nuances in how we conceptualize, define, and measure relations can lead to widely different network characterizations. The author demonstrates this variability using a spectrum of interaction types and argue that the dependence of results on subtleties in definition or measurement makes theoretical interpretation difficult. He offers an index to calculate how much inaccuracy or imprecision relational definitions or data‐gathering techniques can tolerate before results yield utterly different interpretations.

Conflicting Narratives of Collective Selfhood in Stigmatized Groups	Dawne Moon	American Journal of Sociology	117	5	2012-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1336-1379	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Identity politics arises out of conditions of systematic stigmatization and structural disadvantage, but sharing a social structural position does not guarantee that people will define themselves and their collectivity in the same way. In fact, because identity politics occupies two major points of tension, it gives rise to several alternative ways of conceptualizing the “we,” the collective self. Using ethnographic material gathered on American Jews’ understandings of anti-Semitism and its relationship to contemporary politics, this article inductively discerns four alternative models of collective selfhood (embattled, relating, political, and redeemed) that correspond to four alternative narratives of identity politics (reified identity, humanistic dialogue, critical solidarity, and evangelism). These narratives help explain the deep emotions sparked by challenges to people’s self-definitions. A comparison to studies of LGBT movements further reveals the utility of this conceptualization and elaborates a model not apparent in the first case.

Lucas	American Journal of Sociology	106	6	2001-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1642-1690	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article proposes a general explanation for social background‐related inequality. Educational attainment research indicates that the later an education transition, the lower the social background effect. While some suggest life course changes in the parent‐child relationship or between‐family competition explain this pattern, others contend the result is a statistical artifact, and that the analytic strategy presupposes agents are irrationally myopic. This article addresses these criticisms by framing educational transitions in terms of students' movement through the stratified curriculum. Students select their stratum, one of which is dropping out. To make these choices, they consider their most recent salient performance. Using time‐varying performance measures to predict students' track placement/school continuation sustains the validity of the educational transitions approach and suggests substantively important social background effects even for nearly universal transitions. Results are consistent with the general perspective termed effectively maintained inequality.

Fernandez, M. Lourdes Sosa	American Journal of Sociology	111	3	2005-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 859-904	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Understanding the mechanisms driving gender segregation has become a key focus in research on gender and labor markets. While the literature often invokes gender‐sorting mechanisms that operate prehire, the data used to study these processes are usually collected on posthire populations. This article examines the workings of prehire mechanisms determining job sex segregation. Analyzing unique data on the recruitment and hiring process for customer service representatives at a telephone service center, all of the factors examined—preapplication choices, gender homophilous networks, and screeners’ choices—play significant roles in the gender segregation of this job. The analyses also show that making inferences about prehire processes on the basis of posthire data can be misleading. The authors conclude by discussing the theoretical and methodological implications of these findings.

Since the 1990s, this market, in which investors buy strangers’ life insurance policies, has grown in the face of considerable moral ambivalence. The author uses news reports and interviews to identify and describe three conceptions of this market: sacred revulsion, consumerist consolation, and rationalized reconciliation. Differences among the conceptions are considered in view of the institutional legacy of life insurance and its success in organizing practices, perceptions, and understandings about markets and death. From this case, the author draws implications for analyses of morals in markets, an important and emergent topic within economic sociology.

Yabiku	American Journal of Sociology	106	5	2001-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1219-1261	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The social organization of the family is a key link between macrolevel social change and individual‐level childbearing behavior. The family mode of organization framework and life course perspective are used to develop hypotheses about these links. To test those hypotheses, the analysis uses a combination of life history and neighborhood history measures designed explicitly for this purpose. Results from fully dynamic multilevel hazard models demonstrate both childhood and adult community contexts shape childbearing in independent ways. The results implicate a variety of specific mechanisms linking social change to fertility behavior: cost‐benefit analysis, ideational diffusion, and long‐term personality development. The results also show contextual characteristics at multiple points in the life course may each exert independent effects on individual outcomes.

It begins by showing how the strengths and weaknesses of methods commonly used to compare institutions or regions reappear in comparisons between times. The discussion then turns to alternative approaches. The use of narrative and of path dependency to construct explanatory sequences are strategies that strike a welcome balance between causal generalization and historical detail. But these approaches typically fail to identify either the causal mechanisms or the trajectories that link events in different eras. These gaps can be filled by rethinking sequences of events across periods as reiterated problem solving. Successive U.S. industrial relations regimes since 1900 are used to illustrate this methodological strategy.

Focusing on law and economics, the authors first show that the weak field of EU studies serves as a crossroads between nationally anchored scholarly professions and Europe’s political field; second, they show that under certain conditions legal and economic constructions have exerted performative effects via scholarly avatars. Depending on their strategic positioning, scholarly avatars facilitate symbolic exchange across political, technocratic, and scholarly boundaries and endow theoretical constructions with performative potential.

We combine arguments about organizational cognition and institutional mimicry to develop a model of adaptive emulation, where firms respond to perceived failure by imitating their most successful peers. Computational experiments show that this process generates empirically plausible cascades of adoption, even if innovations are entirely worthless. Faddish cycles are most robust across alternative treatments of managerial decision making where innovations have modest positive effects on outcomes. These results have broad implications for the faddishness of a business community increasingly marked by media‐driven accounts of success, and for the properties of organizational practices that are hot one day and cold the next.

The authors test whether this “strength of weak ties” generalizes from simple to complex contagions. Complex contagions require social affirmation from multiple sources. Examples include the spread of high‐risk social movements, avant garde fashions, and unproven technologies. Results show that as adoption thresholds increase, long ties can impede diffusion. Complex contagions depend primarily on the width of the bridges across a network, not just their length. Wide bridges are a characteristic feature of many spatial networks, which may account in part for the widely observed tendency for social movements to diffuse spatially.

Bechky	American Journal of Sociology	109	3	2003-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 720-752	The University of Chicago Press	fla		While the development and control of professional jurisdictions has been well studied, less is known about the way in which occupational jurisdictions are enacted within organizations. This article suggests that one can gain insight about such dynamics through analyzing occupational communities’ use of organizational artifacts. This article describes the ways in which two artifacts—engineering drawings and machines—mediate the relations of engineers, technicians, and assemblers in a manufacturing firm. These artifacts are useful in problem solving across boundaries. At the same time, authority over these objects can reinforce or redistribute task area boundaries, and by symbolizing the work of occupational groups, the objects also represent and strengthen beliefs about the legitimacy of a group’s work.

Engen, Sara Steen	American Journal of Sociology	105	5	2000-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1357-1395	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article addresses whether and how organizational processes and the exercise of discretion affect the relationship between sentencing reforms and sentencing outcomes. Organizational perspectives are drawn upon to develop competing hypotheses regarding courts' adaptations to and implementation of reforms under sentencing guidelines. To test these hypotheses, changes in the charging and sentencing of drug offenders in Washington State from 1986 to 1995 are examined following a series of sentencing reforms. The findings suggest that changes to the sentencing laws have resulted in adaptations by courtroom workgroups that are consistent with an organizational efficiency model of criminal justice.

Fettes	American Journal of Sociology	113	3	2007-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 653-701	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The authors draw on developmental psychopathology, life course sociology, and scholarship on educational processes to develop a conceptual framework for understanding the association of children’s mental health problems with educational attainment. They use this framework to address two empirical gaps in prior research: lack of attention to mental health trajectories and the failure to consider diverse explanations. Using data from the Children of the National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth data set, the authors identify latent classes that characterize trajectories of internalizing and externalizing problems from childhood through adolescence. Youths in the classes vary significantly in their likelihoods of high school completion and college entry. The authors evaluate the ability of three sets of mediators to explain these patterns: academic aptitude, disruptive behaviors, and educational expectations. Educational expectations are important mediators independent of academic aptitude and disruptive behaviors. Social responses to youths' mental health problems contribute importantly to their disrupted educational trajectories.

Abrego	American Journal of Sociology	117	5	2012-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1380-1421	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article analyzes how Central American immigrants in tenuous legal statuses experience current immigration laws. Based on ethnographic observations and over 200 interviews conducted between 1998 and 2009 with immigrants in Los Angeles and Phoenix and individuals in sending communities, this study reveals how the convergence and implementation of immigration and criminal law constitute forms of violence. Drawing on theories of structural and symbolic violence, the authors use the analytic category “legal violence” to capture the normalized but cumulatively injurious effects of the law. The analysis focuses on three central and interrelated areas of immigrants’ lives—work, family, and schooling—to expose how the criminalization of immigrants at the federal, state, and local levels is not only exclusionary but also generates violent effects for individual immigrants and their families, affecting everyday lives and long-term incorporation processes.

The author first provides evidence that the French pattern is not caused by adherence to cultural traditions of egalitarianism. The author then uses historical and interview data to compare the French case with the American counterexample. The argument is that France has adopted a “pragmatic neoliberalism” because in the postwar period it had adopted a “pragmatic state interventionism” designed not to further goals of social justice, but to turn an agricultural country into an industrial one. Moreover, neoliberalism in the United States required a remarkable degree of extreme political innovation which has not been possible in France.

The authors apply this model to racial earnings inequality, focusing on how exposure to discrimination influences both human capital acquisition and earnings inequalities as they develop across the career. The authors estimate models of career earnings trajectories, which show flatter trajectories for black and Hispanic men relative to white men, partial mediation by human capital acquired inside the labor market, and much larger race/ethnic career inequalities among the highly educated.

Roscigno	American Journal of Sociology	108	6	2003-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1292-1327	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Individual participation has been at the core of much theorizing and research on social movements. Little of this attention, however, has focused on the labor movement and individual strike involvement. In this article, the authors extend the literature by employing rational choice and network perspectives on social movement participation and by analyzing strike mobilization in a recent action by the Communication Workers of America. The data are unique to social movement analyses as they include participants as well as nonparticipants, have significant heterogeneity across lines of status, and provide potentially influential individual background and network indicators. Findings show how race, income, and occupational distinctions are influential for strike behavior. Importantly, workers' networks at the point of production also impact strike involvement. The authors discuss the implications of these and related results for understanding worker insurgency and social movement participation more generally.

Drawing from cumulative inequality theory, the authors analyze trajectories of life evaluations and then consider whether early adversity offsets favorable expectations for the future. Results reveal that early adversity contributes to more negative views of the past but rising expectations for the future. Early adversity also has enduring effects on life evaluations, offsetting the influence of buoyant expectations. The findings draw attention to the limits of human agency under the constraints of early adversity—a process described as biographical structuration.

To guide this empirical study, a conceptual model is developed that emphasizes the coevolution of politics and markets to synthesize theoretical ideas in the recent debate on the transformation of state socialist societies. The findings show significant changes in returns to education and in the rise of private/hybrid firms in the reform era. There is also strong evidence of institutional persistence in returns to positional power and in the organizational hierarchy. These findings reveal multifaceted processes of transformation that call for more sophisticated theoretical models and in-depth institutional analyses.

Cohen	American Journal of Sociology	109	4	2004-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 902-936	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Despite decades of research showing greater black‐white inequality in local areas where the black population is relatively large, little is known about the mechanisms for this effect. Using a unique data set of individuals nested within jobs across labor markets, this article tests two possible mechanisms for the black concentration effect on wage inequality: job segregation and devaluation. Results show that black population size is associated with greater segregation of black workers into black‐dominated jobs. On the other hand, no evidence is found that the penalty for working in a black‐dominated job (the devaluation effect) increases as a function of black population size. The article concludes that discrimination against workers—especially exclusion from better‐paying jobs—is an important mechanism for the effect of black population size on the racial wage gap.

Quantitative and qualitative content analyses of the professional management literature (mid‐1980s–mid‐1990s) illustrate a managerialization of law, a process by which legal ideas are refigured by managerial ways of thinking as they flow across the boundaries of legal fields and into managerial and organizational fields. The managerial conception of diversity adds a variety of nonlegal dimensions of diversity (e.g., personality traits) to the legally protected categories like race and sex, and it disassociates diversity from civil rights law.

Through the use of protest event, archival, and secondary sources on El Salvador between 1962 and 1981, the study examines the outbreak and forms of two protest waves that are generated by the temporal sequencing of political opportunity and threat environments. The specific opportunities of institutional access and competitive elections motivate regime challengers to form durable civic organizations. This newly available organizational infrastructure can be used to sustain reformist contention in the near term as well as be radicalized to launch more disruptive and violent protest campaigns when opportunities recede and the political environment transitions to one characterized by mounting threats (state‐attributed economic problems, erosion of rights, and state repression).

Availability of external resources, state organizational capacity, and alliances with social actors are shown to help determine the political response to armed conflict. Overall, the article emphasizes the importance of causal sequence in determining the effect of war. War did not make states in Latin America because it occurred under very different historical circumstances than during the European “military revolution.” Without the prior establishment of political authority and without a link between such an organization and social actors, war will not contribute to institutional development.

This article (1) further describes the IE algebraically, geometrically, and verbally, (2) reviews properties of the IE as a statistical estimator, (3) provides model validation evidence for the IE both from an empirical example and from a simulation exercise, (4) relates the coefficients of the IE to those of conventional constrained APC models using formal definitions of statistical estimability, hypothesis testing, and empirical applications that directly address a criticism that often has been lodged at general‐purpose methods of APC analysis, and (5) introduces computer software for application of the IE that interested users can readily access. The authors conclude that the IE holds the potential for applications not only to APC analysis but also to similar problems of structural underidentification in sociology.

The essay returns repeatedly to the paradox of timelessness, that is, the recurrence of similar forms of political humor, indeed identical jokes, in different centuries and among different peoples.

Snedker	American Journal of Sociology	117	3	2011-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 844-887	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This project employs a moral solidarity framework to explore the relationship between organized religion and lynching in the American South. The authors ask whether a county’s religious composition affected its rate of lynching, net of demographic and economic controls. The authors find evidence for the solidarity thesis, using three religious metrics. First, their findings show that counties with greater religious diversity experienced more lynching, supporting the notion that a pluralistic religious marketplace with competing religious denominations weakened the bonds of a cohesive moral community and might have enhanced white racial solidarity. Second, counties in which a larger share of the black population worshipped in churches controlled by blacks experienced higher levels of racial violence, indicating a threat to intergroup racially based solidarity. Finally, the authors find a lower incidence of lynching in counties where a larger share of church members belonged to racially mixed denominations, suggesting that cross-racial solidarity served to reduce racial violence.

Hypotheses regarding how occupational sex and race composition affect these career outcomes are tested with data describing work histories of California state government employees. Although female‐ and minority‐dominated occupations were disadvantaged in many respects, their incumbents moved among state agencies more frequently (and reaped greater economic benefit) than did employees in occupations dominated by white males. Intraorganizational promotions yielded roughly comparable salary gains for incumbents of male‐ and female‐dominated occupations, but through distinct paths: male‐dominated occupations had less frequent promotions with larger salary increases; female‐dominated occupations experienced more frequent job shifts with smaller pay changes.  Men in female‐dominated occupations were shielded from many of the adverse career outcomes experienced by their female counterparts.

Using a unique measure—the earnings gap between black and white workers resulting from sorting into different occupations within an occupationally and educationally delimited labor queue—the author tests hypotheses from the combined model. Results show support for the combined model, as characteristics of labor and job queues significantly influence the extent of black‐white inequality. Variables representing employers’ preferences for or against hiring black workers are also significant, suggesting the utility of jointly examining preferences and processes in the labor market.

Pairs of fictitious résumés were sent in response to 1,769 job postings in seven states. One résumé in each pair was randomly assigned experience in a gay campus organization, and the other résumé was assigned a control organization. Two main findings have emerged. First, in some but not all states, there was significant discrimination against the fictitious applicants who appeared to be gay. This geographic variation in the level of discrimination appears to reflect regional differences in attitudes and antidiscrimination laws. Second, employers who emphasized the importance of stereotypically male heterosexual traits were particularly likely to discriminate against openly gay men. Beyond these particular findings, this study advances the audit literature more generally by covering multiple regions and by highlighting how audit techniques may be used to identify stereotypes that affect employment decisions in real labor markets.

To interpret these patterns, which are global in scope but microsocial in character, this article uses the term “global microstructures.” Features of the interaction order, loosely defined, have become constitutive of and implanted in processes that have global breadth. This study draws on Schutz in the development of the concept of temporal coordination as the basis for the level of intersubjectivity discerned in global markets. This article contributes to economic sociology through the analysis of cambist (i.e., trading) markets, which are distinguished from producer markets, and by positing a form of market coordination that supplements relational or network forms of coordination.

David Jacobs, Katherine Wood	American Journal of Sociology	105	1	1999-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 157-190	The University of Chicago Press	fla		What factors lead to interracial killings? Because racial conflict explanations have been overlooked in the previous literature, this article studies the determinants of disaggregated interracial killing rates in 165 U.S. cities by testing economic, political, and social control accounts. After holding the probability of interracial contacts and the total murder rate constant, the results show that cities with a black mayor and greater economic competition between the races have more white killings of blacks. The same hypotheses explain black killings of whites, but these killings are less likely in cities with black mayors. Police department size does not explain white killings of blacks, but cities with larger departments have fewer black killings of whites. The findings suggest that economic rivalries and contests for political influence lead to greater interracial violence.

Thompson's classic contribution to organization theory, Organizations in Action. The reconstruction explicates the underlying argumentation structure for Thompson's propositions‐‐literally, theorems or problems to be demonstrated. This allows Thompson's propositions to be derived as theorems in a deductive theory. As it turns out, the formal theory is based on general assumptions using only few primitive concepts. In addition, this theory explains why Thompson's propositions do not hold for noncomplex or “atomic” organizations (a restriction on the domain of application). Furthermore, this study reveals that organizations attempt to reduce constraints in their en‐vironment‐‐a heretofore unknown implication of the theory.

Brinton	American Journal of Sociology	114	4	2009-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 977-1036	The University of Chicago Press	fla		In the sociological literature on social mobility, the long‐standing convention has been to assume that intergenerational reproduction takes one of two forms: a categorical form that has parents passing on a big‐class position to their children or a gradational form that has parents passing on their socioeconomic standing. These approaches ignore in their own ways the important role that occupations play in transferring opportunities from one generation to the next. In new analyses of nationally representative data from the United States, Sweden, Germany, and Japan, the authors show that (a) occupations are an important conduit for social reproduction, (b) the most extreme rigidities in the mobility regime are only revealed when analyses are carried out at the occupational level, and (c) much of what shows up as big‐class reproduction in conventional mobility analyses is in fact occupational reproduction in disguise.

Leicht, Heather Wendt	American Journal of Sociology	111	4	2006-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1122-1180	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The United States has experienced a major devolution of social and economic policy responsibilities to the states. Subnational industrial policies to create jobs and qualitative economic growth are key to this devolution. The authors examine the development of these policies in terms of (1) the articulation of class interests, (2) state‐level political institutions, (3) prior political legacies, (4) underlying production regimes, and (5) interactions of strong political institutions and class mobilization. An annual pooled cross‐sectional time‐series analysis of three state‐level economic development policies (entrepreneurial, industrial recruitment, and labor market regulation) shows that in addition to business power and strong state capacities, the political legacies of 1930s welfare policy innovations and mezocorporatist bargaining potential condition the effects of business power.

Comparing the 1989 movement to the May 4th movement of 1919 and to the December 9th movement of 1935–36, this study finds the rhetoric and activity patterns of the 1989 movement to be actually more traditional than those of its forerunners. This is quite a paradox, considering the scale of social change in China during the 20th century. This article argues that the 1989 movement's traditionalist outlook can be explained by three structural conditions, all involving state‐society relations. In comparison with the states of the earlier movements, the state during the 1980s had a higher capacity for repression. To avoid immediate repression, students tended to hide their real demands and goals behind safer and culturally congenial forms of action. Second, China in the 1980s had comparatively weaker independent civil organizations. Hence, the movement was poorly organized, and competing activities frequently occurred in the same time and location. What determined the efficacy of these activities then were less the actors' intentions than the perception of those who were observing the movement. This study argues that people's acceptance of particular movement activities is shaped by their perception of state legitimation. During the 1980s, most Chinese saw that the state's legitimacy lay in its moral performance, close to what was in traditional China. Therefore, people were more receptive to culturally and morally charged movement activities. This furthered the domination of traditionalism during the 1989 movement.

So far, however, they have rarely relied on formal modeling. The author argues that recent advances in computational modeling offer tools to explore the emergence of social forms in the Simmelian tradition. Thanks to common foundations in both epistemology and ontology, these two fields can benefit from drawing more explicitly on each other. The process‐theoretic tradition in social theory and contemporary agent‐based models shift theorizing from nomothetic to generative explanations of social forms, and from variable‐based to configurative ontologies. In order to formalize sociational theory, the author focuses on how to model dynamic social networks and emergent actor configurations.

No such transition occurred, however. Previous explanations for this are inadequate, because they discount the strength of the Tuscany economy or downplay the presence of these preconditions. To explain the Tuscan outcome, this article draws on sectoral theories (agriculture vs. manufacturing) from the neoclassical and Marxist literature. Since these theories often give the wrong prediction, because they are based on formal attributes of actors, the author combines them with a Weberian conceptualization of substantively specific economic interests.

To isolate the effects of time‐varying factors such as legal earnings, drug use, and criminal opportunities, we use data from the National Supported Work Demonstration Project to estimate fixed‐effects models predicting month‐to‐month changes in illegal earnings. We find that criminal earnings are sensitive to embeddedness in conforming work and family relationships, criminal experience, and the perceived risks and rewards of crime. Moreover, heroin and cocaine use creates a strong earnings imperative that is difficult to satisfy in the low‐wage labor market, and offenders earn far more money illegally when they are using these drugs than during periods of abstinence.

Rational‐actor and norm‐based models, diverse holisms and structuralisms, and statistical "variable" analyses continue implicitly or explicitly to prefer the former point of view. By contrast, this "manifesto" presents an alternative, "relational" perspective, first in broad, philosophical outlines, then by exploring its implications for both theory and empirical research. In the closing pages, it ponders some of the difficulties and challenges now facing relational analysis, taking up in turn the issues of boundaries and entities, network dynamics, causality, and normative implications.

Cech	American Journal of Sociology	119	3	2013-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 747-789	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Recent gender scholarship speculates that occupational sex segregation is reproduced in large part through the gendered, self-expressive career decisions of men and women. This article examines the effects of college students’ expression of their self-conceptions on their likelihood of entering occupations with a high or low proportion of women and theorizes the consequences of this mechanism for gender inequality. The author uses unique longitudinal data on students from four U.S. colleges to examine how the gender composition of students’ field at career launch is influenced by their earlier self-conceptions. Students with emotional, unsystematic, or people-oriented self-conceptions enter fields that are more “female,” even net of their cultural gender beliefs. Results suggest that cultural ideals of self-expression reinforce occupational sex segregation by converting gender-stereotypical self-conceptions into self-expressive career choices. The discussion section broadens this theoretical framework for understanding the role of self-expression in occupational sex segregation and notes the difficulty of addressing this mechanism through social or policy actions.

Cultural Entrepreneurship in the Founding of the Paris Opera	Victoria Johnson	American Journal of Sociology	113	1	2007-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 97-127	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Organization theorists have long recognized that organizations take on elements from their environments in the course of being founded. This observation, articulated by Stinchcombe in 1965 and known today as the “organizational imprinting hypothesis,” is frequently cited but remains little understood. Advances in cultural sociology and entrepreneurship studies have provided tools for unpacking this process. The author draws on these tools to underscore the role played by entrepreneurs in selecting and incorporating historically specific elements that may remain for decades or even centuries as fundamental features of the organization in question. The founding of the Paris Opera under Louis XIV serves as the basis for theorizing organizational imprinting at founding as an outcome of cultural entrepreneurship.

Economics was crucial to the creation of financial derivatives exchanges: it helped remedy the drastic loss of legitimacy suffered by derivatives in the first half of the 20th century. Option pricing theory—a “crown jewel” of neoclassical economics—succeeded empirically not because it discovered preexisting price patterns but because markets changed in ways that made its assumptions more accurate and because the theory was used in arbitrage. The performativity of economics, however, has limits, and an emphasis on it needs to be combined with classic themes in economic sociology, such as Granovetterian embedding and the way in which exchanges can be cultures and moral communities in which collective action problems can be solved.

Tying together political sociology's concept of policy feedback with legal and cultural sociology's concept of culture as a resource, the article explains how actors who were hampered by the explicit language used to embed equal opportunity values into law turned apparent constraint into an opportunity to transform law. The article simultaneously illuminates an underdeveloped aspect of equal employment law's unfolding and builds more general theory to help explain how law's language, general cultural values expressed in law, and alternative methods used to interpret law mediate the effects of past law on future law. Defining concepts of value centrality and explicitness of legal language, the article uses its case study to suggest hypotheses about how variation in centrality of cultural values and explicitness of language used to incorporate these values into law affect variation in mobilization of different types of cultural strategies by actors struggling over law interpretation and enforcement.

Sutton	American Journal of Sociology	106	2	2000-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 350-386	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Rates of imprisonment have risen in many Western democracies over the past few decades, most dramatically in the United States. The development of a systematic and general explanation of imprisonment trends has been impeded because of the theoretical and methodological limitations of prior quantitative studies. Most use data from a single country or jurisdiction and focus narrowly on the Rusche‐Kirchheimer “labor surplus” hypothesis, with little attention to alternative explanations. This study takes a cross‐national perspective, using longitudinal data from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States to offer an institutional account of imprisonment rates. The labor surplus effect is treated as a special case of a more general process by which individuals are allocated among alternative life‐course paths. This allocation process is likely to be influenced by macrolevel institutional arrangements and contests for political power. Hypotheses are tested using pooled time‐series cross‐section regression techniques. Results support this broadened perspective: prison growth is driven not only by crime rates and unemployment rates, but also by welfare spending and the power of right parties.

This study analyzes national and state‐level court data to assess their imposition and interview data to identify their social and legal consequences. Findings indicate that monetary sanctions are imposed on a substantial majority of the millions of people convicted of crimes in the United States annually and that legal debt is substantial relative to expected earnings. This indebtedness reproduces disadvantage by reducing family income, by limiting access to opportunities and resources, and by increasing the likelihood of ongoing criminal justice involvement.

These perspectives are used to explain the disappearance of the Southern plantation in the decades following the American Civil War. Findings suggest that there is limited support for exogenous explanations of plantation demise, emphasizing damage from the Civil War and population pressures. Ecological dynamics, especially challenges from alternative forms of labor organization and interdependencies with mid‐size farms, play a greater role. Another crucial influence involves the decisions made by laborers in the plantation system with respect to incentive structures and the reconstruction of their social networks. These findings lead to a perspective on organizational forms that brings lower‐level members back in as agents of grass‐roots change and contestation.

The author provides an alternative interpretation: hybrids can maintain a distinctive boundary and can emerge from contestation, not coexistence. This alternative interpretation is grounded in an analysis of a critical moment at the academic‐commercial boundary: the enforcement of patents to a key technology on academic geneticists. In their reaction to commercial encroachment, skilled actors (scientists) took the resources of the commercial logic and transformed their meaning to establish hybrid strategies that preserved the distinctive institutions. Thus, hybrids must be reconsidered as emerging from conflict and produced through boundary work to maintain the distinction and resilience of logics.

Seidel	American Journal of Sociology	106	3	2000-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 763-816	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This study focuses on the impact of sex, race, and social networks, to analyze the hiring process in a midsized high‐technology organization, using information on all 35,229 applicants in a 10‐year period (1985–94). For gender, the process is entirely meritocratic: age and education account for all sex differences. But even without taking into account the two meritocratic variables, there are small if no differences between men and women at all stages in the hiring process. For ethnic minorities, the process is partly meritocratic but partly reliant upon social networks. Once referral method is taken into account, all race effects disappear. In hiring, ethnic minorities are thus disadvantaged in the processes that take place before the organization is contacted. They lack access to or utilize less well the social networks that lead to high success in getting hired.

It suggests that media attention to radical right violence and public reactions to violence affect the clustering of targets and the temporal and spatial distribution of violence. The notion of “discursive opportunities” is introduced, and the article argues that it can serve to link political opportunity structure and framing perspectives on collective action. Using a cross‐sectional and time‐series design to model event counts in states in Germany, this study finds that differential public visibility, resonance, and legitimacy of right‐wing violence significantly affected the rate of violence against different target groups.

Elder, Jr.	American Journal of Sociology	112	6	2007-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1886-1924	The University of Chicago Press	fla		While there is consistent evidence that inequality in economic resources follows a process of cumulative advantage, the application of this framework to another aspect of life course inequality, health, has not produced consensus. This analysis uses longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to examine the over‐time relationship between health and socioeconomic status, considering how multiple dimensions of socioeconomic resources and economic history are related to health disparities as people age. The authors find cautious support for path‐ and duration‐dependent processes of cumulative advantage in health. Results suggest that in studies of mechanisms of inequality over time, the cumulative advantage process may appear to be bounded by age because of the disproportionate attrition and mortality of those with low socioeconomic status.

Moore	American Journal of Sociology	106	1	2000-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1-39	The University of Chicago Press	fla		A case study of black college students at a predominantly white liberal arts college is employed to question continuing assumptions in sociological research that blacks represent social, cultural, and economic homogeneity and that intraracial relations are close and without conflict. The article examines the extent to which black students feel close to other black students on campus, rely on one another for need satisfaction and social interaction, and share similar values, experiences, and attitudes. The authors find that the odds of closeness are significantly reduced for biracial students, for black students from low SES backgrounds, and for black students from predominantly white backgrounds. Among biracial students and those from predominantly white environments, social distance reflects their overall distance from the larger black community and is a function of their lack of “racial awareness.” The social distance of low SES students appears specific to the community of black students within the college and is not expressed toward the larger black community. Moreover, feelings of distance appear to be driven by perceived social, cultural, and economic differences from other black students.

Although past studies have used various methods to separate preference from opportunity, researchers have not yet systematically compared the properties and implications of these methods. This study puts forward a general framework for discrete choice, where choice probability is specified as proportional to the product of preference and opportunity. To implement this framework, the authors propose a modification to the conditional logit model for estimating preference parameters free from the influence of opportunity structure and then compare this approach to several alternative methods for separating preference and opportunity used in the friendship choice literature. As an empirical example, the authors test hypotheses of homophily and status asymmetry in friendship choice using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. The example also demonstrates the approach of conducting a sensitivity analysis to examine how parameter estimates vary by specification of the opportunity structure.

They propose an explanation that highlights a “paradox of empty promises.” Their core arguments are that the global institutionalization of human rights has created an international context in which (1) governments often ratify human rights treaties as a matter of window dressing, radically decoupling policy from practice and at times exacerbating negative human rights practices, but (2) the emergent global legitimacy of human rights exerts independent global civil society effects that improve states’ actual human rights practices. The authors’ statistical analyses on a comprehensive sample of government repression from 1976 to 1999 find support for their argument.

Alderson, François Nielsen	American Journal of Sociology	107	5	2002-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1244-1299	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The debate on the resurgence of income inequality in some advanced industrial                     societies has often focused on the impact of an increasingly integrated world                     economy, typified by growing capital mobility, heightened international                     competition, and an increase in migration. This study represents one of the                     first systematic, cross‐national examinations of the role of                     globalization in the inequality “U-turn.” Results                     indicate, on the one hand, that total inequality variation is principally                     affected by the percentage of the labor force in agriculture, followed by the                     institutional factors union density and decommodification, and only then by                     globalization. On the other hand, longitudinal variation in inequality, while                     still dominated by the percentage of the labor force in agriculture, is also                     principally affected by aspects of globalization, such as southern import                     penetration and direct investment outflow, and to a lesser extent by migration.                     In other words, globalization explains the longitudinal trend of increasing                     inequality that took place within many industrial countries better than it does                     cross‐sectional inequality differences among countries.

Campbell, Heather Schoenfeld	American Journal of Sociology	118	5	2013-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1375-1423	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Comparative historical methods are used to explain the transformation of the U.S. penal order in the second half of the 20th century. The analysis of multiple state-level case studies and national-level narratives suggests that this transformation has three distinct, but interconnected, historical periods and reveals that the complex interaction between national and state-level politics and policy helps explain the growth in imprisonment between 1970 and 2001. Specifically, over time, national political competition, federal crime control policy, and federal court decisions helped create new state-level political innovation and special interest groups that compelled lawmakers to increasingly define the crime problem as a lack of punishment and to respond by putting more people in prison for longer periods of time. In turn, state-level developments facilitated increasingly radical crime control politics and policies at the national level that reflected historical traditions found in Sun Belt states.

In this study, outcomes for a randomly selected panel of Baltimore children, followed from age 6 to age 22, demonstrate that first graders’ social contexts and personal resources explain educational attainment levels in early adulthood about as well as do similar resources measured in adolescence. Years of schooling and the highest level of school attempted respond most strongly to family SES, but parental psychological support and the child’s own temperament/disposition had substantial effects on first‐grade academic outcomes. The predictive power of race, gender, SES, and neighborhood quality measured in first grade on educational status at age 22 supports Lucas’s “effectively maintained inequality.”

The theoretical significance of the subject is indicated by locating it in the larger literature on race and ethnic relations, emphasizing its place in literature that gives more attention to situa‐tional conditions than to attitudinal conditions. The role of international competition is illustrated by describing the experiences of four 17th‐century minorities: the Vaudois in the southwestern Alps, Protestants in Alsace, Catholics in the Scottish Highlands and Western Islands, and Catholics in Ireland. Five sets of general propositions are induced from these cases and supported by historical and present‐day examples.

Corning	American Journal of Sociology	105	4	2000-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 913-956	The University of Chicago Press	fla		We explore the knowledge of a probability sample of Russians in 1994 about nine events that occurred within the past 60 years. We consider three competing hypotheses about how knowledge relates to age: (1) adolescence and early adulthood constitute a critical age for acquiring knowledge of public events; (2) the unique content of an event creates age relations; (3) the primary influence on knowledge is a period effect. We also hypothesize that "years of education" has two different meanings in relation to knowledge: one about socialization that promotes state-approved images of the past, and the other about development of a cognitive sophistication that challenges such images. Partial support for each hypothesis is reported. The relation of collective knowledge to collective memory is also considered.

Recent literature proposes that the fate of cities (and their residents) has become increasingly tied to their position in international flows of investment and trade. Data on the branch locations of the world’s 500 largest multinational enterprises in 2000 are subjected to two broad types of network analytic techniques in order to analyze the “world city system.” First, 3,692 cities are analyzed in terms of three measures of point centrality. Second, blockmodeling techniques are employed to generalize further about the positions and roles played by cities in the system. These techniques are used to trace out the structure of the world city system, locate cities in the context of a global urban hierarchy, and explore the degree to which this diverges from a simple one‐to‐one matching of cities onto nation‐states in the world system.

The authors predict that status processes, including status differences and the differences in rewards and costs that result, will produce differences in ability test scores between high‐status and low‐status individuals. In three controlled experiments, participants randomly assigned low status scored lower on a standard test of mental ability (the Raven Progressive Matrices) than did participants assigned high status. For both men and women, the difference in ability test score between low‐status and high‐status participants was about half a standard deviation. The results suggest the need to account for status differences in any attempt ot measure mental ability accurately.

Under these conditions, the risk and uncertainty of exchange provide the opportunity for partners to demonstrate their trustworthiness. This study develops the theoretical implications of this proposition and conducts an experimental test that compares levels of both trust and commitment in two forms of direct exchange, negotiated and reciprocal. The results support the classical proposition, showing that reciprocal exchange produces stronger trust and affective commitment than negotiated exchange, and that behaviors signaling the partner's trustworthiness have greater impact on trust in reciprocal exchange.

Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork among evicted tenants in high-poverty neighborhoods, this article presents a new explanation for urban survival, one that emphasizes the importance of disposable ties formed between strangers. To meet their most pressing needs, evicted families often relied more on new acquaintances than on kin. Disposable ties facilitated the flow of various resources, but often bonds were brittle and fleeting. The strategy of forming, using, and burning disposable ties allowed families caught in desperate situations to make it from one day to the next, but it also bred instability and fostered misgivings among peers.

Drawing on six years of police reports, census data, and survey data of Chicago communities, the study evaluates alternative hypotheses about the social organization of racial hate crime derived from social disorganization, resource competition, and defended communities perspectives. Multivariate analyses controlling for spatial autocorrelation reveal that antiblack hate crimes, in contrast to general forms of crime, are more likely in relatively organized communities with high levels of informal social control. Conversely, antiwhite incidents appear more numerous in traditionally disorganized communities, especially those characterized by residential instability.

Sallaz	American Journal of Sociology	115	2	2009-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 327-364	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Research on the emotional consequences of interactive service work remains inconclusive in large part because scholars have not analyzed the mechanisms that lead frontline employees to adopt the meanings disseminated by their employers. The authors argue that the theoretical framework best suited for remedying this situation is the negotiated order perspective. It suggests that whether employees adopt a corporate‐sanctioned meaning, and with what emotional effect, depends on the conjunction of several social conditions. The authors also propose a novel analytical strategy that can identify these conditional pathways and formalize the combinatorial logic of the negotiated order perspective: fuzzy‐set techniques. To illustrate the utility of this approach, the article examines a university hospital that has tried to create a more meaningful and emotionally rewarding work environment for its nursing staff. Consistent with expectations, findings show that employees can embrace the same corporate‐sanctioned meaning under different sets of conditions and with different emotional consequences.

Many argue that their proliferation has allowed an expansion of advocacy without an accompanying growth in civic engagement. This article asks if there has been significant recent growth of NMAOs and if those organizations have displaced membership advocacy organizations (MAOs). The authors find no evidence for a proportional increase of NMAOs since the 1960s. Further, among all organizations in three populations—peace, women's issues, and human rights—NMAOs have not displaced MAOs. In particular, the authors find that MAO density shapes NMAO founding, as membership groups provide a base for professional advocacy. These findings challenge the notion that U.S. civic life has undergone a systemic transformation away from organizational forms that promote civic engagement.

With data from an expanded version of the May 1988 Current Population Survey, this study finds that differences in the length of specialized training across occupations and industries, together with a few demographic and human capital attributes, are able to completely explain all of the sex composition effects among women and men, whites and blacks. The central results are difficult to reconcile with the devaluation hypothesis but are remarkably consistent with the specialized human capital hypothesis.

They argue that social context plays an important role in mediating whether and how adoptees pursue ethnic exploration. Employing a grounded theory analysis of a uniquely representative sample of Korean adoptees, they find that historical period and institutional setting shape the availability, content, and experience of exploration. The article concludes with a discussion of the implications for research on racial stratification, ethnic assimilation, ethnic identity, and transracial adoptees.

The analysis considers the actions of both subject and other in encounters where exchange relationships are possible and include perceptions of others' and own physical attractiveness. Results indicate that subjects are more likely to enter play and to cooperate with others they find attractive. Men who see themselves as more attractive more often cooperate than other men, while women who see themselves as more attractive less often cooperate than other women. In addition, subjects who rate themselves as highly attractive are more likely to cooperate with others they see as also highly attractive. Subjects expect others whom they see as attractive to cooperate more often. At the same time, the effect of perceived attractiveness on choice is independent of these expectations, supporting the hypothesis that attractiveness is a “taste” or “benefit” for actors in exchange relationships.

The nature of this paradox, its origins, and the means of transcending it are illustrated primarily through an analysis of Marx's theory of metabolic rift, which, it is contended, offers important classical foundations for environmental sociology.

Since new organizational forms jeopardize existing interests, institutional entrepreneurs recombine prevalent cultural materials to frame the form as necessary, valid, and appropriate. When rival entrepreneurs promote incompatible frames, the frame that enjoys greater political support from the state, professions, and other organizations becomes ascendant. Proponents of losing frames can exit, migrate, or convert to the ascendant frame. A case study of the creation of nonprofit consumer watchdog organizations demonstrates how the boundaries of an organizational form and its cultural contents are shaped by politics.

The technical properties of                     sidewalk encounters between particular black street men and                     middle‐class white female residents of Greenwich Village are compared                     with interactions expected from studies of other conversation situations. The                     men attempt to initiate conversations and to deal with efforts to close them in                     ways that betray the practical ethics fundamental to all social interaction. In                     this way they undermine the requisites not just for “urbanism as a way                     of life,” but the bases for how sociability generally proceeds. These                     acts of “interactional vandalism” both reflect and                     contribute to the larger structural conditions shaping the local scene.

Roscigno	American Journal of Sociology	110	3	2004-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 672-708	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Heightened competition has resulted in an intensified search for practices that enhance organizational success—success often defined in terms of heightened worker effort. This article suggests that the interplay between organizational and job‐level practices determines the extent to which organizations can be successful and workers’ well‐being can also be protected. These relations are analyzed with a unique data set on organizational practices, managerial behavior, and work‐life experiences from 204 English‐language organizational ethnographies. The analyses reveal configurations of practices associated with both positive and negative outcomes for organizations and workers. Configurations associated with organizational success include both positive organizational‐level and positive job‐level practices, such as employee involvement, competent management, and on‐the‐job training. The findings suggest that although the goals of organizational success and worker dignity are sometimes at odds, they can also be complementary.

In these analyses, the authors demonstrate the utility of distinguishing not only between white‐biracial and nonwhite‐biracial families and but also between even more refined measures of biracial families (e.g., white father/Asian mother). The authors find that, in most cases, biracial families provide comparable or greater economic and cultural resources to their children than do their monoracial counterparts, but offer fewer advantages in interactional/social resources. This overall pattern remains even after sociodemographic factors are taken into consideration. Exceptions to this pattern also are identified and explored. Implications for our understanding of racial stratification, interracial relations, and the role of both human agency and constraints on intergenerational transmission of resources are discussed.

Yeh, Shelby Stewman, Hiroko Dodge	American Journal of Sociology	103	3	1997-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 566-632	The University of Chicago Press	fla		A comparative statics model is utilized to examine mechanisms of gender inequality: gender distribution (skew), gender segregation (composition), occupational captivity, hierarchical ceilings, glass ceilings, and internal labor market (ILM) structure/network linkages. The analysis examines new linkages between sex segregation and glass ceilings; two elements of sex segregation–composition and captivity; and two elements of glass ceilings–pathways inside and outside one's original ILM. Gender‐specific career trajectories were constructed to analyze women's career opportunities in 22 occupational ILMs in the U.S. federal government for two periods between 1962 and 1989, demonstrating how to extract career implications from much shorter periods of time. There is a very large differential effect by gender when staying within one's occupational ILM; however, when pathways that include changing ILMs are considered, women's opportunities to enter the top tier become almost equivalent to those for men in the second period.

It addresses organizational ecology's resource‐partitioning theory, which explains market histories with scale economies and crowding, and it shows that some main predictions of this theory can be restated in terms of structural properties of the A'‐dimensional Euclidean space. As resource‐space dimensionality increases, the changing niche configurations open opportunities for specialists. The proposed approach draws upon the sphere‐packing problem in geometry. The model also explains new observations, and its findings apply to a range of crowding and network models in sociology.

The model extends Herfindahl's index of concentration by bringing in the recursiveness of Bonacich's method. Using Newcomb's study of a college fraternity, we find empirical support for the contention that fragility reduces future growth in status. Applications of the model to input-output networks among industries in the U.S. economy and to hiring networks among academic departments are also presented. Implications for future research are discussed.

But how much will future generations benefit from these gains, and will black and white Americans benefit equally? Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, this study examines differences in the process of educational reproduction for black and white Americans. The approach considers the implication of race and education differences in marriage, assortative mating, and fertility in the parent generation on the distribution of schooling in the next generation. The analyses use a dynamic, multidimensional model that allows for intergenerational pathways at the individual, family, and population levels. The results show that these demographic mechanisms play an important role in explaining race differences in educational reproduction. Ignoring these pathways underestimates intergenerational effects for whites and overestimates them for blacks.

Ansell	American Journal of Sociology	103	2	1997-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 359-90	The University of Chicago Press	fla		How can abstract symbols provide the basis for organizational cohesion? In the early 1890s, the general strike provided such a symbol for French trade unions. In rallying around this symbol, the unions broke free from competing political loyalties and brought about a fundamental realignment of the French labor movement. The article argues that organizational cohesion emerges through the interplay between powerful symbols, political discourse, and social or interor‐ganizational networks. Using archival records and a statistical analysis of the watershed vote for the general strike, the author demonstrates how the organizing power of this symbol was embedded in local multitrade union federations known as bourses du travail and in the corporatist discourse they evoked.

Montgomery	American Journal of Sociology	117	1	2011-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 46-89	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Building on Preston and Campbell’s two-sex model of intergenerational transmission, this article provides a theoretical analysis of the dynamics of the racial distribution in black-white-mulatto systems. The author shows that “bounded” patterns of racial classification and switching imply long-run racial homogeneity in the absence of differential reproduction. Beyond the theoretical analysis, the author attempts to account for the dramatic growth of the white population share in Puerto Rico in the early 20th century. Because the effects of racial classification and differential reproduction were roughly offsetting, the observed growth of the white share can be attributed almost entirely to racial switching.

China's township‐village government‐owned enterprises (TVEs) outperform state‐owned enterprises (SOEs) in growth rate and productivity. Three explanations are proposed in the literature: (1) TVEs represent informal or ambiguous private property rights, which are most efficient in partial reform. (2) The small size and scale of township‐village governments as industrial corporations allows officials to monitor TVEs directly and to limit their wherewithal for cross‐subsidizing. (3) Strict market disciplines facing TVEs render indirect market monitoring to mitigate agency problems effectively. Analyses of Jiangyin data show that (a) while both superior to local SOEs, village and township enterprises share similar productivity and (b) the scale of township‐village corporations slightly increases productivity. I conclude that local state corporatism should be revised to include market discipline as an effective governance mechanism.

Adopting a concept of power as a contingent outcome in a social transaction, they emphasize that not only dominant, institutionalized power but also resistance to institutionalized authority draws from a common pool of sociocultural resources, including symbolic, linguistic, organizational, and material phenomena. Although such acts of resistance may not cumulate to produce institutional change, they may nonetheless have consequences beyond the specific social transaction: the authors propose that a chief means for extending the social consequences of resistance is to transform an act of resistance into a story about resistance. Based upon an appreciation of the structural conditions of power and authority, stories of resistance can become instructions about both the sources and the limitations of power. Because such stories are told in interaction with other stories, they become part of a stream of sociocultural knowledge about how social structures work to distribute power and disadvantage.

Schroeder	American Journal of Sociology	115	3	2009-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 805-831	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The relative income or income status hypothesis implies that people should be happier when they live among the poor. Findings on neighborhood effects suggest, however, that living in a poorer neighborhood reduces, not enhances, a person's happiness. Using data from the American National Election Study linked to income data from the U.S. census, the authors find that Americans tend to be happier when they reside in richer neighborhoods (consistent with neighborhood studies) in poorer counties (as predicted by the relative income hypothesis). Thus it appears that individuals in fact are happier when they live among the poor, as long as the poor do not live too close.

Following Faulkner, it is hypothesized that a focused identity is helpful in gaining entrée into an arena but subsequently leads to increasing limitations. The labor market for feature‐film actors is analyzed via career patterns recorded in the Internet Movie Database and interviews with key informants, allowing the article to distinguish between typecasting effects and those due to underlying skill differences or social networks. Important implications are drawn for research on identity formation in various social arenas, on categorical boundaries in external labor markets, and on the actor‐position interplay inherent in market dynamics.

Using California data, this study shows that children living very close to a child previously diagnosed with autism are more likely to be diagnosed with autism. An underlying social influence mechanism involving information diffusion drives this result, contributing to 16% of the increase in prevalence over 2000–2005. We eliminate competing explanations (i.e., residential sorting, environmental toxicants, and viral transmission) through seven tests and show that information diffusion simultaneously contributed to the increased prevalence, spatial clustering, and decreasing age of diagnosis.

While social movement theorists have suggested that economic actors weigh the costliness of protests, the author considers the vulnerability of movement targets to both the cost of disruptions in routine transactions and the cost of conceding to movement demands. By addressing the magnitude of these costs and their interaction, the author derives an economic opportunity structure to predict the receptivity of economic actors to movement demands and the likely struggles among them over the decision to yield. Also, this cost‐assessment approach reveals patterns of vulnerability across economic sectors to the costs of disruptive mobilization. The author tests this analysis based on case studies of the responses of economic actors to civil rights mobilization in the 1960s in five Southern localities. These cases depict how the character of protest and variation in the configuration of business communities defined the range of movement outcomes from relatively swift accommodation to persistent resistance.

Heise	American Journal of Sociology	109	5	2004-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1109-1136	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The authors examine self‐reported emotional experiences of individuals in a large probability sample of Americans, using two theories in the sociology of emotions as lenses to apprehend social order in emotional processes. Viewing emotions as indicators of individuals’ positions in a three‐dimensional affective space (e.g., Heise, Smith‐Lovin, MacKinnon), the authors find emotional station correlates with a variety of social structural, circumstantial, and individual‐level variables. Viewing emotions as the focus of emotion norms and emotion management efforts (e.g., Hochschild), the authors arrive at new postulates about how transformations of emotions can be achieved in social support groups and other types of social institutions. A further demonstration that emotions reflect multiple sociological realities develops through the examination of sex differences in emotional experience. The authors find that there are concrete though subtle sex differences in the experience, structure, transformation, and contextual significance of emotions. The analyses suggest complementarities between affect control and emotion management that may have been overlooked in other studies.

Carroll	American Journal of Sociology	119	3	2013-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 790-832	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Drawing on theories of social movements and organizations, the authors examine how the expanding presence of commercial organizations and the growing diversity of their forms foster policy change securing rights for a group of challengers. In particular, they suggest that these organizations can operate as bridges and can signal the legitimacy of the group in a community. Empirically, they analyze organizations linked to lesbians/gays and the promulgation of local ordinances banning discrimination, using a data set covering American counties from 1972 to 2008. Using hazard models, they find that the rate of policy enactment increases (1) with greater presence of lesbian/gay commercial organizations, particularly of those linking toward the larger community, and (2) with greater diversity of their organizational forms. Finally, they find evidence that commercial and political organizations are linked in a complex way.

The authors conceptualize agency as a temporally embedded process of social engagement, informed by the past (in its “iterational” or habitual aspect) but also oriented toward the future (as a “projective” capacity to imagine alternative possibilities) and toward the present (as a “practical‐evaluative” capacity to contextualize past habits and future projects within the contingencies of the moment).

For example, formal models of fertility decline following Henry and Coale take specific childbearing distributions to indicate “natural fertility,” where couples take no intentional action to manage their reproduction. This article argues that this mode of inference can be valid only when the cultural repertoires that mediate between intentions and actions are well established. Using data from 18 African countries, the author compares women’s self‐reported intentions to those attributed to them under standard demographic models and finds significant discrepancies. The link between intentions and outcomes is itself a social product.

The evidence reveals a robust relationship between income inequality and income segregation, an effect that is larger for black families than for white families. In addition, income inequality affects income segregation primarily through its effect on the large-scale spatial segregation of affluence rather than by affecting the spatial segregation of poverty or by altering small-scale patterns of income segregation.

Results confirm that even late in life self‐directedness of work continues to affect intellectual functioning and self‐directedness of orientation. These psychological characteristics, in turn, affect social‐structural position in ways that increase disparities between the advantaged and disadvantaged. From a historical and societal perspective, the findings suggest that the occupational self‐directedness of a society’s workers may affect its social norms, values, and modes of production.

Living standards were examined in terms of four measures: home ownership, car ownership, schooling after marriage, and a subjective evaluation by the respondent. Israel is a strategic site for examining the interplay between parental wealth and living standards because of the particular organization of its housing market. The study focuses on the role of parental wealth in the early years of marriage because young couples in Israel have great financial need at that time but are liquidity constrained. The main finding is that, net of indicators of parental SES and a couple's own income, parental wealth plays a substantial role in the living standards of young adults.

Compared here using event‐history analysis is how household divisions of paid and unpaid labor affect marital stability in the former West Germany, where policy reinforced male breadwinner families, and the United States, where policy remains silent regarding the private sphere. In Germany, any moves away from separate gendered spheres in terms of either wives' relative earnings or husbands' relative participation in housework increase the risk of divorce. In the United States, however, the more stable couples are those that adapt by displaying greater gender equity. These results highlight that policy shapes how gender gets done in the intimate sphere, and that reinforcement of a gendered division of labor may be detrimental to marital stability.

The authors argue that the microlevel network explanations that dominate the research on conversion cannot by themselves account for the unusual success of Protestantism in Korea. Instead, events in East Asia in macrolevel, geopolitical networks provoked nationalist rituals that altered the stakes of conversion to either promote or retard conversion network growth. At the turn of the 20th century, unequal treaties both opened this region to missionaries and provoked nationalist rituals. In China and Japan, these rituals generated patriotic identities by attacking Christianity, and network growth slowed or reversed. In Korea, Christianity became compatible with these rituals, and conversion networks grew. This example highlights the greater explanatory power of nested networks for understanding international religious diffusion, relative to microlevel accounts alone.

Miller, Rodney Stark	American Journal of Sociology	107	6	2002-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1399-1423	The University of Chicago Press	fla		It has long been assumed in sociology that gender differences in religiousness are a product of differential socialization. Yet, there is little empirical support for this assumption. To address this gap in the literature, this study draws on an extensive investigation of the relationship between differential socialization and differential religiousness. Using the American General Social Surveys and the World Values Survey, this article analyzes the relationship between traditional gender attitudes and gender differences in religious beliefs and behavior. Surprisingly, these data show no relationship between the two. Therefore, a new set of hypotheses based on an alternative model involving risk preference is proposed. Results strongly support this new approach. Women are more religious than men to the extent that being irreligious constitutes risk‐taking behavior. This model is able to predict differential religiousness in a wide variety of religious and cultural settings. Implications of these findings are discussed.

While mainstream economists hold that investor behavior is independent of investor identity and therefore call for the parallel treatment of domestic and foreign firms, their critics hold that indigenous investors are more dedicated than their foreign counterparts and therefore call for industrial policies designed to cultivate and defend native entrepreneurs. Who is correct? The author uses a unique combination of qualitative and quantitative data to document and account for the relative stability and dynamism of indigenous investors in the Dominican Republic’s largest export processing zone and thereby brings economic sociology back from the margins of development theory—and development theory back into the heartland of sociology.

Sutton	American Journal of Sociology	119	3	2013-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 715-746	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Recent studies argue that cultural and political-economic shifts have led to a sea change in penal regimes among modern Western societies, resulting in more punitive social policies in general and a trend toward higher incarceration rates in particular. This is a special case of a wider argument that globalization has led to a decline in state autonomy and convergence on a market-based model of economic and social policy. This thesis has been challenged by the empirical literature on welfare states, which finds persistent cross-national diversity in institutional structures, policies, and patterns of inequality. Focusing on incarceration rates as the outcome of interest, this study evaluates these arguments by applying a Bayesian change-point model to four decades of data from 15 countries. Results show that a regime shift did occur but that incarceration rates increased mainly among countries with unregulated labor markets, decentralized polities, or weak labor unions. Profound institutional differences persist and are fateful for incarceration trajectories.

They argue that socialism was made into a laboratory of economic knowledge during the socialist calculation debate of the 1920s and 1930s. An extensive debate during the Cold War is also documented and shows that a transnational network continued to be organized around attempts to connect the results obtained in the socialist laboratory with debates and struggles in Western economics. Finally, the drafting of transition blueprints in postcommunist Eastern Europe after 1989, with the participation of American economists, is shown to be a continuation of this transnational network.

Integrating these two approaches yields the thesis that social networks affect economic growth via enforcing informal institutions. The article focuses on the economic payoff of kinship networks in the context of China’s rural industrialization to argue that kin solidarity and kin trust played an important role in protecting the property rights of private entrepreneurs and reducing transaction costs during the early stages of market reform, when formal property rights laws were ineffective and market institutions underdeveloped. Data from 366 villages show that the strength of kinship networks has large positive effects on the count and workforce size of private rural enterprises and insignificant effects on collective enterprises.

This article improves upon previous research by providing a model of social capital that has explicit links to theories of social capital and that analyzes multiple indicators of social capital over a 20‐year period. The results do not consistently support Putnam's claim of a decline in social capital, showing instead some decline in a general measure of social capital, a decline in trust in individuals, no general decline in trust in institutions, and no decline in associations.

This perspective cannot account for variations in British colonial tax administration in India, circa 1770 to 1855. The British organized land revenue collection and administration as a whole through two different schemes. Both systems initially adopted a rhetoric of revenue maximization, but neither was decisively better matched to Indian social structure. Instead, administrators interpreted a seemingly opaque Indian society by understanding themselves as fundamentally similar to or different from Indians.

Sobolewski	American Journal of Sociology	113	2	2007-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 446-506	The University of Chicago Press	fla		A large body of research examines relationships between social class and voting behavior in the United States, but there have been no systematic studies of how occupational segregation structures voting outcomes across many local settings. This article argues that electoral outcomes in the United States are strongly influenced by inequality between men and women and between whites and nonwhites, with that inequality being rooted in occupational segregation. Republican candidates should receive their strongest electoral support in locations where occupations are highly segregated by sex and by race, particularly in settings where segregation is most vulnerable to penetration. The argument finds support in statistical analyses of county‐level variation in Republican voting in the 2004 presidential election.

Martin, Marc Dixon	American Journal of Sociology	116	1	2010-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 93-129	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Much of what we know about strikes is grounded in the context of postwar Fordism, a unique historical moment of relatively institutionalized labor‐management relations. Yet the resurgence of corporate resistance over the past quarter century, coupled with an increasingly hostile political and economic climate, has fundamentally transformed the American industrial landscape. Drawing from this research and insights on social movements and formal organizations, we expect unions will vary considerably in their response to threats. Our analysis, based on a comprehensive data set of U.S. strikes from 1984 to 2002, reveals the importance of such intramovement cleavages for strike activity and for the prospects of organized labor in the contemporary United States. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for scholarship on threat and social movement challenges more generally.

Ribar	American Journal of Sociology	103	1	1997-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 112-143	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The article provides a bridge between recent marriage market research and studies of welfare incentive effects on U.S. family formation. Estimates from state and county fixed‐effects models indicate significant effects of changing state Aid to Families with Dependent Children, food stamps, and Medicaid expenditure levels on county‐level changes in families headed by unmarried mothers. However, neither changing welfare benefit levels nor declining economic and marital opportunities could account for recent increases in female headship. The results imply that large additional cuts in welfare payment levels would lead to only small reductions in the percentage of female‐headed families with children.

This article analyzes the origins and development of these state felon disenfranchisement provisions. Because these laws tend to dilute the voting strength of racial minorities, we build on theories of group threat to test whether racial threat influenced their passage. Many felon voting bans were passed in the late 1860s and 1870s, when implementation of the Fifteenth Amendment and its extension of voting rights to African‐Americans were ardently contested. We find that large nonwhite prison populations increase the odds of passing restrictive laws, and, further, that prison and state racial composition may be linked to the adoption of reenfranchisement reforms. These findings are important for understanding restrictions on the civil rights of citizens convicted of crime and, more generally, the role of racial conflict in American political development.

Results show that cooperation decreases as social distance increases; and, that identical network‐generalized exchanges generate different amounts of trusting behavior due solely to manipulated social identity between the actors. This study demonstrates the interaction of culture and social identity on the propensity to trust and reciprocate and also reveals differing relationships between trust and reciprocation in each of the four countries, bringing into question the theoretical relationship between these cooperative behaviors.

Moreover, important racial disparities in migration patterns remain poorly understood. Drawing on data from the 2000 census, the author reappraises the link between migration and social mobility by taking relative deprivation into consideration. She examines the association between migration, disaggregated by region of origin and destination, and absolute and relative earnings and occupational prestige, separately by race. Findings lend new insight into the theoretical and stratification implications of growing racial disparities in migration patterns; while both blacks and whites who move north-south generally average lower absolute incomes than their stationary northern peers, they enjoy significantly higher relative social positions. Moreover, the relative “gains” to migration are substantially larger for blacks than for whites. The opposite patterns obtain for south-north migration.

The production of culture perspective asserts that market concentration in cultural industries inhibits diversity, but is silent about how social movements challenging corporate capitalism spur organizational birth. Organizational ecology describes how market concentration triggers anti–mass production movements, but has not examined whether the diversity of new organizations alters consumer behavior. The authors integrate these literatures to analyze how low‐power FM (LPFM) radio stations arose in response to the domination of radio by corporate chains and investigate the impact of LPFM stations on radio listening. Implications for the study of social movements, organizational ecology, and the production of culture are outlined.

Burt	American Journal of Sociology	118	3	2012-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 543-591	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The more consistent a person’s network across roles and the more relevant that consistency is for achievement, the more important agency is for understanding network effects on achievement. With network, experience, and achievement data on persons playing multiple characters in a virtual world, evidence is presented to support two conclusions: (1) About a third of network structure is consistent within persons across roles: that is, those who in one role build networks rich in access to structural holes will build similar networks in other roles; builders of closed networks also tend to build that network across roles. (2) Network consistency across roles contributes almost nothing to predicting achievement, which is instead determined by experience and the network specific to the role. The two conclusions are robust across substantively significant differences in the mix of roles combined in a multirole network (too many roles, difficult combination of roles, or roles played to overlapping audiences).

The concept of environmental contingency is introduced as a corrective. Drawing on the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and qualitative comparative analysis, the authors focus on an example involving social capital, a gene associated with a dopamine receptor (DRD2), and educational continuation beyond secondary school. For boys, (1) DRD2 risk is associated with a decreased likelihood of school continuation; (2) one configuration of social capital—high parental socioeconomic status, high parental involvement in school, and a high‐quality school—compensates for this negative relationship, consistent with environmental contingency; but (3) boys with DRD2 risk are less commonly observed in settings that are rich in social capital.

Using NES data from 1972 to 2004, the authors model trends in issue partisanship—the correlation of issue attitudes with party identification—and issue alignment—the correlation between pairs of issues—and find a substantive increase in issue partisanship, but little evidence of issue alignment. The findings suggest that opinion changes correspond more to a resorting of party labels among voters than to greater constraint on issue attitudes: since parties are more polarized, they are now better at sorting individuals along ideological lines. Levels of constraint vary across population subgroups: strong partisans and wealthier and politically sophisticated voters have grown more coherent in their beliefs. The authors discuss the consequences of partisan realignment and group sorting on the political process and potential deviations from the classic pluralistic account of American politics.

China's political trajectory is distinctive from that of other communist regimes in two ways. During its first three decades, the regime enforced unusually restrictive barriers to elite status inheritance. And during the subsequent market transition, unlike most of its counterparts, the Communist Party survived intact. Data from a multigeneration survey suggest that despite their obvious exclusion from the party and related administrative careers in the Mao era, certain prerevolution elites transmitted one type of elite status to their offspring to a surprising degree. Party elites, in contrast, were hit hard by radical Maoism but recovered quickly afterward, and their offspring inherited elite status at much higher rates.

Although most sociologists who study culture emphasize its role in post hoc sense making, sociologists of religion and social psychologists tend to focus on the role beliefs play in motivation. The dual‐process model integrates justificatory and motivational approaches by distinguishing between “discursive” and “practical” modes of culture and cognition. The author uses panel data from the National Study of Youth and Religion to illustrate the model's usefulness. Consistent with its predictions, he finds that though respondents cannot articulate clear principles of moral judgment, their choice from a list of moral‐cultural scripts strongly predicts later behavior.

Penner	American Journal of Sociology	114	s1	2008-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. S138-S170	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Genetic and other biological explanations have reemerged in recent scholarship on the underrepresentation of women in mathematics and the sciences. This study engages this debate by using international data—including math achievement scores from the Third International Mathematics and Sciences Study and country‐level data from the World Bank, the United Nations, the International Labour Organization, the World Values Survey, and the International Social Survey Programme—to demonstrate the importance of social factors and to estimate an upper bound for the impact of genetic factors. The author argues that international variation provides a valuable opportunity to present simple and powerful arguments for the continued importance of social factors. In addition, where previous research has, by and large, focused on differences in population means, this work examines gender differences throughout the distribution. The article shows that there is considerable variation in gender differences internationally, a finding not easily explained by strictly biological theories. Modeling the cross‐national variation in gender differences with country‐level predictors reveals that differences among high achievers are related to gender inequality in the labor market and differences in the overall status of men and women.

Using enthnographic data from a comparative study of two diabetes clinics, the authors further develop the fundamental cause concept in three ways. First, they provide an exposition of the constituent claims implied by an assertion of fundamental causality. Second, they show how ethnographic data can be used to explicate such claims by showing some of the mechanisms that might operate to preserve the fundamental relationship in diabetes treatment regimens. Finally, they offer elaborations and refinements of the fundamental cause concept.

Through such feedback loops, market and political arenas can develop symbiotically into relatively coherent “fields” that gradually embed actors’ orientations and activities. Using these insights, this article develops and tests a theory of European integration focusing on the case of the European Community, the first pillar of the European Union. Traders, organized interests, courts, and the EC’s policy‐making organs, over time, have produced a self‐sustaining causal system that has driven the construction of the European market and polity. The generality of this explanation to a sociology of markets and polity‐building projects is discussed in the conclusion.

Cernkovich	American Journal of Sociology	112	6	2007-05-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1603-1661	The University of Chicago Press	fla		A symbolic interactionist perspective on the emotions is presented that highlights their social character, forges links to cognitive processes, and suggests ways in which emotions influence long‐term patterns of criminal involvement. This neo‐Meadian perspective contrasts with theories of desistance that focus on the role of informal social controls and develops the view of an emotional self that flourishes somewhat independent of the major role transitions typically emphasized in sociological studies of the life course. The authors also explore ways in which attention to the emotional realms of experience adds to traditional treatments of the impact of adult transition events (e.g., the “good marriage effect”). Interviews with male and female adolescent offenders and two waves of adult follow‐up data document general patterns of association and support the argument that a social view of emotional processes is critical to a comprehensive understanding of life course patterns of criminal continuity and change.

Hannan	American Journal of Sociology	106	5	2001-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1299-1337	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article examines the effects of crowding in a market center on rates of change in organizational niche width and on organizational mortality. It proposes that, although firms with wide niches benefit from risk spreading and economies of scale, they are simultaneously exposed to intense competition. An analysis of organizational dynamics in automobile manufacturing firms in France, Germany, and Great Britain shows that competitive pressure not only increases the hazard of disbanding but also prompts organizational transformations that give rise to processes of resource partitioning. Emphasizing the content/process distinction in conceptualizing organizational change, the article finds that the process effect of changes in niche width and position increases mortality hazards.

This article argues, however, that exit is frequently the only collective action available to average people in authoritarian regimes. In such regimes, collective exit may take a variety of forms, hybridized here from the elements of traditional and modern repertoires under varying conditions of opportunity and framing. Descriptions of hybrid exit episodes from the German Democratic Republic, 1961–89, are based on annual reports by Amnesty International, on secondary sources before 1989, and, primarily, on accounts from six international presses for 1989.

Applying the approach to 48 organizational forms in the health care sector, this study suggests that the development of novel forms is affected by the positioning of their identities with respect to existing form identities in the community, by the aggregate density and size of organizations matching those existing identities, and by the amount of attention directed at identity attributes by sector participants. Findings show that the process of form emergence is subject to population‐dependent effects akin to those noted previously for organizational entries within established populations. The aggregate density and size of organizations with similar identities increase the probability of form emergence to a point (cross‐form legitimation), but highly saturated regions of the identity space tend to be uninviting to new forms (cross‐form competition).

The authors hypothesize that interlocks are spatial phenomena‐ with spatial attributes and spatial determinants. Consistent with this hypothesis, they find that local and nonlocal interlocks have different correlates. Further, three spatial structures influence interlocking: the location of a corporation's headquarters vis‐a`‐vis other corporate headquarters and upper‐class clubs, the territorial distribution of a firm's production facilities, and the spatial configuration of a corporation's ownership relations. This suggests that previous interlock research, which ignores spatial considerations, has been seriously misspecified.

Audia	American Journal of Sociology	106	2	2000-09-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 424-462	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Nearly all industries exhibit geographic concentration. Most theories of the location of industry explain the persistence of these production centers as the result of economic efficiency. This article argues instead that heterogeneity in entrepreneurial opportunities, rather than differential performance, maintains geographic concentration. Entrepreneurs need exposure to existing organizations in the industry to acquire tacit knowledge, obtain important social ties, and build self‐confidence. Thus, the current geographic distribution of production places important constraints on entrepreneurial activity. Due to these constraints, new foundings tend to reify the existing geographic distribution of production. Empirical evidence from the shoe industry supports this thesis.

It suggests that we need to distinguish between experts and expertise as requiring two distinct modes of analysis that are not reducible to one another. It analyzes expertise as a network linking together agents, devices, concepts, and institutional and spatial arrangements. It also suggests rethinking how abstraction and power were analyzed in the sociology of professions. The utility of this approach is demonstrated by using it to explain the recent precipitous rise in autism diagnoses. This article shows that autism remained a rare disorder until the deinstitutionalization of mental retardation created a new institutional matrix within which a new set of actors—the parents of children with autism in alliance with psychologists and therapists—were able to forge an alternative network of expertise.

This article takes issue with the modernist position. Drawing on primary and secondary evidence from the Netherlands, England, and other early modern polities, it documents the existence of movements and ideologies that must be classified as national and nationalist by the modernists' own criteria. It is then argued that some nationalist discourses had medieval roots and that they were no less nationalistic than the nationalisms of the French Revolution. In the conclusion, the theoretical premises of the modernist position are subjected to critical examination.

Spires	American Journal of Sociology	117	1	2011-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1-45	The University of Chicago Press	fla		In the study of civil society, Tocqueville-inspired research has helped illuminate important connections between associations and democracy, while corporatism has provided a robust framework for understanding officially approved civil society organizations in authoritarian regimes. Yet neither approach accounts for the experiences of ostensibly illegal grassroots nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in an authoritarian state. Drawing on fieldwork in China, I argue that grassroots NGOs can survive in an authoritarian regime when the state is fragmented and when censorship keeps information local. Moreover, grassroots NGOs survive only insofar as they refrain from democratic claims-making and address social needs that might fuel grievances against the state. For its part, the state tolerates such groups as long as particular state agents can claim credit for any good works while avoiding blame for any problems. Grassroots NGOs and an authoritarian state can thus coexist in a “contingent symbiosis” that—far from pointing to an inevitable democratization—allows ostensibly illegal groups to operate openly while relieving the state of some of its social welfare obligations.

The recent exchanges between Glenn Firebaugh and William J. Dixon and Terry Boswell suggest the contentious nature of this debate. This study analyzes models similar to those tested in previous research but with data from earlier time points to examine the long‐term effects of foreign capital penetration. Accumulated stocks of foreign capital/GDP in 1938 have a short‐term (five‐year) positive effect on economic growth followed by a 20‐year lagged negative effect on economic growth beginning in 1960 and lasting at least 30 years. Similar effects are found using a second indicator of foreign investment dependence, debits on investment income, for the 1950–90 period.   The international migration of capital has facilitated development of the world's natural resources and has been instrumental in transmitting the direct effects of the industrial revolution from area to area. Thereby it has helped to increase the quantities and varieties of goods and services generally available and has raised living standards for some or most of the world's populations. (Cleona Lewis, Debtor and Creditor Countries, 1948)   Following an initial growth spurt this (foreign investment) will create an industrial structure in which monopoly is predominant, labor is insufficiently absorbed, and there is underutiliza‐tion of the productive forces. Thus, the peripheral countries that adopt this path of uneven development based on income inequality and foreign capital imports will experience economic stagnation, under‐ and unemployment, and increasing margin‐alization of the population relative to countries that are less

Intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) represent an important attempt to span this abyss. The authors use a network approach to demonstrate that the connections between two countries, through joint membership in the same IGOs, are associated with a large positive influence on the FDI that flows between them. Moreover, they show that this effect occurs not only in the case of connections through economic IGOs but also through those with social and cultural mandates. This demonstrates that relational governance is important and feasible in the global context, even for the most risky transactions. The authors also examine the interdependence between the IGO network and the domestic institutions of states. Social and cultural IGO connections do more and economic IGO connections less to increase FDI when the target country is more democratic.

Yet the Victorian authorities rarely and only reluctantly enforced homosexuality laws. Moreover, Wilde’s sexual predilections had long been common knowledge in London before his trials without affecting the dramatist's wide popularity. Focusing on the seemingly inconsistent Victorian attitudes toward homosexuality and the dynamics of the Oscar Wilde affair, this article develops a general theory of scandal as the disruptive publicity of transgression. The study of scandal reveals the effects of publicity on norm enforcement and throws into full relief the dramaturgical nature of the public sphere and norm work in society.

John Levi Martin	American Journal of Sociology	109	1	2003-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1-49	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Field theory is a more or less coherent approach in the social sciences whose essence is the explanation of regularities in individual action by recourse to position vis‐à‐vis others. Position in the field indicates the potential for a force exerted on the person, but a force that impinges “from the inside” as opposed to external compulsion. Motivation is accordingly considered to be the paramount example of social structure in action, as opposed to a residue of chance or freedom. While field theory is often castigated for its necessarily tautological definition, this may be far more of an advantage than a defect. Field theory offers social scientists a combination of analytical insight and attention to the concrete; further, the implicit definition of “explanation” that it brings is one that, unlike conventional sociological definitions, is internally consistent and in accord with everyday usage.

The materiality of AIDS campaign objects and of the urban settings in which they are displayed structures how the public interprets their messages. Ethnographic observation of AIDS media in situ and interview data reveal how the materiality of objects and places shapes the availability of AIDS knowledge in Accra, Ghana. Significantly for AIDS organizations, these material conditions often systematically obstruct access to AIDS knowledge for particular groups. Attending to materiality rethinks how scholars assess the cultural power of media.

Based on an ethnography of the grassroots state in moments of unrest in China, the authors identify three microfoundations of Chinese authoritarianism: protest bargaining, legal-bureaucratic absorption, and patron-clientelism. Adopting, respectively, the logics of market exchange, rule-bound games, and interpersonal bonds, these mechanisms have the effect of depoliticizing social unrest and constitute a lived experience of authoritarian domination as a non-zero-sum situation, totalizing and transparent yet permissive of room for maneuvering and bargaining. This heuristic framework calls for bringing the subjective experience of subordination back into the theorizing of state domination.

When local solidarities are ignored, the weakness of conventional aggregate models is easily misinterpreted as evidence of generic destructuration, and standard postmodernist formulations are accordingly difficult to resist. Although local structuration is often regarded as sociologically trivial, the available evidence suggests that such class analytic processes as closure, exploitation, and collective action emerge more clearly at the level of disaggregate occupations than conventional aggregate classes.

This study addresses, for the first time, the role of referral contacts on workers’ performance. Using employees’ hiring and performance data in a call center, the author examines the performance implications over time of hiring new workers via employee referrals. When assessing whether referrals are more productive than nonreferrals, the author also considers the relationship between employee productivity and turnover. This study finds that referrals are initially more productive than nonreferrals, but longitudinal analyses emphasize posthire social processes among socially connected employees. This article demonstrates that the effect of referral ties continues beyond the hiring process, having long‐term effects on employee attachment to the firm and on performance.

Wesley Younts	American Journal of Sociology	103	3	1997-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 692-732	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Two types of expectations are proposed to guide social interaction: those one holds for herself (first‐order expectations) and those one believes others hold for her (second‐order expectations). Also, interaction is assumed to be guided by three motives: contributing to group performance, preserving status, and facilitating interaction. These points are developed by formally incorporating ideas regarding reflected self‐appraisals, dramaturgical accounts of the interaction order, and expectancy‐value theory into status characteristics theory. When first‐ and second‐order expectations conflict and an actor's motives are equally weighted, it is suggested that second‐order expectations guide interaction. An initial experiment provides empirical support and insight for discussion.

McLean	American Journal of Sociology	111	5	2006-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1463-1568	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The birth of a new form of business organization, the partnership system, in Renaissance Florence is examined closely in order to discover the social processes of invention in that extraordinarily inventive place. Stated generally, the processes of invention the authors discover there are transposition, refunctionality, and catalysis across multiple social networks. Specifically, political co‐optation of cambio bankers in the aftermath of the Ciompi revolt induced the transposition of domestic guild methods to the international plane, thereby changing their purpose and their reach. Subsequent social absorption through marriage of these elevated bankers into the victorious political alliance infused partnership with the multiplex logic (and often money) of dowry, thereby reproducing partnership systems as an integral component in post‐Ciompi republicanism. Medieval organizational logics of patrilineage and guild were transformed into Renaissance organizational logics of marriage and clientage. The origins of financial capitalism are partly rooted in this elite social‐network response to class revolt.

Morgan, Monica Prasad	American Journal of Sociology	114	5	2009-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1350-1394	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This article examines the origins of tax systems. Through a historical comparison of France and the United States, and analysis of several shadow cases, the article explains why the United States has relied more heavily on progressive income taxation than France, which has favored regressive sales taxes. This study traces the origins of these two tax systems to the early 20th century, arguing that decisions about tax structure were shaped by resistance to the concentration of economic power in the United States and the centralization of state power in France. In the United States, the rapid concentration of economic power in the late 19th century spurred a political movement for a tax with clear redistributive purposes. In France, resistance to the centralization of state power and concomitant fears of “fiscal inquisition” weakened the drive for an effective income tax, leaving the state to rely on consumption taxes to meet its revenue needs. These 19th‐century movements of resistance to modernization shaped the foundations of contemporary political economy.

Using the resource‐partitioning model of organizational ecology, this article shows that these two apparently contradictory trends are fundamentally interrelated. Hypotheses developed here refine the way scale competition among generalist organizations is modeled and improve the theoretical development of the sociological bases for the appeal of specialist organizations' products, especially those related to organizational identity. Evidence drawn from qualitative and quantitative research provides strong support for the theory. The article offers a brief discussion of the theoretical and substantive issues involved in application of the model to other industries and to other cultures.

In this study the author finds the social conformity theorization most often used in network analysis important but incomplete. Network ties are frequently influential despite little or no direct contact between ego and alter and little or no motivation to conform. Similarly, “structural availability” works not only by freeing an actor from conformity‐inducing constraints but also by indicating a relative absence of social and cultural support. This absence motivates individuals for religious innovation. Finally, while network location strongly determines who converts, the individual experience of life problems remains a causal factor, and, in a small but irreducible number of cases, actors clearly exercise agency over their network locations.

We reverse the imagery and propose that early founding of a nonprofit organization in one domain imprints a community with a general institutional legacy of collective civic action. Consequently, the community is more likely to later establish new nonprofit organizations in a different domain. Empirically, we show that Norwegian communities that were the earliest to establish mutual fire insurance organizations and mutual savings banks in the 19th century were more likely to experience foundings of cooperative stores in the 20th century. We discuss how the founding of formal nonprofit organizations creates an institutional legacy that amplifies variations in the civic capacity of communities and outline how it complements accounts of organizational imprinting.

The argument here presented counters this emerging consensus. Reexamining the case of the Israeli kibbutzim, the authors show that individuals who grew up in the kibbutzim's communal education system were in fact often attracted to their peers, and only rarely did they develop sexual aversion toward these peers. This article offers an alternative explanation to the problem of incest avoidance and the incest taboo, one that brings sociological factors back into the picture.

A comparative ethnographic approach is used to observe shifts in the discussions of four fledgling activist groups. In each group, implicit discursive rules, often set off by minor comments and events, authorize some options and silence others. Although such rules emerge without deliberation or explicit decision making, they shape the group’s sense of possibility into the future. This study contributes both a new understanding of the role of contingency in collective activism and a method for using ethnographic observation to locate subtle causal mechanisms in social life.

A quantitative analysis of administrative and survey data finds that eviction is commonplace in inner-city black neighborhoods and that women from those neighborhoods are evicted at significantly higher rates than men. A qualitative analysis of ethnographic data based on fieldwork among evicted tenants and their landlords reveals multiple mechanisms propelling this discrepancy. In poor black neighborhoods, eviction is to women what incarceration is to men: a typical but severely consequential occurrence contributing to the reproduction of urban poverty.

While previous work emphasized macrolevel, impersonal factors that counteract this tendency, this article looks at how individuals may counteract it in everyday interaction. Two microlevel counterbalances to economic homophily are examined with unique data on partnerships among Tory and Whig merchants in 18th-century Bristol, England. No conclusive support is found for the first examined counterbalance, which presumes that cross-group social relations, such as joint civic activities, induce parallel economic relations. Instead, the analysis shows that Tory-Whig partnerships were facilitated by the practice of choosing cross-party partners of unequal professional prominence. Such professionally unequal relations involve tacit status subordination, which reduces the relation-specific uncertainty associated with transacting across a salient identity division. The results highlight the potential of uncertainty avoidance to sustain inequality between social groups and suggest unexplored contingencies to theories of status homophily.

Messner, Richard Rosenfeld	American Journal of Sociology	108	4	2003-01-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 844-875	The University of Chicago Press	fla		This research examines the effects of social context on support for the death penalty using individual‐level data from the 1974–98 General Social Survey (GSS), which have been linked with aggregate‐level data on homicide rates and sociodemographic, political, and economic characteristics. Consistent with instrumental, social threat, and constructionist perspectives, this study finds that residents of areas with higher homicide rates, a larger proportion of blacks, and a more conservative political climate are significantly more likely to support the death penalty, net of compositional differences. These results warrant further attention to contextual and individual sources of public support for the death penalty.

Mathias	American Journal of Sociology	118	5	2013-03-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 1246-1283	The University of Chicago Press	fla		In the latter half of the 20th century, countries abolished the death penalty en masse. What factors help to explain this global trend? Conventional analyses explain abolition by focusing primarily on state level political processes. This article contributes to these studies by analyzing world cultural factors that lend to the abolition trend. The main finding in three separate models on full, ordinary, and de facto cumulative measures of abolition show that the global sacralization of the individual, measured as the institutionalization of the human rights regime, represents a significant driver of states’ abolition. Countries’ predominant religion is also found to significantly affect the probability of abolition: predominantly Catholic nation-states are most likely to abolish the death penalty, and predominantly Muslim nation-states are least likely to abolish. These findings provide evidence for world cultural factors that structure the abolition trend globally.

O’Rand	American Journal of Sociology	110	1	2004-07-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 123-160	The University of Chicago Press	fla		The “winners” in today’s winner‐take‐all labor markets are differentiated by advanced levels of educational attainment, especially higher degrees. This article applies a sociological model of cumulative dis/advantage to the baby‐boom cohort to examine whether life course timing differences in educational attainment help explain wage differentials by midlife. It finds that advantaged social origins lead to early postsecondary completion of degrees, which, in turn, yield higher wages. A pathway of cumulative disadvantage is also evident, where those least advantaged exit schooling early in life, do not return as adults, and earn low wages. In a middle path, advantaged social origins promote adult school attainment primarily for those without degrees but generally without the wage boosts associated with attainment earlier in life.

Babb	American Journal of Sociology	108	3	2002-11-01T00:00:00Z	pp. 533-579	The University of Chicago Press	fla		Since the 1970s, market‐based economic policies have been institutionalized as a nearly global policy paradigm. Using four national case studies, this article shows that economic and financial globalization played a critical role in fostering the transition to neoliberal policies, but that local institutional conditions were decisive in shaping the nature and meaning of the shift. While the analysis finds that developing countries appear more dependent upon direct external pressures than developed ones, it also shows that institutionalized patterns of state‐society relations determined the way in which neoliberal transitions were carried out, somewhat irrespectively of the level of economic development. In Chile and Britain, poorly mediated distributional conflict created the ideological conditions for a “monetarist” revolution. In Mexico and France, on the other hand, neoliberalism was understood mainly as a necessary step to adapt the country to the international economy.
