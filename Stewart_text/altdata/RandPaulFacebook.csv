"54172246106","Rand Paul","My campaign is showing the true path to Republican victory is with an uncompromising defense of our constitutional freedoms.

In fact, a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows me leading Hillary Clinton by a margin of 45%-37% among independents.

The media might not understand it. The Inside the Beltway crowd in Washington, D.C. doesn't get it.

But it's a new day in American politics.

The American people don't want Big Government under EITHER party.

They want to stop the career politicians from sinking our country further in debt.

They want to stop the ObamaCare train wreck.

They want a President who will stand and FIGHT the Washington Machine -- just like I did when I filibustered for ten-and-a-half hours and stood up to President Obama's radical NSA spying schemes.

That fight was the real deal. Renewal of the so-called ""PATRIOT Act's"" worst spying provisions was supposed to be a foregone conclusion. But you and I proved we can make a difference if we stand together and fight back.

Today, I'm asking you to help keep my momentum going by chipping in $20.16 right away to help my campaign ensure as many Americans as possible see my new TV ad.

This is a victory no matter how you look at it. It might be short lived, but I hope that it provides a road for a robust debate, which will strengthen our intelligence community, while also respecting our Constitution.

I acknowledge the need for robust intelligence and for vigilant national security. I believe we must fight terrorism, and I believe we must stand strong against our enemies.

The expiration of the NSA's sweeping, all-encompassing and ineffectual powers will not relinquish functions necessary for protecting national security.

The expiration will instead do what we should have done all along -- rely on the Constitution for these powers.

While some will use fear and intimidation tactics, I believe there is nothing that prevents our intelligence community from continuing to safely guard our nation, while also respecting our Constitution.

I will not allow any bill extending illegal NSA spying to be rushed through ahead of the deadline.

My oath is to support and defend the Constitution and I won't back down.

The abuse of general warrants and the attack on the Bill of Rights must stop once-and-for-all.
 
I believe we must fight terrorism and I believe we must stand strong against our enemies.
 
But we do not need to compromise the Constitution in the process. 
 
In fact, we must not.
 
So I hope I can count on you to sign your petition and stand with me as I force illegal NSA spying to expire and stand strong against any deals or threats.

"54172246106","Rand Paul","We have a momentous fight coming up in the senate tomorrow. Please read my entire statement on the extension of illegal NSA spying:

I have fought for several years now to end the illegal spying of the NSA on ordinary Americans. The callous use of general warrants and the disregard for the Bill of Rights must end. Forcing us to choose between our rights and our safety is a false choice and we are better than that as a nation and as a people. 

That's why two years ago, I sued the NSA. It's why I proposed the Fourth Amendment Protection Act. It's why I have been seeking for months to have a full, open and honest debate on this issue-- a debate that never came. 

So last week, seeing proponents of this illegal spying rushing toward a deadline to wholesale renew this unconstitutional power, I filibustered the bill. I spoke for over 10 hours to call attention to the vast expansion of the spy state and the corresponding erosion of our liberties.

Then, last week, I further blocked the extension of these powers and the Senate adjourned for recess rather than stay and debate them. 

Tomorrow, we will come back with just hours left before the NSA illegal spying powers expire.  

Let me be clear: I acknowledge the need for a robust intelligence agency and for a vigilant national security.

I believe we must fight terrorism, and I believe we must stand strong against our enemies.

But we do not need to give up who we are to defeat them. In fact, we must not.

There has to be another way. We must find it together.

So tomorrow, I will force the expiration of the NSA illegal spy program.

I am ready and willing to start the debate on how we fight terrorism without giving up our liberty.

Sometimes when the problem is big enough, you just have to start over. The tax code and our regulatory burdens are two good examples.  

Fighting against unconditional, illegal powers that take away our rights, taken by previous Congresses and administrations is just as important.

I do not do this to obstruct.  I do  it to build something better, more effective, more lasting, and more cognizant of who we are as Americans.","2015-05-30T14:34:40+0000","status",NA,"54172246106_10153098543091107",6759,364,1723

You and I can't settle for ""reforms"" that keep the NSA's bulk data collection in place but under another name. 

The time to end illegal NSA spying is NOW.

I'm not going to allow them to sneak this through Congress before a holiday.

If I could point to one thing in Washington, D.C. that lies at the very core of all the problems we face today, it's this . . .
 
It's the elitist belief that the Washington machine knows best for each and every one of us -- that bureaucrats can run our lives better than we can. 
 
This is the mindset that threatens the very survival of freedom in America.
 
And it's the mindset that was on full display when Hillary Clinton stated last week that Americans' ""deep-seated cultural codes, religious beliefs and structural biases have to be changed"" in order to create the Big Government utopia she's dreaming of.
 
I'll admit my jaw hit the floor when I read that statement!
 
If Hillary Clinton wants to run on a platform in 2016 of gutting Americans' religious freedom in order to ""fix"" us, all I can say is, ""Bring It On!""

You see, Hillary and her cronies don't have grassroots Patriots like you in their corner.

That's how a member of our party who appears to be the establishment's pick for 2016 recently described the NSA's illegal domestic spying program. 

I would say the best part of the Obama administration is when it's over and Barack Obama can do no more damage to the country. 

I'm in this race to defeat the Washington Machine and restore our liberties. 

And that starts with ENDING the NSA's illegal domestic spying program. 

The metadata collection program was created by the Executive Branch. 

And on day one in the Oval Office I will end this illegal assault on our rights. 

This race for President is going to be won one voter and one state at a time.

And candidates who back the surveillance state can always count on the big bucks from the well-connected who benefit from the Washington Machine. 

That's fine. 

I know grassroots patriots like you have my back. 

If you agree the NSA's illegal domestic spying program was one of the WORST parts of the Obama administration, I hope you will join the movement to take our country back.

Thanks to the support of tens of thousands of folks like you, our Stand With Rand Money Bomb hit three different fundraising goals and raised over $2 million - putting the establishment on notice.
 
It's been an exciting week - and I'm encouraged by the massive response to my message of liberty.

But it's going to be a long race, and my campaign can't afford to lose any steam. 

That's why I'm asking you to please help my campaign continue to build momentum by making a generous donation to my Stand with Rand Money Bomb before tonight's deadline: https://secure.randpaul.com/?defeathillaryvideo&sr=415fb1

"54172246106","Rand Paul","There is no greater responsibility for any legislator or any leader than to determine when we go to war. The consequences are potentially ominous. That responsibility should never be given to anyone who frivolously and cavalierly calls for war. War brings with it great obligations. These obligations don't end when our brave young men & women return from war. It's the beginning. 

One thing I know is true: we owe a debt of gratitude to the men and women who fight for our Bill of Rights & no one should ever forget it. I will never forget our veterans. I will never forget our soldiers in the field. I vow to judge questions of war with a solemn and profound deliberation. I will never take the country to war without just cause or without the Constitutional approval of Congress. 

As commander in chief, the world will know that our objective is peace but the world will not to mistake our desire for peace for passivity. The world should not mistake reluctance for inaction. And if war should prove unavoidable, America will fight with overwhelming force and we will not relent until victory is ours.

Skyrocketing spending and $18.1 TRILLION in national debt . . .
 
Barack Obama's NSA illegally spying on the phone calls of innocent Americans . . .
 
The massive corruption and cronyism taking place under a cloak of secrecy at the Federal Reserve . . .
 
The trampling of the Bill of Rights and the flat-out disregard for our most basic freedoms . . .
 
And today I'm asking for your help to do something about it.

Seems to me, Senator Rubio is acting like an isolationist who wants to retreat to our borders and perhaps build a moat. I reject this isolationism.

"54172246106","Rand Paul","President Obama is not above the law and has no right to issue Executive Amnesty. His actions blatantly ignore the Separations of Powers and the principles our country was founded on. The President has said 22 times previously that he does not have the power to legislate on immigration. 

I believe that immigration reform is needed, however for true and effective reform, we must first secure the border. I will not sit idly by and let the President bypass Congress and our Constitution.

We can’t afford to keep sending the same liberals back to Frankfort year after year. They have followed the same policies of their party boss President Obama – higher taxes, more spending, and bigger government.
 
Fortunately, we have a great opportunity in 2014 to send a strong message to the big-government liberals in the State House and elect conservative-minded Republicans instead.

Born in 1884, Warley was editor of the Louisville News and president of the Louisville chapter of the NAACP.

But, Warley is most famous for fighting and overturning the notorious Louisville ordinance that mandated segregated housing. Warley bought a house on Pflanz Avenue in the white section of Louisville, in defiance of the ordinance.

The case became Buchanan v. Warley and it made its way to the Supreme Court. In 1917, the Supreme Court ruled the ordinance unconstitutional, holding unanimously that Kentucky law could not forbid the sale of a house based on race.

"54172246106","Rand Paul","I agree with Ambassador Price. Do you?

Regime Change Will Not Diminish Al-Qaeda Attacks

By Ambassador John Price
 
In Syria how will the U.S. clearly define moderate opposition groups? That has become a major difficulty as well in Libya. Rebel groups break down into tribes, clans, and broader religious factions—some with fundamentalist beliefs, while others have a more radical interpretation of Islam which includes armed jihad. In any event we do not know their ultimate goals. A Muslim diplomat once told me it is difficult to know the mission of a person carrying a weapon: “When they come, they also bring their behavior with them. There is one baggage that doesn’t weigh much--it is the behavior that is inside of them--the behavior in their mind--the attitude that they have. We can search their pockets for weapons--and see the one’s on their shoulders--but we cannot search their mind”.

Syria over the last three years has been in a chaotic civil war in which no one has clearly defined the “moderate” opposition that could rule democratically, if we take out President Bashar al-Assad. I have written articles saying, “regime change without an endgame plan is fraught with disaster”, as we witnessed in Libya after the U.S.—NATO incursion in 2011 that led to the downfall of the ruler Col. Muammar Gadhafi. Armed Islamist militias have since taken over large swaths of the country.

The Senate Armed Services Committee last week passed the National Defense Authorization Act that authorizes military training and equipping of Syrian opposition forces. Which forces are they referring to?  Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) was the only one on the committee to vote against the initiative—a brave move. The Obama Administration has clandestinely been providing arms to the rebel forces, facilitated by Arab nation allies. However most of the weapons have ended up in suspect hands--Islamists affiliated with al-Qaeda—such as al-Nusra Front, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, Ahrar al-Sham and up to sixty other splinter insurgent groups. Many villages are now controlled by these groups. So who are we planning to train? We have had a history of training moderate rebel groups that turned against us in Afghanistan and Iraq. Who will be our medical advisor to determine what is in their minds?  I would opt for a more political solution, or the rebels we train will end up fighting alongside al-Qaeda at some point—since there is no clear vetting process.

Senator Lee appropriately noted, “The situation in Syria is desperate, and we should be constantly assessing it for threats to U.S. security, but I am concerned that sending American weapons and training into this crisis could be like pouring gas on a fire”. The news media validated the conundrum on-going in Libya noting, “Militia fighters stole hundreds of American-supplied automatic weapons and other equipment in a raid...where the U.S. was training local forces (AFP), and “Gunmen attacked the home of Libya’s new premier [third this year]”. In response to these concerns President Barack Obama instructed that naval ships be stationed off the coast of Libya in case the U.S. embassy in Tripoli needs to be evacuated.

The al-Qaeda affiliate in Libya, Ansar al-Shariah has vowed to attack American interests for our support of  former Libyan General Khalifa Haftar, who independently launched airstrikes recently against the February 17 Martyrs Brigade in Benghazi—the same group that had been hired to protect the U.S. consulate that was attacked by Islamists, wherein four Americans were killed, including U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens. The general has been accused of being an “American agent”. Escalating attacks by Ansar al-Shariah Islamists, in neighboring Tunisia, this week also killed four police officers when they attacked a government minister's home.

Chaos continues three years after the U.S.-NATO led incursion into Libya to depose Col. Muammar Gadhafi--without an endgame plan. The allies wanted to get rid of the dictator who had been a thorn in their side for many years. However no leader has surfaced from all of the rebel groups who could rule democratically. The same will hold true in Syria, a tribal society, where it will be almost impossible to find a leader who can rule justly without having to exert dictatorial powers to survive. Tribal hierarchy will trump free, fair and transparent elections.

Egypt was another example where the Western powers wanted to depose the dictator, General Hosni Mubarak who had for over thirty years been a U.S. ally--honoring the 1979 Israeli Peace Accord--and protected our unimpeded access to the Suez Canal. But that was not good enough, so the U.S. coached the Muslim Brotherhood’s candidate Mohamed Morsi on how to win an election. We should have realized that Morsi’s goal was to create an Islamic state ruled under Sharia law. As it turned out he lasted only one year before moderates and secular military officers ousted him. The Obama Administration did not understand the mission of the Muslim Brotherhood, which has been to turn Egypt into an Islamic state since its founding in 1928.

President Obama is struggling with pressure from congressional leaders wanting to supply military assistance to “select” opposition rebel forces in Syria. Security and military advisors are not sure who the moderate opposition groups really are—or a leader that could unify the country, without differing religious and ethnic groups becoming further victims. It is not an easy decision--to satisfy the political hawks—to depose President al-Assad. In ousting Col. Gadhafi in Libya his Warfalla minority tribe was slaughtered. This same fate awaits Mr. al-Assad’s minority Alawite tribe.

In authorizing the U.S. military involvement in Syria Mr. Obama needs to understand there are thousands of al-Qaeda affiliated Islamists fighting there, including dozens—possibly hundreds—of American jihadists fighting alongside. Together they are attacking both Syrian government and rebel forces. The populous is now beginning to experience a new type of attacks--suicide bombings by the trained American jihadists. Ousting Mr. al-Assad will not bring about the democratic institutions envisioned by the U.S.--only further the destabilization of Syria—joining Libya, Tunisia, Egypt, and nearby Yemen, all subject to a never ending chaos.

The U.S. has a poor track record of success in regime change in North Africa and the Middle East. Clandestinely supplying armaments to the “right"" rebels”has not been any better. Protecting American interests has also failed, as we witnessed in the numerous on-going attacks. If the U.S. wants to make a difference, we need to institute a more believable foreign policy—as the global leader—and that regime change should not be at the top of the list. We cannot take-on every dictator we disagree with, nor can we police over half the world. We need to focus more on the Global War on Terror—which is a growing concern. The global extremist Islamic movement has expanded since the death of Osama bin Laden--and if not curbed could eventually reach our doorstep again.

The United States should make it abundantly clear to Russia that we expect them to honor the December 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which the U.S., Russia, and the United Kingdom reaffirmed their commitment ‘to respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine.'

Russia should also be reminded that stability and territorial integrity go hand in hand with prosperity. Economic incentives align against Russian military involvement in Ukraine. Russia, which has begun to experience the benefits of expanded trade with World Trade Organization accession, should think long and hard about honoring their treaty obligations and fostering the stability that creates prosperity for its citizens. Most importantly, Russian intervention in Ukraine would be dangerous for both nations, and for the rest of the world","2014-03-01T03:17:40+0000","link","http://www.randpaul2016.com/2014/02/senator-rand-pauls-statement-situation-ukraine/","54172246106_10153897400350215",15014,1408,1291

"54172246106","Rand Paul","OFFICIAL STATEMENT CONCERNING NSA SEIZURE OF VERIZON PHONE DATA:

The National Security Agency's seizure and surveillance of virtually all of Verizon's phone customers is an astounding assault on the Constitution. After revelations that the Internal Revenue Service targeted political dissidents and the Department of Justice seized reporters' phone records, it would appear that this Administration has now sunk to a new low.

When Sen. Mike Lee and I offered an amendment that would attach Fourth Amendment protections to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act last year, it was defeated, and FISA was passed by an overwhelming majority of the Senate. At the time, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid remarked that FISA was ""necessary to protect us from the evil in this world."" 

The Bill of Rights was designed to protect us from evil, too, particularly that which always correlates with concentrated government power, and particularly Executive power. If the President and Congress would obey the Fourth Amendment we all swore to uphold, this new shocking revelation that the government is now spying on citizens' phone data en masse would never have happened.","2013-06-06T15:38:49+0000","link","http://www.paul.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=837","54172246106_10151556974326107",13862,1493,5008

"54172246106","Rand Paul","Joe Arnold of WHAS11.com reports:

Perhaps what continues to be the most significant story in all three major polls released so far (Survey USA and Daily Kos Research 2000 the other two) is that Republican Rand Paul is no fluke.
